(\"Sleigh\") was adopted by the Soviet Army in 1981 as a replacement to the storied, World War 2-era 120mm Model 1943 series detailed elsewhere on this site. The type improved engagement ranges, tactical flexibility, operating weight, and transportability while reducing the required crew by one. It retained all of the indirect fire usefulness of its predecessor, firing 120mm shells of various types (HE, incendiary, illumination, smoke) out to ranges of 4.5 miles. With the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991, the Russian Army absorbed the weapon in its ranks and other former Soviet states elected to retain their stocks as well. This has led to continued use by Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, and Lithuania. Egypt is a foreign customer of the 2B11.\n\r\nThe 2B11 takes on a conventional field mortar form, incorporating the launch tube, bipod assembly, an MPM-44M optics set, and baseplate. A two-wheeled, rubber-tired carriage is integral and allows for quick displacement or transport under combat conditions. The complete system weighs 460lbs. The launch tube's mounting hardware provides an elevation reach of +45 to +80-degrees with an inherent traverse function of +/- 5 degrees from centerline. A trained crew can fire about 15 rounds per minute for sustained fire actions. Minimum engagement range is 0.30 miles with the maximum being 4.46 miles.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "45d97943-a272-4a54-80e1-afc3a881f4f3", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "2B14 Podnos", "weapon_type": "82mm Infantry Mortar", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2B14 \"Podnos\" is a Soviet-originated battlefield mortar of 82mm caliber. The system is of conventional design arrangement and function and has seen service since the 1980s. Design work was undertaken in 1983 with serial manufacturing had from the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant. The system has seen consistent action since introduction, fielded in such conflicts as the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present), and the Ukrainian-Russian War (2014-Present).\n\r\nThe mortar is made up of typical components as mortars go: the launch tube, the bipod support assembly, and recoil plate. The complete system tips the scales at 92.3 lb and requires a crew of four for optimal function. The launch tube is rated for 6lb High-Explosive (HE) projectiles of 82mm (3.2\") caliber and a trained crew can let loose with 30 rounds-per-minute of in-direct fire. The mounting hardware allows for an elevation span of 45- to 85-degrees and inherent traversal of +/- 8-degrees. Anything more than this required complete relocation of the mortar system. Effective range is out to 2.65 miles.\n\r\nThe weapon can be transported by the available 2F510 series 2x1 wheeled assembly or by a dedicated prime mover vehicle such as the GAZ-66 series military 4x4 wheeled truck or similar wheeled or tracked solution.\n\r\nBeyond its service with the Soviet Union, the mortar was purchased by the fighting forces of Georgia, Malaysia, Syria, and Ukraine and has also been seen in use with Lebanese militia elements. Unlike other Soviet weapons of the Cold War period, the 2B14 series did not go on to see widespread global acceptance. Former Soviet mortars were absorbed into the newly-established Russia Army after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and under 300 are believed to still be in active circulation with Russian forces while some 3,000 remain in storage (and assumed available if needed).\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Army has actively used its 2B14 systems against Russian troops and separatist supporters in its War in Donbas in the East of the country. Novorossiya rebels are known to have used these weapons against Ukrainian forces as well.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "0fa9a6a0-ee38-4722-9436-0e63f44abb94", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "2B9 Vasilek (Cornflower)", "weapon_type": "82mm Towed Heavy Gun-Mortar", "description": "\r\n        \tThe mortar as a battlefield weapon has been a mainstay of militaries for decades. In 1970, the Soviet Army introduced a new heavy-class \"gun-mortar\" as the 2B9 \"Vasilek\" - or \"Cornflower\". The system fired 82mm projectiles out to ranges of 4,270 meters reaching rates-of-fire up to 120 rounds-per-minute. With the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s-early 1990s, the weapon passed on to the modern Russian Army and the armies of Armenia and Ukraine. A foreign customer of the product became Syria.\n\r\nFor mobility, the 2B9 was set atop a heavy-duty, two-wheeled split-trail carriage system which allowed towing by mover vehicle or large-scale traversal adjustments by the crew (of at least four to six personnel). A sighting device allowed for more precise firing through up to 3x magnification. The launch tube could be loaded through its breech assembly or down the muzzle. The tube's mounting hardware held an inherent traverse span of 60-degrees to either side from center and an elevation span from -1 to +85 degrees. Each 82mm projectile weighed seven pounds. A recoil mechanism was fitted about the launch tube to contend with the forces at work. A circular baseplate was lowered prior to firing which raised the unit from its wheeled support while the rear of the system was suspended by the split-trail carriage arms.\n\r\nOriginal Vasilek models were the 2B9 series and these were followed by a modernized form in 1983 designated as the \"2B9M\". In 1988, a vehicle-mounted form emerged for use on MT-LB Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) which broadened the tactical value of both vehicle and weapon considerably - very useful combination for the indirect fire support role.\n\r\nThe Vasilek weapon has been in constant use since its inception, being seen as recently as in the fighting of the Syrian Civil War (2011-????) (by both rebel elements and government forces) and in the Donbass Region of the Ukrainian Civil War (2014-????) (again by rebel elements and government forces).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "9651435a-46c2-4a34-b23c-8d10761421c8", "year_model": "1982", "weapon_name": "Accuracy International L96", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe L96A1 is an Accuracy International-produced sniper rifle and currently the sniper rifle of choice for the British Army. The L96 features an adjustable butt, integrated adjustable bipod and static iron sights  (though a 6x42 Schmidt & Bender scope was issued standard in original production models). The L96 originally competed successfully against the Parker-Hale Model 85 rifle in the mid-1980's to become the standard British Army sniper rifle, replacing the aged Lee-Enfield L42A1 series. The engineering process incorporated light alloys, plastic and metal into the design. This melding allowed for greater field abuse (the weapon could take a good deal of external punishment but still keep the internal components in good working order).\n\r\nDesigned to achieve first-round hit at 600 meters and \"harassing fire\" out to 1,100 total meters, the Accuracy International L96 sniper rifle has been upgraded with a new x3-x12 x50 sight and spotting scope. Select units also field the L115A1 Long range Rifle (LRR), which fires an 8.59mm bullet, heavier than the 7.62mm round of the L96 and less likely to be deflected over extremely long ranges. The L96A1's free-floating barrel is constructed of stainless steel and can be changed in 5 minutes. The system itself is designed to allow the single user the ability to carry out all but the most major repairs by himself in the field with the necessary tools being three Allen wrenches and a screwdriver.\n\r\nThe L96A1 is chambered to fire the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge from a 10-round detachable box magazine. An adjustable bipod is fitted forward under the barrel. The weapon features a muzzle velocity of 2,790 feet per second. The L96A1 can also be issued with a variety of scope mounts, collapsible stock and silencer and is available on the commercial market. A military .50 caliber (12.7mm) model is also available.\n\r\nThe L96 is part of the larger Accuracy International \"Arctic Warfare\" line of rifles for use by military, special forces and law enforcement branches. The L96A1 is the British Army designation of the Accuracy International PM (\"Precision Marksman\") model entered into competition to become the standard British sniper rifle.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "caef90ce-35d3-49e3-9b6a-4883bd89af2c", "year_model": "1975", "weapon_name": "APS (Avtomat Podvodny Spetsialny)", "weapon_type": "Underwater Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tSince special infantry elements require special weapons to achieve their given tasks, Soviet engineers designed the APS (\"Avtomat Podvodny Spetsialny\" = \"Special Under Water Assault Rifle\") to meet the needs of Soviet frogmen charged with countering the threat posed by underwater enemies such as the Navy SEALs of the United States. The design challenge lay in creating a weapon that could also retain some killing power on dry land which resulted in the selection of a gas operated system with a rotating bolt arrangement not unlike the original Kalashnikov AK-47. In order to succeed in its primary role of firing underwater, the weapon was chambered for a unique fin-stabilized dart/bolt as opposed to traditional cartridged ammunition. The metal dart measured nearly 5 inches long (its caliber officially listed as \"5.66x39mm MPS\") and sported a pointed head and bulged rear (representing the cartridge). The cartridge's specifications were akin to that of the Soviet 5.56x45mm round. The bolts were fired through a repeating action and down a smoothbore barrel assembly (as opposed to a rifled one). The end result was the APS which has been notably used by SPETSNAZ special forces since its inception.\n\r\nExternally, the APS is highly recognizable primarily due to its oversized magazine which is required by the stacking shape of the metal darts. The receiver is rectangular in its appearance and features a fixed angled pistol grip with trigger unit at the rear. There is an extendable twin-strut wire buttstock affixed for shoulder supporting - its collapsible nature ensures a compact weapon for underwater movement. The butt slides along two channels to either side of the receiver. The gas system is fitted over the barrel as in the Kalashnikov family of automatic weapons. The barrel extends a short distance ahead of the gas cylinder. Overall length with the butt extended is 32.5 inches and 24 inches when collapsed while overall weight is a manageable 5lbs when empty and approximately 7.5lbs when loaded.\n\r\nThe weapon's range is inherently limited in water and on land because of the specialized darts it fires. Maximum underwater range just over 30 feet though environmental factors such as depth come into play. On land, the weapon can reach out to ranges of 330 feet though accuracy degrades rather quickly - the internal makeup of the barrel is smoothbore and the metal darts are not entirely designed for ground-based warfare. Muzzle velocity (through the air) is roughly 1,200 feet per second. The APS makes use of a 26-round plastic detachable box magazine which adds much drag in underwater movement.\n\r\nThe APS rifle has been produced under the brand labels of Tula Arms Plant and TsNIITochMash since 1975. Design of the weapon is attributed to Vladimir Simonov. Soviet underwater forces were also issued specialized underwater-firing pistols during the Cold War years - though of equally limited range. The APS was eventually replaced by the more modern ASM-DT rifle which entered service in the new millennium - also produced by the Tula Arms Plant though now for the Russian Army in 5.45x39mm chambering (still retaining the gas-operated action and 26-round magazine).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3cddbbe6-db56-4079-98ae-75fab18abc57", "year_model": "1987", "weapon_name": "AS Val (Avtomat Special'nyj)", "weapon_type": "Silenced Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AS Val is a specialized automatic firearm of Soviet-era origin - essentially an assault rifle weapon system with a permanent silencer installed for clandestine operations. The weapon was designed by the TsNITITochMash state design bureau while production was charged to the famous Tula Arms Plant, the latter amazingly in existence since 1712. The AS Val first appeared in Soviet inventories in 1987 and has since been issued (primarily) to special forces (including Spetsnaz) and top-level security groups though it has also become a staple of the regular Soviet/Russian Army over time.\n\r\nThe heart of the AS Val is its \"subsonic\" ammunition which works extremely well in conjunction with the silencer component. The weapon is chambered for the \"9x39mm SP-6\" cartridge which is a rifle-caliber 7.62x39mm case with a special \"widened\" neck designed to accept a 9mm bullet - the latter a cartridge very common to semi-automatic pistols and submachine guns. This modified Soviet/Russian cartridge has continued to find growing use throughout other specialized weapon families of the Russian military since its inception. As a whole, the AS Val is key to the stealthy nature required of certain combat elements - where neutralizing unsuspecting sentries or fighting one's way out of trouble without garnering unneeded attention is something of a trademark.\n\r\nOutwardly, the AS Val showcases conventional lines consistent with other assault rifle designs. The receiver holds the major internal working components while the trigger group and pistol grip are well-integrated into the weapon's layout. The trigger is large, suitable for a gloved hand, while the pistol grip is rather plain and not as rearward-angled as in other Kalashnikov-style weapons. The buttstock consists of a metal framework and is collapsible over the left side of the receiver. Its skeletal nature ensures a lighter overall weight and does not impede regular gun functions for the charging handle and ejection port are set to the right side of the body. Magazines are fed just ahead of the trigger group and include 10-, 20- or 30-round detachable, curved box magazines though the 20-round version appears as the standard for the series. The specialized cartridges stacked within the magazine make the magazine deeper than a traditional box. A magazine release is noted just aft of the magazine well and ahead of the trigger component - a Kalashnikov identifier. There is a short forend handgrip set ahead of the receiver and magazine regions. Ahead of this is the principle identifying feature of the AS Val - the heavy duty silencer which appears as nothing more than a featureless cylinder simply added to the gun structure. The silencer is designed and constructed in such a way that the weapon can fire on full-automatic consistently without the silencer assembly suffering any irreversible fracturing in the short-term. A selector switch near the trigger allows for full-automatic or single-shot fire modes. The sights are affixed to the silencer assembly which clears the upper receiver from structural \"clutter\". Therefore, scopes or other accessories can be affixed to the weapon. Sighting does include standard adjustable iron fixtures (rear sector sight, front post) while various optics (including night scopes) can be installed along the top of the receiver.\n\r\nThe firing action of the AS holds origins in the tried-and-true Kalashnikov pattern and consists of a conventional gas-operation with a rotating bolt. As in other Kalashnikov guns, the gas cylinder is set above the barrel. Rate-of-fire is approximately 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of about 970 feet per second. As with most \"silenced\" weapons, range is limited when compared to that of traditional, non-silenced assault rifles - the AS Val managing effectiveness out to 300 meters with a maximum \"reach\" out to 400 meters. This is largely due to the heavier cartridge and sound suppression system, which lower the muzzle velocity considerably. Overall length of the weapon with the stock extended is 35 inches while a folded stock creates a more compact 24-inch form - suitable for close-in fighting.

In the latter action both the Russian and Georgian special forces utilized the weapon. \n\r\nThe \"AS\" designation is born of the Russian \"Avtomat Special'nyj\" terminology, which translates to \"Special Automatic Rifle\".

The major difference between the two systems is the AT-13s newer missile which sports larger dimensions, an increased operational range and modern internal technology. It is produced by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau and entered service with the Russian Army in 1992 to serve alongside mechanized armored units. KBP has a long-standing history after their founding in 1927 in Tula and the firm has gone on to produce a variety of anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-infantryweapon systems for the Soviet/Russian military. Several Soviet/Russian-allied nations have also moved on procuring the relatively new weapon system to help modernize anti-tank forces and include Croatia, South Korea, Iran and Syria. The Saxhorn-2 allows for on-the-spot, point-defense against all types of armored vehicles as she is made to be highly portable with thought given to ease and expediency of use.\n\r\nThe Saxhorn-2 system is made up of three major components consisting of the 9M131F missile, the 9P151 launch tube and a 1PBN86-VI thermal imaging sight. The standard operating crew is three personnel which facilitates both the firing action and transport of the Saxhorn-2 system as a whole. Setup of the Saxhorn-2 is roughly 15 seconds for a trained fire team (the launch tube is transported with a ready-to-fire missile in place) however the missile can only be fired from a standing or prone position. Since the launcher is reusable, the fire team can actually supply a semi-consistent rate-of-fire of about three missiles per minute. At least five missiles are assigned each Saxhorn-2 fire team to facilitate reloading of the launcher. Since one missile is already in the launch tube with the main operator, the other four reloads are split as pairs between the two remaining personnel and these are carried in addition to their personal weapons. The Saxhorn-2 system measures in at 980mm with a 130mm diameter. Weight is roughly 13.8 kilograms. Like other anti-tank missile systems of this class, the Saxhorn-2 can also be fixed to fire from vehicles of various types, making for a mobile anti-tank weapons platform when required.\n\r\nThe 9M131F missile features a solid-fuel rocket booster engine that supplies an operational range between 0.08 and 1.5 kilometers (0.049 to 0.93 miles) - for the crews safety, weapons such as this generally have a minimum operating range. Speed at the height of its post-launch phase is approximately 656 feet per second (200 meters per second). The missile is guided to the target via a wire link (wire-guided) that receives commands and course corrections to provide for relative pin-point accuracy. The base missile is capped with a HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) warhead designed to penetrate armor facings. If equipped as such, the Saxhorn-2 fire team can also launch a thermobaric-based warhead missile against personnel or structures. Thermobaric weapons expand the traditional blast wave for greater detrimental effects using available nearby oxygen (as in a fuel-air bomb).\n\r\nIsraeli Army Merkava main battle tanks reportedly encountered Saxhorn-2s when combating Hezbollah forces in the 2006 Lebanon War. While Russia denied the sale of its missile systems to the group, it is believed these were obtained via Syrian connections which itself procured the anti-tank system from Russia.\n\r\nRussia formally designates the Saxhorn-2 as the 9K115-2 \"Metis-M\". AT-13 \"Saxhorn-2\" is the NATO reporting name.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "fa30c67c-6d13-4714-b9c0-21c25c3a1c3c", "year_model": "1998", "weapon_name": "AT-14 (Spriggan) / 9M133 (Kornet)", "weapon_type": "Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) System", "description": "\r\n        \tRussian military industry has not rested on its laurels with regards to viable armor-defeating measures - hence the relatively recent introduction of the 9M133 \"Kornet\" (\"Cornet\"), designated by NATO as the AT-14 \"Spriggan\".

Design and development of the system began in 1962 and serial manufacture of the AT-5 was conducted by the Tula Machinery Design Bureau and the weapon system officially entered service with the Soviet Army in 1974 and continues active operations today. The AT-5 was developed alongside the similar AT-4 \"Spigot\" (9K111 \"Fagot\"), the AT-5 being the larger of the two dimensionally but the both systems largely sharing much in the way of technology available to that time. This similarity means that the AT-5 missile can be used effectively with (later) production versions of the AT-4 launcher.\n\r\nThe AT-5 missile sports a weight of 32lbs with a length of 45 inches and a diameter of 135mm. The missile is capped with a tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) warhead that is detonated on contact with a hardened surface (armor, fortified walls, etc...). Propulsion is via an internal solid-fuel rocket motor that provides the AT-5 with a maximum operational range of approximately 2.5 miles with a speed equal to 660 feet per second. As with most launched missile systems, there is a minimum effective range of approximately 230 feet. As the AT-5 missile is wire-guided in nature, it requires the target to be in line-of-sight (LOS) with the launcher/operator. Guidance is only effective up to the length of the available wires leading from the launcher to the missile itself. The missile tracks itself to the target by reading a small transmitter at the rear of the missile as relative to the intended target. The missile then communicates corrected flight paths via the wire link to the launcher. The missile can be launched from both a man-portable launcher or from a launch affixed to a weapons mounting on a vehicle though the latter is most often seen. Both launch points offer up benefits with the man-portable versions being easier to conceal (for the sake of ambush) and the vehicle-mounted versions allowing for superior tactical mobility (perfect for hunting tanks).\n\r\nThe launch system contains the complete optics and launch mechanism critical to the AT-5 function. The operator actuates the trigger system which forces a gas generator on the missile to ignite and launch the missile free from the launch tube. It is only when the missile has safely cleared the launcher that an internal solid fuel rocket motor ignites to take over the flight path and sends the missile towards the intended target as dictated by the operator through the optical system. Four fins affixed to the missile ensure a proper trajectory and stability/rotation in flight. If the internal guidance system from launcher to the missile is affected by a tracking jammer emitted against it, the operator can then elect to guide the missile manually by way of the launcher itself.\n\r\nSince inception into the Soviet inventory, a variety of operators have stepped forward to embrace the anti-armor qualities of the AT-5. These include Egypt, Finland, Georgia, Indonesia, India, Iran, Poland, Turkey, Syria and Ukraine. Iran has taken to producing a local copy of the original weapon system under the designation of Towsan-1/M113 at the beginning of the century. These are thought to have been smuggled into Hezbollah hands due to Israeli claims that their tanks encountered them in the 2006 Lebanon War. The actual effect of these missile systems against Israel tanks is unknown. Other anti-tank systems are also thought to have found their way into the conflict through Syria according to Israeli reports.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4ff94bbd-4581-4aba-ab2b-ef114d3e8cc8", "year_model": "1979", "weapon_name": "AT-7 (Saxhorn) / 9M115 (Mongrel)", "weapon_type": "Portable Anti-Tank Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AT-7 \"Saxhorn\" (officially Russian designation of \"9K115 Metis\", Metis translating to \"Mongrel\") was developed to coexist alongside the AT-4 \"Spigot\" series of portable, anti-tank wire-guided missile systems in the Soviet Army inventory. The AT-4 was a large company level weapon system that was fielded with integrated optics, tripod and a large launch tube for the 9M111/9M111-2 and 9M111M series missiles. The weapon system went on to be used by over 30 counties around the world including many Soviet-friendly parties and was produced in the thousands. The AT-7 maintained much of the appearance of the original AT-4 but introduced a revised missile that was lighter in weight, made to modern specifications and featuring a simplified tripod assembly.\n\r\nLike other anti-tank weapons of this classification, the AT-7 is operated by two specially trained personnel - one to manage the optics and launcher and the other to reload the launch tube component. In this paired fashion, transporting the AT-7 system is divided between the two personnel and up to four missiles are carried by the group. The AT-7 was traditionally issued to such two-man fire teams at the company level as a part of the Soviet motorized rifle companies, each company to tally some three launchers each.\n\r\nAt its core, the AT-7 breaks down into three key components - these being the optics suite, the launch tube and the mount (the latter also known as a launch post). The AT-7 projectile consists of a three-fin stabilized missile that operates initially from a booster before the rocket motor takes over after clearing the launch tube. The missile is then guided along a wire attached from missile to launcher which means that range is somewhat restrictive and line-of-sight on the target is imperative. The missile's warhead is a HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) shaped charge and weighs in at 5.5lbs. Operational range is approximately 1,000 meters with a 40 meter minimum (the latter for the safety of the firing crew). Despite the standard issue of a tripod with the AT-7 launcher, the system can be fired from the shoulder. The AT-7 launcher can also be utilized in relatively confined spaces with a safety clearance of about six meters directly behind the launcher recognized.\n\r\nThe AT-7 Saxhorn first entered service with the Red Army in 1979 and continues in operation even today. Production has been handled by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. A newer, modernized version of the Saxhorn - designated as the \"AT-13 Saxhorn-2\" (known formally as the \"9K115-2 Metis-M\") - sports a revised missile that is heavier than the original design but features an increased operational range with better penetrative capabilities thanks to its larger warhead. The Saxhorn-2 entered operational service in 1992.\n\r\nTo date, operators of the AT-7 have included (beyond the Soviet/Russian army) Croatia, Hungary, Iran, Moldova, Poland and Syria. Hungary has been known as a producer of the weapon system for interested global parties.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "7864e36e-5576-4166-966a-ac2b94960e94", "year_model": "1963", "weapon_name": "Dragunov SVD (Snayperskaya Vintovka sistemy Dragunova)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle / Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tFor a good duration of the Cold War period, the Dragunov \"SVD\" (\"Snayperskaya Vintovka sistem'y Dragunova\") series of semi-automatic rifles stood as the standard-issue sniper rifle of Soviet troops, allied Warsaw Pact nations and Soviet export customers. The rifle was introduced in 1963 and quickly became respected for its reliability and accuracy with its actions based in the highly successful Kalashnikov series of automatic assault weapons (namely the AK-47). As a semi-automatic rifle, the Dragunov SVD was more akin to a Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR), terminology used today to differentiate a squad-level precision rifle over that of a traditional accuracy-minded sniper rifle (which typically uses a manual bolt-action system).\n\r\nThe Soviets had always been keen on using large powerful, man-stopping cartridges so it was no surprise that the SVD continued chambering for the ubiquitous 7.62x54mmR Soviet cartridge, this feeding from a 10-round detachable box magazine. The result was a precise and accurate weapon system capable of engaging targets out as far as 875 yards.\n\r\nWhile it was largely based on the Kalashnikov system, the Dragunov SVD became a whole new rifle design all its own. Internally, the action was slightly reworked from its long-stroke piston form to a short-stroke arrangement providing a lighter, reduced movement which was required to maintain accuracy. Coupled with a slightly reworked trigger offering  a smoother response and the SVD became the weapon of choice for \"headhunters\" requiring range and effectiveness as well as ease-of-use and general reliability. The base optics set became the \"PSO-1\" series daytime scope (with some limited Infra-Red capability built-in) and this was backed by traditional iron sights (including an adjustable rear notch). The 1PN51 / 1PN58 series night vision scopes were later supported. A wooden stock and related furniture became hallmarks of the SVD series (as well as other Soviet weapons of the day).\n\r\nOverall weight of the rifle was 9.5 kilograms with an unloaded magazine and the scope fitted. Overall length was 48.2 inches with the barrel measuring 24.4 inches long. A trainer shooter could manage to fire off about 30 rounds-per-minute if need be, compliments of the semi-automatic action.\n\r\nAn airborne infantry version was made as the \"SVDS\" and this model featured a folding tubular metal stock to allow for a compact footprint. The night vision-equipped version of this rifle became the \"SVDSN\". The \"SVU\" was a specialized model sporting a shortened barrel and arranged in a \"bullpup\" configuration which seated the action and feed aft of the trigger unit. It offered specialist troops (like Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs operators) better accuracy through additional measures instituted to help combat recoil. A selective-fire version of this weapon became the \"SVU-A\" and this model fed from a 20-round box magazine. The \"SVDK\" was an offshoot of the SVD line chambered in 9.3x64mm. A commercial version of the SVD was manufactured as the \"Medved\" (\"Bear\") and chambered in 9x54R cartridge (then later in 7.62x51mm NATO).\n\r\nPoland was a key operator of the SVD series throughout its time as part of the Soviet Union and ultimately developed a modernized form under the designation of \"SWD-M\". This offering involved the addition of a bipod assembly under the forend, use of a more powerful 6x42 magnification scope and a heavy-duty barrel assembly to fall more in line with a traditional sniper weapon. Romania developed their PSL rifle from the SVD framework as did Iraq with through their \"Tabuk\" and \"Al-Gadissiya\" sniper rifles.\n\r\nBeyond the aforementioned global operators were users ranging from Algeria and Argentina to Vietnam and Venezuela. Some took to local manufacture of the rifle product (both licensed and unlicensed) like NORINCO of China and their \"Type 79\". Finland knew the SVD as the \"7.62 TKIV Dragunov\" and Iran managed a local version as the \"Nakhjir 3 Sniper Rifle\".\n\r\nIts global proliferation meant that the SVD series went on to see considerable combat action during the course of its long-running service career. This has included the Vietnam War (1955-1975), the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Gulf War (1990-1991), the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1999), both Chechen Wars (1994-1996, 1999-2000), the wars in Afghanistan (2001-2014) and Iraq (2003-2011), South Ossetia (2008), the Libyan Civil War (2011) and the ongoing War in Donbass (2014-Present) and Syrian Civil War (2011-Present).\n\r\nDespite its age, the SVD continues to be a favorite amongst trained military personnel, guerilla fighters, rebels and sport shooters alike and will undoubtedly be one of those rare firearms to see the century mark in terms of consecutive years in service.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a17d7dee-0761-4c99-93d3-9e8956678185", "year_model": "1939", "weapon_name": "F1 (Hand Grenade - Soviet)", "weapon_type": "Hand Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \t\"F1\" is used to designate a variety of hand grenades of modern design and of the 20th century.

As such, the Soviet defense industry awoke and began a massive program to push the German Army back to Berlin. The F1 proved quite effective in its intended role and was, itself, based on the F1 grenade of French origin.\n\r\nDesign of the Soviet F1 was rather straight-forward. The external steel casing was ribbed to ensure a solid hand hold. The fuse was integrated to the grenade body and actuated by manual removal of a safety component. Range was as far as a soldier could throw it and the blast radius within was rather standard - 15 meters for optimal effect and out to 30 meters peripheral. Additionally, shrapnel could reach much further than that due to the explosion. The explosive filling was a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) base of 60 grams. The entire F1 unit weighed in at 600 grams and featured a diameter of 55 millimeters. The fuse could feature a delay of 0 seconds to 13 seconds, this variable nature ensuring that it could be both thrown within a window of relative safety, or used as a hidden boobytrap explosive of sorts, this triggered by some external means depending on the setup.\n\r\nThe F1 saw extensive service with the Red Army in World War 2. It was quantitatively produced to the point that it was also exported out to Soviet satellite nations and allies in the post-war world, ensuring its place in the annals of military history. Its reach was such that the weapon can still be found in the far off places of the world today, a testament to its effective design and global reach.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "0ad21c9a-7b68-475d-b7bc-f77b948abd61", "year_model": "1978", "weapon_name": "GP-25 / GP-30 GL", "weapon_type": "Single-Shot 40mm Muzzle-Loaded Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe GP series of under-slung, single-shot, muzzle-loading 40mm grenade launchers was developed for the Soviet Army rifleman beginning in 1972. Work spanned into 1978 to which limited production ensued under the KBP Instrument Design Bureau brand label. The type was made compatible with the Kalashnikov \"AK\" family of assault weapons and intended to broaden the tactical reach of the Soviet infantryman considerably - matching the American M203-armed infantryman per step. The weapon was designed to fire a standard FRAG (FRAGmentation) grenade, smoke, tear gas, anti-riot baton and a specialized \"bouncing\" grenade and, as such, the GP family of launchers could be called upon to handle a variety of anti-personnel tasks with varying levels of lethality.\n\r\nThe GP was developed around a \"High-Low Pressure System\" in which to handle the resultant recoil effects of the launching 40mm projectile without the need of a rocket-based propulsion system. The system was devised by German engineers in the latter stages of World War 2 and subsequently adopted by the Soviets in the post-war world. Similarly, the Americans developed their M79 breech-loading 40mm single-shot grenade launcher along the same lines and these saw widespread use in the Vietnam War before being replaced by the underslung 40mm M203 series mated to the M16 assault rifle.\n\r\nThe Soviet single-shot 40mm grenade launcher first appeared in limited form under the designation of \"BG-15\" to which then the definitive \"GP-25\" production mark was unveiled. A modernized and simplified form, the \"GP-30\", has since been introduced which has more-or-less replaced the original aging GP-25 series. The original GP-25 fielded an overall weight of 3.3lbs and overall length of 12.7 inches while the updated GP-30 was made lighter and shorter at 3lbs with a 10.8 inch length. Both shared the same 4.7 inch barrel length and muzzle velocity was equal at 250 feet per second, largely in line with Western offerings. In the GP system, 40mm grenades are actuated by a percussion cap type base which ignites the grenade's propellant, forcing the projectile from the muzzle end of the barrel. The internal makeup of the launcher's barrel is rifled to promote a rotating stabilizing effect on the exiting grenade which allows for greater engagement ranges and some level of accuracy at range when compared to smoothbore barrel types. Construction of the GP family of grenade launchers is noted as very robust, allowing for a prolonged service life in the worst of battlefield conditions - very much a part of Soviet weapons design philosophy.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a7b4e991-2db7-4b02-a4cd-58116c8dcadc", "year_model": "1994", "weapon_name": "Izhmash AN-94 (Abakan)", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AK-47 altered the world military stage by becoming a ubiquitous combat system available to the general masses. The weapon proved relatively inexpensive to produce and, perhaps more importantly, it was a robust field performer with a reliable action and easy-to-operate in the \"greenest\" of hands. As such, the AK-47 - Kalashnikov's best known and easily recognizable assault rifle - went on to be found in all parts of the world. Within time, the series was modernized with the changing era including a major facelift in the 1970s (the AK-74) and, again, in the 1990s (the composite-minded AK-100 series). The newest incarnation is the \"AK-12\" manufactured by the storied concern of Izhmash and currently (2012) undergoing evaluation by the Russian military to become the next standard-issue automatic weapon of its army. It is expected that the AK-12 will be produced through a \"family\" of automatic weapons to include the base assault rifle, a shortened carbine form, a compact submachine gun, a dedicated sniper/sharpshooter's rifle and a light machine gun consistent with prior Russian Army infantry doctrine (the AK-47/AK-74 itself was developed into varied forms to suit battlefield needs within time). The AK-12 designation marks the finalized production-ready form of the prototype AK-200 detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nWith the export market in mind and proliferation of different cartridge types around the world, the AK-12 will be an inherently modular product that, with some modification to the base internal arrangement and barrel, the weapon will be available in a variety of calibers to further suit customer requirements. Additionally, adoption of a Picatinny rail system now allows use of various non-Russian accessories including laser aimers, tactical flashlights, grips, night vision scopes, reflex sights and the like. In this way, the AK-12 system will be highly adaptable and just as highly marketable on the world stage.\n\r\nThe basic assault rifle form of the Russian Army will be chambered for the 5.45x39mm Soviet cartridge. There are two proposed NATO-standard forms in play - the 5.56x45mm NATO and 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge types. Additionally, support is expected for the 6.5mm Grendel and 7.62x39mm Soviet rounds as well. The firing action will remain consistent across all forms, however, and revolve around a proven gas-operated, long stroke piston utilizing a rotating bolt function. The AK-12 receiver will support the standard curved 30-round magazine, a 60-round AK-74-style casket or a 100-round drum (in the light machine gun role). Rate-of-fire is estimated between 600 and 1,000 rounds per minute based on configuration and cartridge size. Muzzle velocity is approximately 2,950 feet per second with an effective range out to 2,000 feet (again, depending on field conditions, selected cartridge and general weapon configuration). The AK-12 receiver will sport a more reserved ambidextrous thumb-actuated firing selector found near the pistol grip (as opposed to the traditionally large firing selector featured in AK rifles prior). The magazine release/catch will be located in its usual place behind the magazine well within easy reach. The gas cylinder will be set in its usual Kalashnikov arrangement just above the barrel assembly while the barrel will be capped by a new slotted muzzle brake.

Externally, the weapon is essentially similar in appearance to the AK-47 assault rifle.  This similarity is due to both systems being developed by the prolific and highly successful designer Kalashnikov, the hero of the Soviet Union. The success of the AK-47 led to the Soviet military asking for a similar design to replace the light machine gun that was in service at the time - the Degtyarev RPD. So Kalashnikov lengthened the AK with a heaver barrel and fitted a bipod to support sustained automatic fire. Kalashnikov also stole the RPD stock design, which was popular with the troops, and changed the rear sight to allow for windage adjustments.  The 30-round AK magazines were interchangeable, however, larger magazines of 40 rounds and a 75-round drum were needed to satisfy the full automatic requirement. The gun was eventually ordered for the Red Army in 1961 but did not enter service until 1964. Each infantry squad was issued one RPK along with the 75-round drum magazine. Airborne units were issued the RPKS featuring the folding stock.  \n\r\nThe RPK was produced to operate with ease and to be nearly jam free. A major bonus was the commonality of parts with the AK service rifle series. The RPK utilizes a simple gas operated system firing from a closed bolt. Pulling the trigger begins the firing action - a round is fired and gas is produced when the powder burns and enters a small gas port pushing small pistons. The bolt is pushed back and the gas pressure is released allowing the bolt to be pushed forward by a spring. For night actions the NSP-2 infrared sight can be attached.\n\r\nAs with all weapons the RPK has her drawbacks. The closed bolt firing action and the barrel are not a quick change in the field. If the operator has good fire discipline few problems occur, however in combat situations discipline can go out the window. Optimal sustained fire is around 80 rounds per minute - if overused, chambered rounds could \"cook off\" and barrel damage could ensue.  The size and weight of the box magazine is limited the amount of ammunition carried by the weapons crew - very different from the amount of belt ammunition carried around the necks of US soldiers in Viet Nam for the M60 general purpose machine gun.  \n\r\nThe RPK is still in service, seeing first combat action in the Vietnam War while it is being used by terrorists today in Afghanistan and around the world with many thousands having been produced.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c20cceb3-bdf3-4bca-8c7e-ba9c0d88603b", "year_model": "1995", "weapon_name": "Izhmash Saiga-12", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Combat Shotgun", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian firm Izhmash produces the impressive Saiga-12, a semi-automatic fire-capable combat shotgun that has earned a high level of respect for both its lethality and its reliability since its introduction in the 1990's. It is produced in a handful of variants and can fire a variety of ammunition types, calibers and magazines and can be operated in any climate. As the Izhmash firm had already maintained experience in production of Kalashnikov-pattern guns it is no surprise to see the commonality of design and parts between the Kalashnikov designs and the Saiga-12.\n\r\nThe base Saiga-12 sports an exterior look not unlike the Kalashnikov AK-47. In fact, the body appears essentially the same and features the identifiable lever-safety along the right side and the firing action is directly descended from the legendary AK-47. The pistol grip is fitted behind the trigger guard and angular detachable box magazine. Like AK-47's, the Saiga-12 also makes use of a low-fitting barrel with the gas tube mounted above. A wrap-around hand guard protects the user from touching the hot gas tube. The shotgun system also comes off of the same assembly lines that produce the Kalashnikov AK-74M and AK-100 rifle series and are denoted with the red Izhmash triangle logo featuring an upwards-facing arrow. The Saiga-12 can be manufactured with a traditional solid buttstock (Saiga-12), extending tubular buttstock or a skeletal collapsible stock (Saiga-12S, Saiga-12K, Saiga-12S EXP-01) for increased portability while still others  sport a traditional hunting rifle-style buttstock with integrated pistol grip. The system - for obvious reasons - also sports a much larger ammunition extraction hole for spent shell casings, this along the right side of the body. The overall finish is a matte black powder with a slight texture feel.\n\r\nThe Saiga-12 is characterized as a self-loading smooth bore 12-guage shotgun. The Saiga-12 can fire from a 2-, 5-, 8-, 10-, or 12-round detachable box magazines. Additionally, this can be replaced by a 20-round ammunition drum. The Saiga-12 is available in .30-06, 7.62x39mm, .308 Winchester, 9x53R, 5.6x39mm and .223 Remington calibers as well as 20- and .410 shot gauges. The firing operation is gas-operated, featuring a rotating bolt. The gas system is adjustable depending on the type of ammunition being utilized. Barrel options include lengths up to 24 inches and threaded/non-threaded types. One drawback of the firing system has been the lack of a hold-open bolt device after the last round is fired, resulting in a more complicated reloading process.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "e332a466-1f17-4901-b092-5eefe80f8dfc", "year_model": "1998", "weapon_name": "Izhmash SV-98", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian SV-98 sniper was brought about to replace the ages-old SVD series in some Russian agencies. While the SVD series proved a capable long-range sniping platform in its own right, it still maintained origins well-laid in the Cold War years. What modern Russia needed now was a more modern system taking into account the changing face of warfare, Russian doctrine in the post-Cold War world and technological advancements. Thusly, the SV-98 sniper rifle was born.\n\r\nDesign of the SV-98 - under the direction of Vladimir Stronskiy, began in 1998. The design was based on the Izhmash Record-CISM series. After a period of evaluation, serial production followed and was undertaken out of the Izhmash OJSC facilities with service entry of the weapon into the inventories of the Russian special forces - including Spetsnaz- and some police units in 1998.\n\r\nOutwardly, the SV-98 attains a most conventional appearance as sniper rifles go. All of the major internal working components are naturally housed in the receiver. An ergonomic shoulder stock is set to the rear of the weapon with the barrel ahead of the receiver. The system utilizes a pistol-style grip handle with an integrated trigger system protected within an oblong ring. A forestock is fitted to the lower forend of the receiver. The magazine feed it just ahead of the trigger unit along the bottom face of the receiver. The shoulder stock is constructed of laminated plywood and features a thumbhole, adjustable buttplate and cheek comb for comfort and can mount a carrying handle. A molded fiberglass stock can be substituted for the wood version when ordering. An adjustable bipod is standard as is a rear-set monopod. Loops at the forend and the stock can address the fitting of a shoulder strap for marching.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "6e975441-5769-4e43-ae5d-52dac0347fb7", "year_model": "2018", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov (Dragunov) SVDM", "weapon_type": "Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR) / Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe SVDM is an all-modern evolution of the classic Soviet-era SVD semi-automatic sniper rifle. With the widely-accepted use of the \"Designated Marksman\" in platoon / squad arrangements, the weapon has been categorized as a \"Designated Marksman Rifle\" (DMR) in modern military-speak. It retains much of the form-and-function of the original - including its rifle-caliber chambering, gas operation, and semi-automatic internal action - but has been evolved by way of various tactical finishes including broadened accessories support.\n\r\nThe SVDM is an offshoot of the earlier SVDS which was a version of the SVD rifle reworked to better suit airborne troopers requiring a more compact, lighter weight solution. As such, the stock was redesigned in skeletal / tubular form as a weight-savings measure and this entire assembly could now fold over the rifle's body along a hinge for improved transport. A heavy-duty barrel assembly was also introduced while being capped by a new, shortened flash hider.\n\r\nAs with the SVD before it, the SVDS was chambered in the proven 7.62x54mmR full-power rifle cartridge. The SVDM continues this chambering and brings along with it all of the changes introduced with the SVDS model. It has a heavy-duty barrel assembly of 21.7\" length (supporting a suppressor over the muzzle as needed) and a 1P88-4 telescopic sighting device as standard for daytime operations.\n\r\nThis incarnation of the classic SVD/SVDS rifle retains the general design lines save for it being completed in an all-black matte finish. The frame houses all pertinent operating functions including the charging handle and ejection port set to the right side. The magazine well is ahead of the more ergonomic pistol grip in the traditional way, accepting a curved, 10-round detachable form (the magazine release located just aft of the well). The pistol grip and trigger unit are set in their usual place with the trigger ring being oversized to accommodate a gloved hand. The forend is lightly slotted and shrouds most of the length of the gas assembly which sits over the barrel. The forward sight is positioned at the end of the gas cylinder and works in conjunction with a rear \"iron\" sighting device. The barrel protrudes a distance ahead and is capped by a slotted muzzle brake. A hinged, folding bipod (removable) can be affixed under the forend as a forward support.\n\r\nAt the rear of the frame is a skeletal, adjustable, and padded shoulder stock. As it is hinged, the assembly can be folded over the frame of the rifle for a more compact end-product (useful for when operating in confined spaces or for when \"on-the-march\"). Over the frame is a long-running section of Picatinny rail for the mounting of various optics, magnifiers, and aimers which can serve to enhance accuracy / precision at-range.\n\r\nOverall length of the weapon system is 44.7\" and this is brought down to 38.4\" with the stock folded. Weight is 12lb.\n\r\nAltogether, the SVDM can be a potent ranged weapon in the right hands. Changes have been implemented to make a Soviet-era product better suited to the rigors of the modern battlefield and broaden its tactical appeal.\n\r\nThe rifle entered service with Russian forces in June of 2018 and has been actively used by Russia in their ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Captured systems have been re-fielded by the Ukrainians in their valiant fight to defend home soil.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "8455a6e9-069b-40fa-9b64-003e5436fe74", "year_model": "1994", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov AK-103", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AK-47 altered the world military stage by becoming a ubiquitous combat system available to the general masses.

The SAW is unique in that it features the suppression capabilities of a true machine gun yet is chambered for a smaller, assault-style intermediate cartridge (as opposed to a full-powered rifle cartridge). While this reduces engagement ranges and penetration values at range, it provides the infantry squad with a weapon offering voluminous fire - the operator also being able to carry more ammunition into battle.\n\r\nThe \"RPK-16\" is being developed by modern Russian industry to provide a successor for the ages-old RPK-74 series Light Machine Gun (LMG) family of Cold War origin.

What modern Russia needed now was a more modern system taking into account the changing face of warfare, Russian doctrine in the post-Cold War world and technological advancements. Thusly, the SV-98 sniper rifle was born.\n\r\nDesign of the SV-98 - under the direction of Vladimir Stronskiy, began in 1998. The design was based on the Izhmash Record-CISM series. After a period of evaluation, serial production followed and was undertaken out of the Izhmash OJSC facilities with service entry of the weapon into the inventories of the Russian special forces - including Spetsnaz- and some police units in 1998.\n\r\nOutwardly, the SV-98 attains a most conventional appearance as sniper rifles go. All of the major internal working components are naturally housed in the receiver. An ergonomic shoulder stock is set to the rear of the weapon with the barrel ahead of the receiver.

The cartridge is based on the 7.62x39mm rifle round though this having its \"neck\" expanded to take on the 9mm bullet - a bullet most commonly found in semi-automatic handguns and submachine guns. The result is a close-quarters weapon with the destructive firepower of a full-length automatic rifle - for the 9x39mm is said to penetrate the latest is body armor while delivering a lower audible signature. Design and manufacture of the 9A-91 was/is the responsibility of the KBP Instrument Design Bureau.\n\r\nDesign of the 9A-91 is quite conventional as automatic weapons go and polymers are utilized for \"non-essential\" components of the gun such as the pistol grip and forward hand guard. This design initiative assists in keeping the weapon's weight to \"manageable\" levels. However, steel stampings are still utilized for construction of the receiver and critical internal components remain metal. The receiver is relatively featureless along the left side of the body while the right side houses the charging handle and ejection port. The 9A-91 features a metal stock that can be folded over the receiver to shorten the weapon's overall length considerably. Optics or accessories can be fitted along the top of the receiver for accurized close-quarters work. The pistol grip is conventional and slight angled rearwards for an ergonomic hold. The grip is integrated with the ring-protected curved trigger element while the trigger sits behind the magazine well. The weapon accepts a straight 20-round detachable box magazine white breaks from the curved magazine tradition of earlier Soviet/Russian assault weapons designs. The firing action is the traditional gas-operation with a rotating bolt unit. The forend is ribbed for a firm hold while only a small length of barrel protrudes ahead. In all, the selected design features promote a rather compact and stout assault weapon suitable for the most serious of police work.\n\r\nThe 9A-91 sports a rate-of-fire in the range of 700 to 900 rounds per minute - on par with many assault rifles. The lower velocity of the 9x39mm subsonic ammunition drastically lowers the effective range of the weapon to under 100 meters. While limited range is a detrimental feature to most any weapon, the type of police work required of elements utilizing a weapon such as the 9A-91 most often times fall within close ranges so the limitation is negligible.\n\r\nThe 9A-91 assault carbine forms the body of the VSK-94 silenced sniper rifle for Russian special forces.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "b7d122fb-2acf-4119-859e-d40e28b36f61", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "KBP AGS-17 Plamya (Flame)", "weapon_type": "30mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AGS-30 is the modern Russian military 30mm automatic grenade launcher for fire support, superseding the Cold War-era AGS-17 \"Plamya\" (\"Flame\").

The GM-94 is fielded with a basic steel skeletal shoulder stock that conveniently folds over the receiver for a more compact form when traveling or when forced to action in confined spaces. The folded shoulder stock also doubles as an ad hoc carrying handle when on the march. The barrel is surrounded by a noticeably ribbed casing which provides the forward horizontal grip position while acting as the needed pump-action slide facility. Sighting is through standard fittings across the top of the receiver with a flip-type rear. The weapon weighs in at 4.8 kilograms  and, with a full four-round load, 5.8 kilograms. It is finished in an overall non-reflective black coating.\n\r\nIn practice, the GM-94 is a very portable, lightweight system affording its operator an effective engagement range of 300 meters and maximum engagement range out to 500 meters. Base grenades project a lethal kill radius of 3 meters which safeguards the operator, especially in confined spaces, where the GM-94 allows engagement of a target or area from as little as 10 meters away. The weapon has proven very robust to date and can be fired from wet or dry conditions. Additionally, the availability of various grenade types allows the launcher to be utilized by military and law enforcement elements, the latter by way of tear gas rounds, bean bag slugs and other \"less-than-lethal\" projectiles. For military service, various grenade types are available which provide tactical flexibility against all manner of targets - personnel in close-quarters, dug-in foes and even lightly armored vehicles. However, the system does showcase some detractions including its rather cumbersome size which precludes the operator from having his primary weapon trained at the same time (compared to an underslung launcher fitting). Additionally, there is a considerable amount of recoil noted in the action during firing especially when compared to the smaller 40mm launcher types favored by the West.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4433563e-d061-497a-9e73-6c8025d8b1fb", "year_model": "1996", "weapon_name": "KBP OSV-96", "weapon_type": "Anti-Material Rifle (AMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian OSV-96 is a standard, no-frills large-caliber anti-tank/anti-material precision rifle system of conventional design.

The long-running free-floating barrel is capped by a large slotted muzzle brake to help dampen recoil effects. The firing action revolves around a gas-operation with rotating bolt mechanism and semi-automatic rate-of-fire - allowing the operator to fire off successive shots without manually managing a bolt. The box magazine holds 5 x 12.7x108mm cartridges (equivalent to the 12.7x99mm NATO) while optics are backed by traditional iron sights to maintain ranged capabilities should a scope fail. Overall length of the weapon is 1,746 millimeters with a 1,000 millimeter long barrel assembly and effective range is out to 2,000 meters. The weapon was designed in the 1990s and introduced in 1996, currently seeing service with Russian intelligence and special forces elements and Indian special marine units.\n\r\nThe anti-tank/anti-material rifle is an ever growing heavy weapons category of the modern battlefield. These weapon types can be utilized to attack all manner of lightly-armored or fortified high-value targets or emplacements. Optics allow for precision shooting at distance to the point that the operator can engage key systems on a vehicle (a combat tank for instance) or structure to render them useless. To put the value of large-caliber guns into perspective, these weapon types hold the capability to cut clean through engine blocks at range.\n\r\nAs is the case with most anti-material rifles, the OSV-96 is a dimensionally large and weighty weapon system requiring operation by specially-trained personnel. The weapon is designed to fold at the barrel/receiver for improved portability though its size and weight are still a concern. The weapon holds and inherently violent recoil which is consistent in the firing of such large cartridges so firing is generally from the prone position with the rifle balanced on its bipod assembly and the buttstock tucked into the operator's shoulder. The OSV-96 (as with all large-caliber rifles of this breed) gives off a very audible and visual blast effect which, in some cases, may expose the firer's position to the enemy. However, this is countered to an extent by the sheer penetrating capabilities of such a large-caliber firearm.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "8617ff80-1011-4685-9c4b-46c429d6a78c", "year_model": "1988", "weapon_name": "KBP RPO-A (Shmel)", "weapon_type": "Shoulder-Fired, Rocket-Propelled Flame Weapon", "description": "\r\n        \tDuring the late-Cold War period (1947-1991), the Soviet Army introduced a terrifying new anti-infantry weapon known as the RPO-A \"Shmel\". This shoulder-fired rocket launcher, considered a flamethrower by Soviet categorization, was designed around use of several rocket types including a primary thermobaric warhead-equipped type (RPO-A). There was also an incendiary rocket introduced (RPO-Z) as well as a general smoke-generating round (RPO-D). The series was introduced during the late 1980s and saw first-actions in the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), both Chechen Wars, and - more recently - in the ongoing Syrian Civil War (beginning 2011) and the War in Donbass (versus Ukraine).\n\r\nThe RPO-A was used to succeed the aging, outgoing line of flame-oriented RPO \"Rys\" launchers then in circulation.\n\r\nThe Shmel continues in service today and fires a 93mm caliber, 700mm long rocket from a shoulder-fired launch tube measuring 920mm out to an effective range of 200 meters. Minumum range is 20 meters and maximum range reaches out to 1,000 meters (though sighting is only up to 600 meters). The system weighs 11 kilograms and consists of the launch tube (with integral optics set and trigger unit), the spin-stabilized rocket and a launching canister component.\n\r\nThe RPO-M \"Shmel-M\" (PDM-A) is a modernized form of 2006 and differs in its 90mm caliber, 940mm length, and 8.8kg weigh load.

Design of the weapon began in the 1990s with production ramping up in 1998. Today, the Kord series has replaced the venerable 1970s-era \"NSV\" series in frontline use (itself a replacement for the World War 2-era ubiquitous DShK series) with Russian military forces and has been featured in a variety of roles throughout its relatively short career to date. The Kord Heavy Machine Gun has seen operational use with both Russian police forces as well as the military. Production of all Kord machine guns is handled out of the V.A. Degtyarev Plant in Russia.\n\r\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Army made extensive use of the NSV series of heavy machine guns across various deployments to counter threats from light armored vehicles, concentrations of dug-in enemy troops and low-flying aircraft - particularly helicopters and strike aircraft. From 1990 on, the vast hardships fell across most of the Soviet Union's political, social and economic fronts, forcing an all-out collapse of the empire and independence for its 15 republics. This worked to cut off some of the resources and production facilities the Soviet military had come to rely on as the Russian military budget was also curtailed and development of key systems was either stalled or canceled outright. Much Soviet production of the NSV series happened to center in the region of modern day Kazakhstan so those facilities were effectively dropped in the transition. Throughout the remainder of the decade, renewed Russian authorities charged the famed Degtyarev concern with design and development of a new modern heavy machine gun solution in the same vein as the NSV before it (including use of the Soviet-era 12.7x108mm cartridge, lightweight construction and a higher rate-of-fire). The result was the similarly-appearing Korg family of heavy automatic weapons that has since gone on to become a new Russian military standard - while the NSV continues service with former Soviet-allied nations today. The Korg HMG entered service with Russian forces in 1998 with production still ongoing.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c91a4951-661a-4ee3-b1b1-e8ada935c535", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "KS-23", "weapon_type": "Carbine / Shotgun Assault Weapon", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile displaying an appearance more akin to a shotgun, the Russians designate their KS-23 as a \"Special Carbine\" (KS = \"Karabin Spetsialniy\") due to its large-caliber rifled barrel assembly (unlike conventional shotguns that make use of smoothbore barrels). The KS-23 utilizes a massive 23mm round which has more in common with the Soviet anti-aircraft projectile than a standard shotgun slug. Considering the KS-23 was developed from abandoned anti-aircraft cannon barrels that failed quality control testing, this is not a surprise for the KS-23 was developed as a specialized anti-riot weapon by reconstituting these \"flawed\" 23mm barrels. The size and construction of these barrels proved well-formulated for the use of special, low-powered projectiles and, thusly, the barrels began appearing in a shorter, cut-down form to produce the new \"KS-23\". The Soviet concern of Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod was charged with its production while design was attributed to TsNIITochMashwith development occurring throughout the 1970s. TsNIITochMash is the \"Central Research Institute for Precision Machine Building\" that makes its name as a primary Soviet/Russian military and internal security firearms producer. The KS-23 entered service with Russian police forces in 1985.\n\r\nAt its core, the KS-23 is a manually-actuated, pump-action slide weapon system that, for all intents and purposes, is a \"shotgun\" classification by Western standards though larger in scale by any respect.  The system weighs in at 3.85 kilograms and sports a running length of 1,040mm with a barrel length of 510mm (in her basic form). Her formal caliber is listed as 23mm which becomes 6.27 gauge in American nomenclature while the feed system consists of tubular magazine housed under the barrel. The magazine can only hold 3 x 23mm shells though a fourth round can be chambered \"ready-to-fire\" and increases total ammunition capacity to four. Iron sights are integrated as standard and the internal firing system concerning the 23mm requires use of a multi-lug locking bolt assembly. The KS-23 has seen various shells developed for its unique design including basic buckshot, solid steel slug, non-lethal rubber slugs, tear gas and flash-bang shells. Militarized versions can add the optional muzzle attachment for firing barrel-launched grenades of various types (primarily tear gas for riot control) as well as grapple hooks and the like for special forces elements.\n\r\nThe KS-23 designation identifies the initial production models and basic security-minded KS-23 form. The type sports a 510mm long barrel assembly which differentiates it from the other KS-23 production marks. The militarized version is the KS-23M \"Thrush\" production model which does away with the solid wooden shoulder stock of the base offering and is completed with a handier, shorter 410mm length barrel. Some examples of this model have been identified with or without a wire-type stock. In either case, the KS-23M ends up being lighter in weight and easier to handle as a result. The KS-23K is the KS-23 completely rearranged into a \"bullpup\" configuration (the action now being located aft of the pistol grip and trigger unit) to take advantage of the inherent internal space generated by the required larger shoulder stock . The new arrangement allowed for an internal magazine of up to seven shells as opposed to the three-shell limit of the original production models. The KS-23K appeared in the late 1990s. The KS-23, in its civilian market guise, is known as the TOZ-123 \"Drake\" but is only available in the tree-shell form and banned in some countries.\n\r\nThe KS-23 series has only seen limited use since its inception - no doubt due to the weapon's very specific nature and ammunition. Nonetheless, she remains one of the most powerful - if not the most powerful - \"shotgun\" type systems the world over.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ea8cfb95-be63-432a-be59-791d26d40883", "year_model": "1999", "weapon_name": "KSVK 12.7 (ASVK)", "weapon_type": "Anti-Materiel Rifle (AMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe KSVK 12.7 is a heavy anti-material rifle designed by Russian for specialized Russian Army forces. The weapon is intended for disabling light military vehicles, penetrating fortified enemy positions and counter-sniping duties. Development of this weapon system began at the end of the 1990s under the guidance of ZID, formerly the Degtyarov Plant, makers of World War 2-era anti-material rifles. The Russian Army saw extensive experience in the decade with their two wars against Chechen rebels and the need for a capable and modern anti-material rifle was never more apparent. The KSVK 12.7 was initially known under the designation of ASVK and is based on the earlier SVN-98, an experimental anti-material rifle.\n\r\nThe KSVK 12.7, as its designation suggests, is chambered for the 12.7x108mm cartridge and operates from a manually-actuated bolt-action system that feeds a single round from a spring-loaded, 5-round detachable box magazine. The weapons weighs 12 kilograms sans any optics installations and features a length of 1,400mm with a barrel length of 1,000mm. The rear-fed nature of the magazine (rear of the pistol grip that is) categorizes the KSVK as a \"bullpup\" configured rifle design. Design of the receiver is essentially tubular with a shoulder stock added to the rear for additional support. The shoulder stock features a noticeable ergonomic curve and a bipod is fitted ahead of the receiver as standard. The pistol grip and trigger unit are mounted under the receiver at about the midway point in the design. A long, perforated muzzle brake caps the barrel to help retard the inherent effects of the massive recoil delivered from the firing of the powerful 12.7mm cartridge. The standard rifle design incorporates iron sights for the user but the weapon is designed (by way of an accessories rail) to accept common day/night optics as needed. These optics are fitted just above the pistol grip unit.\n\r\nThe KSVK 12.7 is currently in service with a select group of Russian (and Russian-allied) operators and has seen combat action against Chechen forces - particularly against enemy snipers in the \"counter-sniper\" role.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "fe004cc6-5e32-457e-853b-8d0c3e03c1f3", "year_model": "1951", "weapon_name": "Makarov PM (Pistol Marakova)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Makarov PM (\"Pistolet Makarova\") was designed and developed to replace the Soviet World War 2-era Tokarev TT-33 series semi-automatic pistol. The PM was based on the excellent qualities of the German Walther PP, a family of blow-back operated pistols appearing in 1935 and seeing extensive action throughout World War 2. The type proved of such a most excellent design that it led to both legal and illegal production copies of the type in the decades following its introduction. The Makarov PM was one such illegal copy and entered service in 1951. Despite its 1950s origins, it can still be found in the active Russian inventory as well as in use with other armies worldwide.\n\r\nDesign of the PM was attributed to none other than Nikolay Makarov, a firearms engineer having graduated from the Tula State University. Makarov would go on to claim designs leading to the operational acceptance of the AM-23 cannon, the 9K111 \"Fagot\" man-portable missile launcher and the 9M113 \"Konkurs\" wire-guided missile. However, the Makarov PM would be his first true claim to fame for the Soviet Army. Production of his PM pistol would be handled in the Soviet Union by Izhevsk Mechanical Factory.\n\r\nA design competition was held by Soviet authorities looking to replace the outgoing TT-33 series pistol. Makarov selected the Walther 9mm Ultra round as his starting point and developed his gun around it. The ammunition in the Soviet inventory would take the applicable name of \"9x18mm Makarov\". The 9mm Makarov was similar in some respects to the 9mm Short cartridge with featured a longer casing. This produced a pistol cartridge that proved shorter than the 9mm Parabellum and made for a very unique - if decidedly Soviet - cartridge design overall. This allowed the some level of protection in ensuring that the pistol could only work with Soviet \"in-house\" ammunition and could not be used in numbers against their original owners in a time of full scale war. In the end, the 9mm Makarov was essentially the largest cartridge size applicable to safely firing from the blowback operation system.\n\r\nDesign of the receiver was nothing more than simply following the lines of the original Walther PP pistol but to a slightly larger scale. The pistol measured in at 160mm with a 98mm barrel assembly featuring four grooves and a right-hand twist. The magazine was a spring-loaded 8-round detachable box that was conventionally inserted in through the bottom of the hand grip. Muzzle velocity was rated at 1,070 feet per second and the firing operation was, of course, blowback in nature. The trigger system offered both double-action and single-action operation and effective range was listed out to 50 meters. Some specialized models were later equipped with magazine counts of 10- and 12-rounds. Sighting was accomplished by way of a bladed front and an adjustable notch rear sight. Overall, the PM exhibited very well-countered and clean lines throughout, featuring some vertical ribbing near the main portion of the receiver. The trigger was curved forward and protected in an oblong trigger ring. Safety and other pertinent mechanical functions were set along the left side of the receiver within reach of the operator's thumb. The slide featured slab sides and nicely curved upper and lower surfaces. The rounded hammer spur protruded from the rear of the receiver ever so slightly but was still noticeable. The ejection port was fitted along the right side of the receiver, launching spent shell casings upwards and away from the operator.\n\r\nThe operator initiated the firing action by pulling back on the slide to cock the hammer and introduce a fresh cartridge into the firing chamber. Semi-automatic action occurred after the firing of each round as the pistol was automatically recocked and the chamber reloaded with a fresh cartridge. The operator could then let-off as many rounds as were available. Upon emptying of the magazine, the slide locked open for prevention of subsequent firing and to visibly inform the operator that a reload was required. The empty magazine was released via a release lever at the base of the pistol grip.\n\r\nThe Makarov PM was revised to become the Makarov PMM in 1990. This version elevated the muzzle velocity of the original action. The hand grip was modified for better ergonomics and the firing chamber saw grooves added. A 12-round magazine was also introduced.\n\r\nBeyond manufacture of the gun by IMF, the PM was produced to foreign markets by notable licensed  contributors Ernst Thaelmann / Simson (Suhl) of Germany, Arsenal of Bulgaria and NORINCO of China. Notable operators would go on to include Afghanistan, China (as the Type 59 of 1959), Cuba, East Germany, Georgia, Iraq, Laos, North Korea, Poland, Syria and Ukraine among others.\n\r\nCivilian market versions of the PM soon appeared and similar versions made their way out of both Hungary and Poland. When the Berlin Wall fell in Germany, the unified country had thousands of existing Makarov PM pistols to manage from the joining East German military and security forces.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ffe7ffc2-a572-423a-9392-e004cae07485", "year_model": "1965", "weapon_name": "MON-50", "weapon_type": "Anti-Personnel (AP) Fragmentation Mine", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MON-50 serves the Russian Army, and many other global operators, as an infantry-level Anti-Personnel (AP) mine.

It succeeded the ages-old Makarov pistol as standard issue. Criticized for its all-steel construction (adding to its overall weight) and general reliability when compared to proven products like Glock, the MP-443 is nonetheless a powerful handgun and most notable for its firing of an armor-piercing, body-armor-defeating cartridge. During its trial phase, the MP-443 was designated as the \"6P35\". It has since been known as the \"PYa\" as well.\n\r\nThe sidearm is manufactured out of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant and its design stems from Vladimir Yarygin.\n\r\nOrigins of the Grach stem from a 1993 Russian military requirement seeking to replace the limited-capacity Makarov series pistol which saw widespread adoption by military, governmental, special forces and police units. The requirement called for a Double-Action (DA) trigger system and a high-capacity 17-round magazine (an 18-round magazine was introduced in 2004). The all-steel construction was part of the original makeup of the gun and chamberings requested included 9x19mm Parabellum, 9x18mm Makarov and 7.62x25mm Tokarev. The MP-443 followed through on these qualities and settled on the 9x19mm 7N21 +P+ (a 9mm NATO equivalent) pistol cartridge as its primary round.\n\r\nThe action used is the short-recoil (with locked breech) arrangement and sights are fixed out to 50 meters. The sighting combination pairs a front blade with 3-dot reach notch, all fixed. All other mechanical functions of the sidearm are conventional with the slide lock, safety and magazine release all located in their usual positions along the frame of the gun. Magazines are inserted into the base of the grip handle in the usual way.\n\r\nIntroduction of the MP-443 series was agonizingly slow and first occurred with specialist Russian troops around 2008. Serious quantitative production was seen in 2011 leading to increased widespread service of the pistol from 2012 onward.\n\r\nSince its formal introduction, the MP-443 has seen several civilian-market developments appear lead by the MP-446 \"Viking\" model.  This maintains much of the form and function of the military version but does not support firing of armor-piercing cartridges. The MP-446C is an offshoot with a 10-round magazine limit. The MP-353 fires rubber bullets and is classified as a \"non-lethal\" pistol. The MP-472 follows suit as a non-lethal pistol development.\n\r\nBeyond Russia, the Grach pistol line has been adopted by private firms in Kazakhstan (2007).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "af1d2269-4fa0-4073-852c-d9de673c76e1", "year_model": "1971", "weapon_name": "NSV HMG (Utes / Utjos)", "weapon_type": "Heavy Machine Gun / Vehicle Gun", "description": "\r\n        \tFor a time, the NSV multi-purpose heavy machine gun was the standard heavy machine gun of Soviet Army forces. The system was adopted in 1971 to specifically replace the long-running DShK/DShKM series  which debuted just prior to World War 2 (1939-1945) in 1938. Despite adopting the newer design, the breakup of the Soviet Union during the late 1980s/early 1990s meant that the NSV production facilities (and applicable license rights) fell within Kazakhstan territory which essentially signaled the end for the NSV in Russian Army service. Instead, the Russian Army selected the Kord 12.7mm series in its place. Regardless, the NSV continues in Russian Army service (though being replaced with the newer Kord line when possible) while license production of the NVS has been undertaken in Bulgaria, India, Poland, Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia (now Serbia) - ensuring that it remain in circulation for some time to come.\n\r\nThe NSV is chambered for the large 12.7x108mm cartridge, a cartridge capable of piercing light armor protection and literally annihilating a human target to unidentifiable pieces. Such a weapon requires specific tolerances and this, in turn, adds bulk and weight - restricting the weapon to a largely defensive role when mounted onto a heavy duty tripod. If intended for offense - say fixed atop a trainable mounting on a vehicle, watercraft or helicopter as a vehicle gun, the weapon is given more flexibility and mobility. The gun unit alone weighs a hefty 55lb with a 50-round belt adding 25lb. The tripod assembly tips the scales at 90lb which, all told, the complete system can reach weights of 170lb.\n\r\nThe NSV relies on a tried and true gas-operated action in which the arrangement taps gasses of the fired cartridge and channels this into a gas cylinder under the barrel. This pressure, in turn, ingeniously drives the action held within at the receiver, ejecting a spent shell casing while injecting a fresh cartridge. Basically, the fired shot provides the necessary movement and forces required of the successive shot. The weapon is therefore restricted to full-automatic fire meaning that a squeeze of the trigger will result in a consistent intake of ammunition (and firing of bullets from the muzzle) so long as ammunition supplies allow and the trigger remains held down. The weapon is given a rate-of-fire between 700 and 800 rounds per minute which, as an air-cooled weapon, the operator need be aware of barrel overheating. Muzzle velocity is a functional 2,770 feet per second which provides the necessary penetration at range - effective range being approximately 6,500 feet against ground targets (such as an enemy vehicle). The weapon can engage both ground and aerial targets - range against aerial targets limited to about 5,000 feet. For anti-aircraft defense, the weapon can be mounted onto vehicles (such as a tank's turret roof) or on a tripod for a more portable, infantry-level defensive product.\n\r\nThe weapon takes on a conventional appearance with its oversized receiver. Ammunition is fed via 50-round belt from a hardened case affixed to the right side of the receiver. Spent casings a ejected at the left of the receiver. The barrel is unfluted as well as unjacketed though capped by a massive slotted muzzle brake to help content with some of the violent recoil forces at play. The gas cylinder is fitted under the barrel in a rather traditional way. Sighting is through an iron arrangement though the weapon has been coupled to various optical arrangements, particularly when in the anti-aircraft role - though this is largely dependent on the national army in question.\n\r\nBeyond its use in the Russian/Soviet Army, the weapon has also seen acceptance within the inventories of Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland (as the \"12.7 ltkk 96\"), Georgia, India (produced by the Ordnance Factory at Tiruchirappalli), Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Macedonia, Mauritius, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland (as the \"WKM-B\" though in 0.50 BMG form), Serbia (as the \"M87 NSVT\", a vehicle gun by Zastava Arms), Slovenia and Vietnam.\n\r\nSuch a reach has meant that the weapon has gone on to see consistent frontline service in several high-profile wars and regional conflicts including the 1980s Soviet-Afghan War, 1991 Gulf War and the 2001 and 2003 US-led invasions spawning Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "bbebfb54-5df5-4d48-8d9a-0bffbfd6fffd", "year_model": "2011", "weapon_name": "ORSIS T-5000", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian SV-98 sniper was brought about to replace the ages-old SVD series in some Russian agencies. While the SVD series proved a capable long-range sniping platform in its own right, it still maintained origins well-laid in the Cold War years. What modern Russia needed now was a more modern system taking into account the changing face of warfare, Russian doctrine in the post-Cold War world and technological advancements. Thusly, the SV-98 sniper rifle was born.\n\r\nDesign of the SV-98 - under the direction of Vladimir Stronskiy, began in 1998. The design was based on the Izhmash Record-CISM series. After a period of evaluation, serial production followed and was undertaken out of the Izhmash OJSC facilities with service entry of the weapon into the inventories of the Russian special forces - including Spetsnaz- and some police units in 1998.\n\r\nOutwardly, the SV-98 attains a most conventional appearance as sniper rifles go.

The anti-personnel mine falls under this description, designed to maim or outright kill through its detonation, the blast effect or fragments proven utterly lethal against those unfortunate enough to be within its zone. Despite an international effort to ban such battlefield measures since 1997, the anti-personnel mine continues to see widespread use in warfare today (2023).\n\r\nDuring the Cold War between East and West, the Soviets developed a new generation of anti-personnel mine which became the \"PFM-1\" - no doubt influenced by the American Army's BLU-43 \"Dragontooth\" anti-personnel mine series used in Laos during Operation Igloo White as part of the Vietnam War (1965-1975). This winged, plastic-bodied device was designed as a cost-effective solution that could be set by ground forces or air-dropped via aircraft / helicopter through cassette containers - the \"winged\" design of the mine helping to retard the mine's fall.\n\r\nThe mine's design is wholly utilitarian by nature, intended to be produced in quantity as cheaply as possible while promoting the most \"value\" as an anti-personnel solution. Arming is by way of safety pin removal to which a spring in actuated until contacting the detonator component - detonation being handled by any external changes to the exterior plastic body of the mine making it extremely sensitive even for trained handlers. Disarming is impossible.\n\r\nPFM-1 marked the original production models which arrived in a very identifiable green coloring - the coloring meant for better concealment on the expected European battlefields of the Cold War period. The PFM-1S followed as a variant. Initial use was in the Soviet-Afghan War where the mine's green bodies were easily noticeable against the dry, desert environment of the Afghan battlefield.\n\r\nThe sheer quantity of mines produced has ensured their place even in the modern Russian inventory - where forces have taken to its use (alongside other design types) in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War (2022-Present).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "58966b26-6e28-4248-9a62-f6abfb1f95e6", "year_model": "2001", "weapon_name": "PKP Pecheneg (6P41)", "weapon_type": "General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tIn 1961, the Soviet Army began wide-scale adoption of the PK General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) which utilized the tried-and-true 7.62mm Russian rifle cartridge through a belt-fed mechanism and gas-operated system. It was adopted beyond the Soviet realm by political and military allies to become a permanent, and rather lethal, fixture in the wars to follow - Vietnam, Yom Kippur, Iran-Iraq, the Chechen wars among others. Amazingly, the PK family line has withstood the test of time to remain in wide-reaching use today and has since been modernized through the \"PKM\" form.\n\r\nAt the turn of the century, the Russian military began evaluation of a new, modernized machine gun form intended to serve in the squad-level role. As such, the design would become highly portable and intended for true suppression effect. The design was headed by TsNIITochMash and the weapon came to be known as the PKP \"Pecheneg\". It was then formally adopted for frontline use in 2001. Granted the military designation of 6P41, it has since seen service with the Russian Army and SPETSNAZ special forces while adopted in varying degrees by Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\r\nAt its core, the PKP remains a gas-operated machine gun system capable of full-automatic fire while being fed by way of 100-, 200- or 250-round belt magazines held in a hard box under the receiver. It retains use of the same 7.62x54R cartridge seen in the PK/PKM and features a rate-of-fire reaching 600 to 800 rounds-per-minute. Muzzle velocity is 2,700 feet per second while effective firing ranges reach out to 1,500 meters.\n\r\nOutwardly, the PKP showcases a workmanlike appearance with a solid, rectangular receiver in an all-black finish. The receiver naturally houses the critical internal working components of the action including the feed mechanism and firing chamber. There is a lightweight, skeletal stock for support at the shoulder and the barrel sits above the gas cylinder at front. Iron sights are provided though optics can be affixed as required. An integrated carrying handle is useful for quick relocation of the unit. A standard fixture at the barrel is a folding bipod assembly. Sling loops allow a shoulder strap to be used which is a must for quick-moving infantry. An ergonomic pistol grip handle and easy-reach trigger group provide a familiar operational functionality to the weapon. Unlike other GPMGs, the PKP does not feature a \"quick-change\" barrel facility for in-the-field management of a hot barrel. Instead, the assembly is designed with a forced-air, air-cooled arrangement.\n\r\nOverall weight of the PKP (with its bipod affixed) is approximately 8.7 kilograms. It features an overall length of 47 inches while the barrel assembly measures some 26 inches long. When affixed with a night vision device, the 6P41 becomes known as the \"6P41N Pecheneg-N\". Other designations include the Pecheneg \"Bullpup\" which is a reworked form to the bullpup configuration, retaining its full-length barrel and containing the action/magazine feed to the rear of the trigger group. The Pecheneg-2 is considered an \"improved\" based on the original Pecheneg model and is currently (2014) in the development phase.\n\r\nThe PKP has recently seen combat actions in the Russian takeover of Crimea by Army and special forces elements.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "47ccdc05-ac82-4231-97e1-92a710fbdf57", "year_model": "2022", "weapon_name": "PPSH Labs LPD-801", "weapon_type": "Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe LPD-801 is a Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) designed, developed, and manufactured by Russia.

Design of the weapon is attributed to TsKIB SOO and production is ongoing as of this writing (February 2014).\n\r\nAt its core, the RG-6 is a semi-automatic weapon chambered for the special caseless 40mm VOG-25 series grenade - the same as featured in the standard-issue GL-25 underslung assault rifle launcher (detailed elsewhere on this site). The RG-6 sports a Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger set with enlarged loop to support a gloved hand and can sustain a rate-of-fire up to 18 rounds per minute. Grenades are housed in a six-shot rotating cylinder which swings out for reloading. Unlike Western repeat-fire grenade launchers (which load through the breech end) , the RG-6 is loaded through the muzzle end of the cylinder chambers. A spring used to rotate the cylinder is then manually wound prior to firing. Another unique facet of the cylinder's design is that each chamber is rifled and the barrel left as smoothbore. Thusly, the chambers themselves impart the necessary rotation upon the exiting projectile (as opposed to the barrel). \r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d8efb722-4c4d-4b7f-bb0a-9e5a6643aec2", "year_model": "1990", "weapon_name": "RGN (Ruchnaya Granata Nastupatelnaya)", "weapon_type": "Fragmentation Hand Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RGN (\"Ruchnaya Granata Nastupatel'naya\") is a basic, standardized fragmentation hand grenade of Soviet origin.

It is a largely conventional semi-automatic pistol constructed of composites and metal with an integral trigger ring, over-receiver slide, and pistol grip magazine well. It entered notable service in 2004 and has seen combat exposure in the current War in Donbass against Russian elements and separatists.\n\r\nThe gun is manufactured locally by state-owned RPC Fort, founded in 1991 and headquartered in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. Production is ongoing as of this writing (2020).\n\r\nThe pistol is typically seen and operated through the widely-available 9mm chambering, a proven man-stopped the world over and making for a more manageable sidearm in terms of accuracy. The internal action is of Double-Action (DA), semi-automatic function, allowing one pull/squeeze of the trigger to fire the gun and introduce a new cartridge into the chamber while ejecting the spent case. During this quick action, the slide is managed rearwards and resets over the receiver in the usual way. Feeding is by way of a 13-round spring-loaded detachable box magazine fitted into the hollowed out grip. Muzzle velocity is rated at 325 meters-per-second. Overall length reaches 180mm with the barrel measuring 95mm. Weight is 810 grams loaded (680 grams otherwise).\n\r\nSights are set over the receiver, one component at the rear and the other nearer the muzzle for approximate placement of the bullet at range. The slide features ribbing along its sides for a surer grip when managing the slide assembly manually (such as in the initial cocking action). A safety mechanism is set at the slide towards the rear (near the thumb) and the exposed hammer protrudes from the rear of the assembly. The magazine-release button is situated near the trigger, giving quick access to the system for reloading, while the trigger itself sits within an uninterrupted ring which is oversized to accommodate a gloved hand. The grip's backstrap is removable/replaceable for some customization of the pistol.\n\r\nThe Fort-17 family line currently (2020) includes the base design as the \"Fort-17\". This model is chambered in the 9x18mm PM (Makarov) pistol cartridge. The Fort-17 Curz uses the 9mm \"Kurz\" (.380 ACP) cartridge while the \"Kobra\" is a sport shooter utilizing the Makarov catridge. The \"Kordon\" follows as another sporting entry but chambered in .22 Long Rifle and firing from a 10-round detachable box magazine. The Fort-17R and Fprt-17T are ant-riot variants firing rubber bullets for crowd control.\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs is the largest global operator of this pistol series. Fewer numbers have also been sold to local police forces and security elements. In 2014, the series was officially taken on by the Ukrainian Army.\n\r\nDespite Ukraine being at war with Russia,the Fort-17 made its way to Russia prior to the War in Donbass as it was openly exported until the middle of 2011. As such, some of these pistols have been used against the host country during the fighting that remains ongoing.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a4ade21d-b3c8-4170-92a8-7bc070d9ee18", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "RPG-22 (Netto)", "weapon_type": "Disposable, Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tIn the East, the Rocket-Propelled Grenade (\"RPG\") weapon system has seen consistent evolution and battlefield use since the original RPG-2 made its debut in 1954. These relatively simplistic weapons have proven both easy to train with and easy to operate meaning any able-bodied person can be made lethal in its use. The weapons are an economic measure that is ideal against enemy armor, light vehicles, and fortified enemy positions. The RPG line grew out of the Cold War period (1947-1991) with the original RPG-2 and went on to produce the classic RPG-7 and modern incarnations in the RPG-18 \"Mukha\", RPG-22 \"Netto\", and RPG-29 \"Vampir\".\n\r\nThe RPG-22, the focus of this article, was evolved from the earlier RPG-18 and appeared in 1985 as the Soviets were embroiled in their war in Afghanistan. As with other Soviet-era weapons, this system has managed to remain a viable solution on the modern battlefield - even today. In both form and function, the RPG-22 is comparable to the American M72 LAW (detailed elsewhere on this site) and, like the M72, the Soviet model is disposable after firing, limiting it to single-use functionality.\n\r\nThe RPG-22 fires a High-Explosive, Anti-Tank (HEAT) round by way of a 72.5mm projectile out to ranges of 200 meters. Maximum range is 250 meters as the sighting device is pre-marked at stages for ranging out to 50m, 150m, and 250m. The weapon is rated against Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA), concrete, and brick targets making it an ideal multi-purpose weapon. Furthermore, its lightweight (2.8kg) and compact footprint (785mm collapsed, 850mm extended) means that it can be carried over the shoulder of each infantryman or a single infantryman can carry multiple tubes ready-to-fire. The launcher is readied in seconds with the tube extended, flip-up sights engaged, and the trigger pulled. As the exiting projectile is inherently unguided (simply stabilized by spring-loaded fins), the rocket is prone to accuracy issues the farther out the target resides. Cocking the weapon is done by simply raising the rear sight, the operator needing only to lower the sight to de-cock.\n\r\nThe launch tube if of weight-savings fiberglass construction and, internally, it has a smoothbore design housing the rocket grenade. Caps are affixed at both ends of the launch tube when in transport and the telescoping section of tube slides over the fixed, primary cylindrical assembly making up the launcher.\n\r\nAs with any shoulder-fired weapon of this type, the launch tube exhausts its propellant directly aft of the operator meaning anything in the back-blast is in danger. As such, this limits the weapon's usage some when firing from cover such as from a building's window. Once fired, the launch tube is discarded allowing the infantryman to freely move with less weight to carry.\n\r\nDespite its age, the RPG-22 series continues active use with the armed forces of Russia as well as many former Soviet allies, supported states, and aligned export customers including Bulgaria (including local production), Croatia, Georgia, India, Iraq, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.\n\r\nIt has more recently seen use in the Ukrainian-Russian War of 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "5d671209-b154-4b64-8da4-bd4e14d4f3e4", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "RPG-26", "weapon_type": "Disposable Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPG-26 (Rocket Propelled Grenade 26) was developed as a single-shot, disposable anti-tank battlefield solution for the Red Army during the Cold War. The weapon consisted of a non-descript cylindrical launch tube housing the 72.5mm anti-armor rocket within. The rocket was designed with spring-actuated stabilizing fins that emerged once the rocket cleared the launch tube upon firing. Penetration was made possible by the shaped-charge warhead to which some 440mm of armor thickness could be penetrated at effective ranges within 250 meters. In addition to its anti-armor function, the weapon could also be used to engage fortified structures as required. Overall length of the launch system was 770mm while overall weight was 2.9 kilograms.\n\r\nThe RShG-2 was a variant of the base RPG-26 system and utilized the same form and function as the original design. However, the rocket fitted a thermobaric warhead and the complete system weighed in at 3.5 kilograms. This solution also fielded a much more limited range, its effectiveness being limited to targets within 115 meters.\n\r\nIn all, the RPG-26 family of anti-tank solutions was comparable to the American M72 LAW, another disposable anti-tank weapon system utilizing a spring-loaded fin-stabilized 66mm rocket fielded in large numbers by the West during the Cold War.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "5b7a17b9-83f1-4fef-ba43-0d845c036123", "year_model": "1989", "weapon_name": "RPG-27 (Tavolga)", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Rocket-Propelled Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \tWorld War 2 (1939-1945) solidified the tank as a core component of land warfare. In turn, this gave rise to counter-tank solutions that coincided with advancements in rocketry and portability of systems centered on armor-defeating weapons such as the German \"Panzerfaust\" and American \"BAZOOKA\" series (both detailed elsewhere on this site). As the Cold War between East and West settled into a relatively stalemate following the close of the Second World War, both sides continued development of tank-killing measures with the Soviets developing a whole line of \"RPG\" (Rocket-Propelled Grenade) man-portable weapons.\n\r\nIn the late 1980s, the RPG-27 (\"Tavolga\" = \"Grassy Meadow\") became the latest addition to the family line that began with the RPG-2 of 1954. While the RPG-2 utilized a reusable launch tube, there was a subgroup of Anti-Tank (AT) weapons that relied on the single-shot approach with a disposable tube. In this manner, the operator could carry several of the weapons (typically three) into combat and \"lighten the load\" as the battle progressed. Examples of this form were the RPG-18, RPG-22, RPG-26, and - the focus of this article - the RPG-27.\n\r\nThe man-portable disposable weapon was a technically sound battlefield solution. It involved a two-piece launch tube that could collapse on itself for ease-of-transport (with the ready rocket already inside) and was extended to the fullest when made ready-to-fire. Aiming could be done either through iron sights or optics if integrated depending on the design. The result was an AT measure that, if the rocket's warhead allowed, could repel any modern tank of the day. In the West, this role eventually fell to the M72 \"Light Anti-tank Weapon\" - or \"LAW\" among other tank-killers.\n\r\nOriginating as an evolved form of the earlier RPG-26 series, the larger-diameter RPG-27 centered on a fin-stabilized, rocket-propelled projectile (tandem-charge HEAT warhead) of 105mm caliber and rated against Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) (750mm), Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) blocks (add-on armor protection), concrete / fortified (1,500mm), and earth (3,700mm). The rockets reached a muzzle velocity of 120 meters-per-second when exiting the launch tube and effective range was out to 200 meters with aiming handled by way of iron sights (as such, accuracy was reduced the further away the target was). Overall weight of the complete unit was 7.6 kilograms with an overall, extended length of 1,155mm.\n\r\nThe RPG-27 saw design work take place during the 1980s under the direction of the State Research and Production Enterprise (Bazalt) and production - along with service entry into the Soviet inventory - began in 1989. In time, variants included the thermobaric warhead \"RShG-1\" (\"Reaktivnaya Shturmovaya Granata\") for lighter-armored targets and the multirole, bunker-busting \"RMG\" (\"Reaktivnaya Mnogotselevaya\") offshoots.\n\r\nDespite its lengthy battlefield career, the RPG-27 could only ever count the Soviet Union and ally Jordan as its global operators. The in-service stocks of launchers then fell to the reborn Russian Army with the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1989-1991.\n\r\nIt is believed that the RPG-27 has been actively used by Russian forces in its was against neighboring Ukraine following Russia's invasion of February 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "55b0e110-50f3-4500-bebd-44f184c5560e", "year_model": "2011", "weapon_name": "RPG-28 Klyukva (Cranberry)", "weapon_type": "Shoulder-Fired Disposable Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tPortable, shoulder-fired armor-defeating weapons have been a staple of Russian military units since the dark days of World War 2 (1939-1945).

These weapon systems have proven utterly reliable, effective and easy-to-operate / train on, making them a popular choice for guerilla fighters able to get their hands on the weapons.\n\r\nThe RPG-28 fits this same mold - it is a shoulder-fired weapon designed to be carried and fired by a single individual with effectiveness against armored targets and fortified positions. The launcher unit sports integrated optics for sighting targets at range and is wholly disposable once the rocket has been fired. It can be carried by a single infantryman or mounted on a tripod assembly for ambushing passing armor.

However, the RPG-32 makes use of a reusable launch tube firing a 105mm rocket grenade as opposed to the disposable nature of the RPG-30 series.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a5fef374-765f-485d-b428-6ddaf0fddb43", "year_model": "2008", "weapon_name": "RPG-32 (Hashim)", "weapon_type": "72mm/105mm Rocket Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tAt the start of the new millennium, the governments of Jordan and Mexico commissioned the Russian government-run bureau of Bazalt to design and develop a modern armor-defeating, anti-tank measure with penetration capabilities against reinforced concrete targets. The result was the \"RPG-32\" based on the existing RPG-29. Russia has long held an expertise with inexpensive anti-tank devices going as far back as World War 2 during their bloody conflict with Germany and the Axis powers. The RPG-32 became, in many ways, a culmination of the many successes of previous designs which included the world-renowned RPG-7 (which Bazalt continues to produce). The RPG-32 entered service in 2008 and is utilized by the armies of Iraq, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The \"Hashim\" designator sometimes seen is applied by the Jordanian Army in reference to the Arab Hashemite dynasty of centuries past. Jordan supplied initial financing of the RPG-32 initiative and its engineers played a role in the final design.\n\r\nAt its core, the RPG-32 is a rocket-propelled grenade launcher in much the same vein as the RPG-7 before it though featuring a much lighter launcher and more capable rocket element. The system consists of the launch tube which, in itself, integrates the optics and trigger mechanism. The rocket grenade is provided through a pre-fabricated casing that is inserted at the rear of the tube prior to firing. The optical sight is managed from the left side of the launch tube with the trigger unit along the right. As with the earlier RPG developments, little preparation is required to make the RPG-32 ready and little training is required in its use - making it popular amongst many operators. The RPG-32 launcher is of 105mm caliber though it can fire from an ammunition stock of both 105mm (15.4lbs) and 72mm rocket types. There are two recognized rockets available - the \"PG-32V\" tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) and the \"TBG-32V\" Thermobaric Fragmentation Anti-Armor (TFAA). The former is listed with a penetration up to 650mm (25 inches) and a muzzle velocity of 460 feet per second with an effective range out to 2,300 feet. Rockets are delivered from the factory in a disposable case which is affixed to the rear of the reusable launch tube.\n\r\nThe RPG-32 is said to be capable of defeating the base armor of present-day Main Battle Tanks while the warhead is suitable against other target types including fortified structures. The launcher is purposely designed to be man-portable and is fired from the shoulder in the usual way. Firing from within buildings is, of course, restricted to an extent due to the violent back-blast of such weapons in confined spaces. Launchers weigh 3 kilograms (sans projectile) and their value is limited only by the ammunition supply on hand. Common practice is an RPG carrier with 3 x rocket grenades in a specially-devised backpack alongside his primary automatic weapon. As the projectile is a true \"rocket grenade\" and not a homing/guided missile, the projectile is essentially a \"point-and-shoot\" weapon without any guidance provided to the rocket after launch. This helps to keep procurement costs down substantially while providing for a very modern armor-penetrating system for discerning customers. According to company sources, a single launcher is rated for the firing of 200 rockets.\n\r\nIt is believed that local license production of the launchers and rockets are handled in Argentina, Brazil, Jordan and Mexico. Such manufacture of a local solution was one of the initial project goals concerning the RPG-32.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d4b0958c-aba2-491b-942a-b8221fbe5a98", "year_model": "1961", "weapon_name": "RPG-7", "weapon_type": "Rocket-Propelled Grenade (RPG) Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPG-7 (\"Ruchnoy Protivotankoviy Granatomet\") was the follow-up in the family of Soviet-originated \"RPG\" man-portable, shoulder-fired, anti-tank rocket launchers (generically referred to as \"RPGs\"). The Soviet design could trace its roots back to the American \"Bazooka\" and German \"Panzerfaust' launchers of World War 2 and many examples of these weapons came into the hands of Soviet troopers throughout the conflict. The RPG-7, like those rocket projecting systems before it, was devised as an inexpensive and easy-to-produce and operate, one-man, single-shot weapon for the purpose of defeating armor at range. Despite its 1961 introduction, the system maintains a faithful following and its production reach has meant that the weapon continues to see frontline service in a plethora of modern conflicts. Its qualities are such that the series is a favorite of organized national armies as well as rebels and guerrilla fighters the world over.\n\r\nThe RPG-7 is a further development of past RPG variations - from the earlier RPG-2, RPG-3 and RPG-4 rocket projectors - and can fire a variety of warhead types including FRAG (FRAGmentation), HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) and HE (High-Explosive) rounds. The FRAG projectile is a 4lb munition relying on 210 grams of A-IX-1 explosive. There are two major HEAT projectiles in the PG-7VL single-stage and PG-7VR tandem charge. The former weighs 5.7lb and the latter 9.9lb. Diameter is 93mm and 64mm respectively and these munitions can penetrade between 500mm and 750mm of Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA). The TBG-7V is a thermobaric projectile of 9.9lb weight with a listed caliber of 105mm.\n\r\nOverall weight of the weapon is 15lb and overall length is 950mm (37.4 inches) making the system both lightweight and compact to carry. Grenades leave the muzzle at 115 meters per second and effective ranges are out to 200 meters (maximum achievable range is 920 meters). Sighting is through traditional static iron sights but optics are also supported as is a red dot reflex sighting device. At about 50 meters, the operator can achieve hit probability as high as 100% though this drops to half that at about 200 meters away from the target (of course many factors influence accuracy). Its effectiveness is not necessarily in the ability to stop light-armored vehicles but also to provide shock value to dug-in enemy troops.\n\r\nThe RPG-7 is an inherently compact weapon and paratrooper versions are designed to be broken down into major components for better travel. It provides generally lightly-armed troopers with necessary firepower to stop vehicles on approach or unseat defenders. The resulting \"back blast\" of the firing rocket is relatively minimal and this allows the RPG to be fired from enclosed spaces such as buildings and from covered outdoor positions. Its operation is also quite basic, requiring little training on the part of the user, which lends itself well to rebel forces and other less-organized fighters. Despite its sheer simplicity, the influence of the RPG-7 on the battlefield cannot be overstated.\n\r\nThe modern Russian Army relies on the modernized form of the weapon as the \"RPG-7V2\" and its paratrooper counterpart is the \"RPG-7D3\".\n\r\nOver 9,000,000 examples of the RPG-7 have been produced since 1961 by Bazalt, Degtyarev and others. It is locally manufactured in no fewer than a dozen countries and can be found in the military inventories of nearly forty nations worldwide - from Afghanistan and Albania to Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Chinese version is designated \"Type 69\" and Vietnam knows it as the \"B-41\". For Sudan, the weapon is the \"Sinar\" and is produced by the Military Industry Corporation. Bulgaria designates their stock as \"ATGL-L\".\n\r\nAirtronic of the United States fabricates the weapon as the \"RPG-7USA\" and this is a modern incarnation of the weapon complete with accessories rail, flip-up sights, and extended service life.\n\r\nFormer operators include East Germany, Rhodesia, and Yugoslavia. Comparable weapon systems in the West are the American M72 LAW, German Panzerfaust 3, and Israeli B-300.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d1f69f81-e0f9-4f41-9547-930a64e07c52", "year_model": "1974", "weapon_name": "SA-14 (Gremlin) / 9K34 Strela-3", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile", "description": "\r\n        \tDue to the limited capabilities of its preceding 9K32 \"Strela-2\" (NATO: SA-7 \"Grail\") anti-aircraft missile system, the Soviet military commissioned for an improved form which became the 9K34 \"Strela-3\" (NATO: SA-14 \"Gremlin\").  The missile was given more reliable infrared homing seeker which made it less prone to fall for launched countermeasures by aircraft. The system was produced by KBM and introduced into the Soviet Army inventory in 1974. Despite its Cold War origins, the weapon continues widespread use today, proving an effective battlefield man-portable, shoulder-launched system. A navalized form has been recognized by NATO as the \"SA-N-8\".\n\r\nThe 9K34 followed along the same design lines as previous man-portable, shoulder-launched offerings. The system consisted of a slim launch tube with attached powerpack, trigger group and grip and optics. The missile resided in the launch tube until firing to which it would break free of its hold and head for the target at Mach speeds, spring-loaded fins providing the necessary stabilization and course correction. Overall length of the launch tube was just under five feet. The missile (heavier than the Strela-2 before it) maintained a speed of up to 1,500 kilometers per hour and could reach targets as high as 7,500 feet with accuracy (accuracy improved considerably at lower altitudes. Upon impact, the Strela-3 missile could do enough damage to critical components to take an aircraft down. The Strela-3 could also engage aircraft from the front and sides with some success.\n\r\nThe 9K34 system has seen extensive service in armies worldwide since its inception. It was fielded by Iraqi forces during the 1991 Gulf War which saw a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Panavia Tornado brought down by the type. The weapon has also seen use in the Georgian-Russian engagements as well as the Bosnia War. The 9K34 has also proven prevalent across many localized operations on the African continent where access to Soviet goods has always proven easy. One of the most recognized instances of a 9K34 missile engaging an aircraft was on November 22nd, 2003 when a DHL Airbus A300 cargo aircraft was damaged by a Streola-3 missile shortly after taking-off from Baghdad International Airport. While damaged along the trailing edge of its portside wing and loss of hydraulic power, the aircraft managed to circle back and land safely for assessment and repair.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "19d6ea83-557a-4815-bcb2-bc1d89946dd8", "year_model": "1981", "weapon_name": "SA-16 (Gimlet) / 9K310 Igla-1", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9K310 \"Igla-1\" (NATO: SA-16 \"Gimlet\") was designed, developed and produced alongside the improved, and technologically superior, 9K38 \"Igla\" (NATO: SA-18 \"Grouse\") man-portable, shoulder-launched anti-aircraft system. Both series entered service with the Soviet Army in 1983 and continue widespread use today (2013).

The primary limitation of the preceding series was their consistent unreliability particularly when facing aircraft countermeasures. As the new program developed, it was decided to produce two distinct missile forms - a short-term, improved solution in the 9K310 and the longer-term, more advanced 9K38. The 9K310 was assigned the Igla-1 missile system with sported an improved homing and guidance suite.\n\r\nThe 9K310 inherited the same form and function of preceding Soviet anti-aircraft missile launching marks.

The Igla-1 was the base missile designation while the Igla-1M was an improved form of the late 1980s. The Igla-1D was a more compact variant intended for airborne infantry while the Igla-1N featured a more potent warhead.

The weapon was adopted by the Soviet military in 1983 and retained by the modern Russian military after the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991. The SA-18 is classified a short-to-medium-range anti-aircraft counter for threats posed by low-flying aircraft such as fixed-wing strike platforms and attack helicopters. Production of the weapon is handled through the KBM bureau of Kolomna, Russia.\n\r\nDesign origins of the SA-18 can be traced back to an early 1970s initiative intended on producing a modern, more effective and portable anti-aircraft measure for the Soviet Army beyond the scope of theexisting SA-7 and SA-14 systems then in use. The program eventually evolved into two distinct product goals which produced the interim-minded (and technologically simpler) 9K310 \"Igla-1\" (NATO: \"SA-16\") and the more advanced 9K38 \"Igla\" (NATO: \"SA-18\"). The SA-18 launcher appeared as a follow-up to the SA-14 family though with an all-new missile development. The overall design of the weapon was conventional, including a sleek tubular launch tube which was set over the operator's shoulder when fired. When transported, the system was afforded a shoulder strap. The powerpack, trigger unit with pistol grip and optics are all contained at the frontal section of the launcher. \n\r\nThe SA-18 was adopted into Red Army service in 1983 (the SA-16 in 1981). A major modernization then produced the latest Igla incarnation recognized as \"Igla-S\" (NATO: SA-24 \"Grinch\"). A navalized form of the SA-18 is known to NATO as the SA-N-10 \"Grouse\".\n\r\nThe 9M39 series missile relied on a two-color infrared guidance system (minimizing vulnerability to flares deployed by targeted aircraft) and was propelled by a single solid fuel rocket motor. The missile managed an operational range out to 3.2 miles and could operate at ceilings of 11,000 feet while reaching speeds in the neighborhood of Mach 2.3. The lethal payload of the missile consisted of a 2.6lb warhead detonation reached by both contact and fuse. The missile was nearly as long as the launch tube itself and sported spring-loaded fins for in-flight stabilization after launch. With its new seeker, the missile now held an inherently longer effective range as well as improved engagement speeds. Perhaps the most noticeable improvement came from its self-protection against the latest in electro-optical jamming equipment. As such, the missile could manage a probable kill value as high as 48% against an unsuspecting, unprotected aircraft.\n\r\nThe SA-18 is utilized by a plethora of world powers with many owing procurement to close Soviet-Russian relations of the Cold War. As such, nations such as Egypt, Syria, Iran, Ukraine and Vietnam all field the SA-18 system.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f6a9e4ea-c5e3-452b-ae33-66eb5afb8e7b", "year_model": "2004", "weapon_name": "SA-24 (Grinch) / 9K338 Igla-S", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9K310 \"Igla-1\" (NATO: SA-16 \"Gimlet\") was designed, developed and produced alongside the improved, and technologically superior, 9K38 \"Igla\" (NATO: SA-18 \"Grouse\") man-portable, shoulder-launched anti-aircraft system.

The effect of such an element is two fold as it forces the targeted aircraft to fly above and beyond the range of the weapon, exposing it to the hazards of enemy radar or more potent surface-to-air defenses.

The weapon maintains a hit percentage of roughly 90%, though the HE (High Explosive) warhead is said to not accomplish much in the way of overall damage - as proven in some instances where damaged Israeli fighters were able to return to friendly airbases after receiving direct hits from Grail ground detachments during the Arab-Israeli War of 1973.\n\r\nNevertheless, the system can still be considered deadly in the event that critical systems are destroyed or damaged - in an aircraft that could be the cockpit, avionics or engine components and in rotary aircraft, that could be the cockpit, the tail rotor assembly or main rotor assembly.

The cartridge has since been introduced into a full line-up of Soviet/Russian weapons including the impressive AS \"Val\" and VSS \"Vintorez\" silenced assault/sniper (respectively) rifles. One of the unique qualities of the SR-3 itself is the very compact form that the base weapon takes on (more akin to a submachine gun than an assault rifle). This makes it highly suitable for special forces use as well as airborne infantry. Production of the SR-3 has been undertaken out of the famous Tula Arms Plant to which a modified form - the silenced SR-3M - has since emerged.\n\r\nThe SR-3 is a conventional gas-operated weapon utilizing a rotating bolt action.

The role is typically taken up by the submachine gun but there are times when an even handier, portable assault weapon is required. During the Cold War (1947-1991) between the East and the West, the Soviet Union sought to solve this issue within their ranks and called on local industry to develop a new close-quarters weapon. One entry into this competition became the Stechkin, an automatic pistol with qualities more akin to a machine pistol - the bridge between a semi-automatic handgun and a submachine gun. The Stechkin's formal name was \"Avtomaticheskiy Pistolet Stechkina\" or \"APS\", this literally translating to \"Automatic Pistol Stechkin\".\n\r\nIgor Stechkin was credited with the design of the pistol, hence it bears his name, and work began in the late-1940s and continued into the early-1950s.\n\r\nAt the core of the design was a blowback system of operation which centered on the 9x18mm Makarov Soviet pistol cartridge. The pistol had a selective-fire capability and could reach out, with some accuracy, to 655 feet while maintaining a rate-of-fire of 750 rounds-per-minute. Muzzle velocity of the outgoing bullet reached 1,115 meters-per-second. To promote better accuracy while in full-automatic fire, there was an optional solid shoulder stock attached to the base of the grip. Sighting was through an iron arrangement and the sidearm more or less mimicked in appearance the various John Browning-inspired semi-automatic service pistols of the period.\n\r\nAfter official evaluations and trials, this automatic pistol was formally adopted for service in 1951. Serial production was had through the Vytatsky Polyany Machine-Building Plant. Production of the APS pistol spanned from 1951 until 1958 and issuance was to vehicle and artillery crews as well as some officer-level candidates.

The lengthy development cycle is attributed to the tumultuous period following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disarray and economic slump that followed hampered the Russian arms industry.

This value balloons to over 100lb when the ammunition cassette is added.\n\r\nAvailable projectile types consist of 40mm \"caseless\" cartridges - these specially-designed projectiles negating the need for spent shell casings by design - combining the primer, propellant, and projectile into a single unit that is completely used up in the action. The AGS-40 fires three such types: the 7P39 High-Explosive, FRAGmentation (HE-FRAG) round, the 7P39P training round, and the 7P39U training round. The grenades are housed in a hardened circular cassette affixed to the right side of the weapon's frame. The disintegrating belt (arriving in 40-count strips) is looped over the frame and inserted into the firing chamber from the left.\n\r\nOf note is that the use of 40mm caliber is a decided departure from the long-standing reliance on 30mm grenade types common to Soviet-Russian launchers and puts this weapon more in line with offerings seen in the West.\n\r\nThe internal action involves a gas-operated piston with open-bolt component, allowing for automatic fire (5- and 10-round bursts as well as full-auto) to be achieved. Control of the weapon is through spade-type grip handles at the rear of the frame while an optional cushioned butt-plate / seat is noted, adding additional recoil-defeating value by utilizing the operator's own body weight in the firing action - this component locks into the rear two legs of the tripod (the tripod assembly itself provides some inherent recoil-dampening effects). While iron sights are supported, these are primarily retained for backup purposes as optics (typically PAG-17 2.7x magnification) aid in more precise firing down-range. The AGS-40 is capable of reaching target areas out to 2,500 meters and firing at a theoretical rate of 400 rounds-per-minute.\n\r\nThe AGS-40 began deliveries to the Russian armed forces in January 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "aab57e89-1907-42e7-bc92-c36fd4e9429f", "year_model": "1987", "weapon_name": "VSS Vintorez", "weapon_type": "Silenced Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe VSS \"Vintorez\" is a silenced sniper rifle that makes use of a permanent silencer assembly as well as specially-developed subsonic ammunition. The type shares nearly the same contours as the AS Val silenced assault rifle which was developed at the same time. Key markers between the two systems is the VSS's use of a slightly different subsonic cartridge, a fixed, skeletal wood shoulder stock and a long range scope. The VSS entered service with Soviet/Russian special forces in 1987 and has since seen broadened use by internal security forces as well as a regular army. Involvement in combat has been noted in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars and, most recently, the 2008 war against Georgia. Design of the VSS is attributed to Petr Serdjukov with manufacture being handled by the fabled Tula Arms Plant.\n\r\nThe silenced sniper rifle certainly has its value on any battlefield. Its inherent nature allows for quiet operation of the system against targets at range whereas the aforementioned AS Val assault rifle is useful at closer ranges. The VSS primarily relies on two key factors in its success - the specialized cartridge and the integrated silencer. The cartridge is the 9x39mm SP-5 which essentially breaks down as a rifle-caliber 7.62x39mm case with a widened neck to accept a 9mm bullet. It is a heavy cartridge and categorized as \"subsonic\". The AS Val assault rifle follows this same design initiative in its use of the 9x39mm SP-6 round though the VSS cartridge is an armor-piercing  grade cartridge which sets it apart. As in the AS Val, the VSS utilizes a permanently fixed silencer over the barrel and this serves to lower the muzzle velocity of the exiting rounds. While this also lowers the audible frequency of the weapon, it also restricts its range - the trade off of silenced weapons. However, the actual audible sound produced by the VSS is something akin to a whisper in actual operation - perfect for taking out unsuspecting sentries.\n\r\nBeyond its silenced capabilities, the VSS is more or less a conventional rifle system. It sports a boxy receiver with the charging handle and ejection port set to the right side of the body. The pistol grip is integrated with the hollowed stock which features two large loops, the forward most one being for the firer's hand. The hollowed nature of the stock lightened the weapon's overall weight. It is fixed so there is no prospect of making the VSS more compact during maneuvers but it makes for a more sturdy and stable platform in the long run. The VSS can, however, be broken down into key components for scheduled travels. The parts are contained in a provided hard case. The trigger unit is large and very Kalashnikov in its function and styling. The trigger loop is large enough to fit a gloved hand which is always an important consideration when supplying special forces elements. The magazine fits into the magazine well ahead of the trigger unit with the magazine release noted just aft of the well itself. The VSS fired from 10- or 20-round detachable box magazines. The forward handgrip is similar in design to the AS Val rifle, completed with a small area forend before the silencer assembly. The silencer assembly itself is basically tubular in its appearance with a rear sight affixed to the base portion (the section meeting the forend area) and a front sight fitted over the muzzle. The iron sights are adjustable and can be used to back up the standard-issue PSO-1-1 telescopic sight which is fitted over the receiver rear and connected to the gun from supports mounted along the left side of the body. Additionally, the VSS can be fitted with accessories or other scopes such as night vision.\n\r\nOverall, the VSS weighs in at just under 6lbs and sports a running length of 35 inches with an 8 inch barrel being used. The firing action is of gas-operation with a rotating bolt. The gas cylinder is mounted over the barrel as seen in nearly all Kalashnikov weapons. Rate-of-fire is listed at 800 to 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 951 feet per second. Like the AS Val before it, the VSS features just two firing modes - semi-automatic and single-shot. Effective range is out to 400 meters with a maximum range slightly further (at the expense of accuracy).\n\r\nThe \"VSS Vintorez\" name comes from the Russian \"Vintovka Snayperskaya Spetsialnaya\", translating to \"Special Sniper Rifle\" - which is exactly what the VSS represents.\r\n\t\t"}]}]}
