(\"Sleigh\") was adopted by the Soviet Army in 1981 as a replacement to the storied, World War 2-era 120mm Model 1943 series detailed elsewhere on this site. The type improved engagement ranges, tactical flexibility, operating weight, and transportability while reducing the required crew by one. It retained all of the indirect fire usefulness of its predecessor, firing 120mm shells of various types (HE, incendiary, illumination, smoke) out to ranges of 4.5 miles. With the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991, the Russian Army absorbed the weapon in its ranks and other former Soviet states elected to retain their stocks as well. This has led to continued use by Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, and Lithuania. Egypt is a foreign customer of the 2B11.\n\r\nThe 2B11 takes on a conventional field mortar form, incorporating the launch tube, bipod assembly, an MPM-44M optics set, and baseplate. A two-wheeled, rubber-tired carriage is integral and allows for quick displacement or transport under combat conditions. The complete system weighs 460lbs. The launch tube's mounting hardware provides an elevation reach of +45 to +80-degrees with an inherent traverse function of +/- 5 degrees from centerline. A trained crew can fire about 15 rounds per minute for sustained fire actions. Minimum engagement range is 0.30 miles with the maximum being 4.46 miles.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "45d97943-a272-4a54-80e1-afc3a881f4f3", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "2B14 Podnos", "weapon_type": "82mm Infantry Mortar", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2B14 \"Podnos\" is a Soviet-originated battlefield mortar of 82mm caliber. The system is of conventional design arrangement and function and has seen service since the 1980s. Design work was undertaken in 1983 with serial manufacturing had from the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant. The system has seen consistent action since introduction, fielded in such conflicts as the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present), and the Ukrainian-Russian War (2014-Present).\n\r\nThe mortar is made up of typical components as mortars go: the launch tube, the bipod support assembly, and recoil plate. The complete system tips the scales at 92.3 lb and requires a crew of four for optimal function. The launch tube is rated for 6lb High-Explosive (HE) projectiles of 82mm (3.2\") caliber and a trained crew can let loose with 30 rounds-per-minute of in-direct fire. The mounting hardware allows for an elevation span of 45- to 85-degrees and inherent traversal of +/- 8-degrees. Anything more than this required complete relocation of the mortar system. Effective range is out to 2.65 miles.\n\r\nThe weapon can be transported by the available 2F510 series 2x1 wheeled assembly or by a dedicated prime mover vehicle such as the GAZ-66 series military 4x4 wheeled truck or similar wheeled or tracked solution.\n\r\nBeyond its service with the Soviet Union, the mortar was purchased by the fighting forces of Georgia, Malaysia, Syria, and Ukraine and has also been seen in use with Lebanese militia elements. Unlike other Soviet weapons of the Cold War period, the 2B14 series did not go on to see widespread global acceptance. Former Soviet mortars were absorbed into the newly-established Russia Army after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and under 300 are believed to still be in active circulation with Russian forces while some 3,000 remain in storage (and assumed available if needed).\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Army has actively used its 2B14 systems against Russian troops and separatist supporters in its War in Donbas in the East of the country. Novorossiya rebels are known to have used these weapons against Ukrainian forces as well.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "0fa9a6a0-ee38-4722-9436-0e63f44abb94", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "2B9 Vasilek (Cornflower)", "weapon_type": "82mm Towed Heavy Gun-Mortar", "description": "\r\n        \tThe mortar as a battlefield weapon has been a mainstay of militaries for decades. In 1970, the Soviet Army introduced a new heavy-class \"gun-mortar\" as the 2B9 \"Vasilek\" - or \"Cornflower\". The system fired 82mm projectiles out to ranges of 4,270 meters reaching rates-of-fire up to 120 rounds-per-minute. With the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s-early 1990s, the weapon passed on to the modern Russian Army and the armies of Armenia and Ukraine. A foreign customer of the product became Syria.\n\r\nFor mobility, the 2B9 was set atop a heavy-duty, two-wheeled split-trail carriage system which allowed towing by mover vehicle or large-scale traversal adjustments by the crew (of at least four to six personnel). A sighting device allowed for more precise firing through up to 3x magnification. The launch tube could be loaded through its breech assembly or down the muzzle. The tube's mounting hardware held an inherent traverse span of 60-degrees to either side from center and an elevation span from -1 to +85 degrees. Each 82mm projectile weighed seven pounds. A recoil mechanism was fitted about the launch tube to contend with the forces at work. A circular baseplate was lowered prior to firing which raised the unit from its wheeled support while the rear of the system was suspended by the split-trail carriage arms.\n\r\nOriginal Vasilek models were the 2B9 series and these were followed by a modernized form in 1983 designated as the \"2B9M\". In 1988, a vehicle-mounted form emerged for use on MT-LB Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) which broadened the tactical value of both vehicle and weapon considerably - very useful combination for the indirect fire support role.\n\r\nThe Vasilek weapon has been in constant use since its inception, being seen as recently as in the fighting of the Syrian Civil War (2011-????) (by both rebel elements and government forces) and in the Donbass Region of the Ukrainian Civil War (2014-????)

The L96 originally competed successfully against the Parker-Hale Model 85 rifle in the mid-1980's to become the standard British Army sniper rifle, replacing the aged Lee-Enfield L42A1 series. The engineering process incorporated light alloys, plastic and metal into the design. This melding allowed for greater field abuse (the weapon could take a good deal of external punishment but still keep the internal components in good working order).\n\r\nDesigned to achieve first-round hit at 600 meters and \"harassing fire\" out to 1,100 total meters, the Accuracy International L96 sniper rifle has been upgraded with a new x3-x12 x50 sight and spotting scope. Select units also field the L115A1 Long range Rifle (LRR), which fires an 8.59mm bullet, heavier than the 7.62mm round of the L96 and less likely to be deflected over extremely long ranges. The L96A1's free-floating barrel is constructed of stainless steel and can be changed in 5 minutes. The system itself is designed to allow the single user the ability to carry out all but the most major repairs by himself in the field with the necessary tools being three Allen wrenches and a screwdriver.\n\r\nThe L96A1 is chambered to fire the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge from a 10-round detachable box magazine. An adjustable bipod is fitted forward under the barrel. The weapon features a muzzle velocity of 2,790 feet per second. The L96A1 can also be issued with a variety of scope mounts, collapsible stock and silencer and is available on the commercial market. A military .50 caliber (12.7mm) model is also available.\n\r\nThe L96 is part of the larger Accuracy International \"Arctic Warfare\" line of rifles for use by military, special forces and law enforcement branches. The L96A1 is the British Army designation of the Accuracy International PM (\"Precision Marksman\") model entered into competition to become the standard British sniper rifle.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "caef90ce-35d3-49e3-9b6a-4883bd89af2c", "year_model": "1975", "weapon_name": "APS (Avtomat Podvodny Spetsialny)", "weapon_type": "Underwater Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tSince special infantry elements require special weapons to achieve their given tasks, Soviet engineers designed the APS (\"Avtomat Podvodny Spetsialny\" = \"Special Under Water Assault Rifle\") to meet the needs of Soviet frogmen charged with countering the threat posed by underwater enemies such as the Navy SEALs of the United States. The design challenge lay in creating a weapon that could also retain some killing power on dry land which resulted in the selection of a gas operated system with a rotating bolt arrangement not unlike the original Kalashnikov AK-47. In order to succeed in its primary role of firing underwater, the weapon was chambered for a unique fin-stabilized dart/bolt as opposed to traditional cartridged ammunition. The metal dart measured nearly 5 inches long (its caliber officially listed as \"5.66x39mm MPS\") and sported a pointed head and bulged rear (representing the cartridge). The cartridge's specifications were akin to that of the Soviet 5.56x45mm round. The bolts were fired through a repeating action and down a smoothbore barrel assembly (as opposed to a rifled one). The end result was the APS which has been notably used by SPETSNAZ special forces since its inception.\n\r\nExternally, the APS is highly recognizable primarily due to its oversized magazine which is required by the stacking shape of the metal darts. The receiver is rectangular in its appearance and features a fixed angled pistol grip with trigger unit at the rear. There is an extendable twin-strut wire buttstock affixed for shoulder supporting - its collapsible nature ensures a compact weapon for underwater movement. The butt slides along two channels to either side of the receiver. The gas system is fitted over the barrel as in the Kalashnikov family of automatic weapons. The barrel extends a short distance ahead of the gas cylinder. Overall length with the butt extended is 32.5 inches and 24 inches when collapsed while overall weight is a manageable 5lbs when empty and approximately 7.5lbs when loaded.\n\r\nThe weapon's range is inherently limited in water and on land because of the specialized darts it fires. Maximum underwater range just over 30 feet though environmental factors such as depth come into play. On land, the weapon can reach out to ranges of 330 feet though accuracy degrades rather quickly - the internal makeup of the barrel is smoothbore and the metal darts are not entirely designed for ground-based warfare. Muzzle velocity (through the air) is roughly 1,200 feet per second. The APS makes use of a 26-round plastic detachable box magazine which adds much drag in underwater movement.\n\r\nThe APS rifle has been produced under the brand labels of Tula Arms Plant and TsNIITochMash since 1975. Design of the weapon is attributed to Vladimir Simonov. Soviet underwater forces were also issued specialized underwater-firing pistols during the Cold War years - though of equally limited range. The APS was eventually replaced by the more modern ASM-DT rifle which entered service in the new millennium - also produced by the Tula Arms Plant though now for the Russian Army in 5.45x39mm chambering (still retaining the gas-operated action and 26-round magazine).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3cddbbe6-db56-4079-98ae-75fab18abc57", "year_model": "1987", "weapon_name": "AS Val (Avtomat Special'nyj)", "weapon_type": "Silenced Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AS Val is a specialized automatic firearm of Soviet-era origin - essentially an assault rifle weapon system with a permanent silencer installed for clandestine operations. The weapon was designed by the TsNITITochMash state design bureau while production was charged to the famous Tula Arms Plant, the latter amazingly in existence since 1712. The AS Val first appeared in Soviet inventories in 1987 and has since been issued (primarily) to special forces (including Spetsnaz) and top-level security groups though it has also become a staple of the regular Soviet/Russian Army over time.\n\r\nThe heart of the AS Val is its \"subsonic\" ammunition which works extremely well in conjunction with the silencer component. The weapon is chambered for the \"9x39mm SP-6\" cartridge which is a rifle-caliber 7.62x39mm case with a special \"widened\" neck designed to accept a 9mm bullet - the latter a cartridge very common to semi-automatic pistols and submachine guns. This modified Soviet/Russian cartridge has continued to find growing use throughout other specialized weapon families of the Russian military since its inception. As a whole, the AS Val is key to the stealthy nature required of certain combat elements - where neutralizing unsuspecting sentries or fighting one's way out of trouble without garnering unneeded attention is something of a trademark.\n\r\nOutwardly, the AS Val showcases conventional lines consistent with other assault rifle designs. The receiver holds the major internal working components while the trigger group and pistol grip are well-integrated into the weapon's layout. The trigger is large, suitable for a gloved hand, while the pistol grip is rather plain and not as rearward-angled as in other Kalashnikov-style weapons. The buttstock consists of a metal framework and is collapsible over the left side of the receiver. Its skeletal nature ensures a lighter overall weight and does not impede regular gun functions for the charging handle and ejection port are set to the right side of the body. Magazines are fed just ahead of the trigger group and include 10-, 20- or 30-round detachable, curved box magazines though the 20-round version appears as the standard for the series. The specialized cartridges stacked within the magazine make the magazine deeper than a traditional box. A magazine release is noted just aft of the magazine well and ahead of the trigger component - a Kalashnikov identifier. There is a short forend handgrip set ahead of the receiver and magazine regions. Ahead of this is the principle identifying feature of the AS Val - the heavy duty silencer which appears as nothing more than a featureless cylinder simply added to the gun structure. The silencer is designed and constructed in such a way that the weapon can fire on full-automatic consistently without the silencer assembly suffering any irreversible fracturing in the short-term. A selector switch near the trigger allows for full-automatic or single-shot fire modes. The sights are affixed to the silencer assembly which clears the upper receiver from structural \"clutter\". Therefore, scopes or other accessories can be affixed to the weapon. Sighting does include standard adjustable iron fixtures (rear sector sight, front post) while various optics (including night scopes) can be installed along the top of the receiver.\n\r\nThe firing action of the AS holds origins in the tried-and-true Kalashnikov pattern and consists of a conventional gas-operation with a rotating bolt. As in other Kalashnikov guns, the gas cylinder is set above the barrel. Rate-of-fire is approximately 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of about 970 feet per second. As with most \"silenced\" weapons, range is limited when compared to that of traditional, non-silenced assault rifles - the AS Val managing effectiveness out to 300 meters with a maximum \"reach\" out to 400 meters. This is largely due to the heavier cartridge and sound suppression system, which lower the muzzle velocity considerably. Overall length of the weapon with the stock extended is 35 inches while a folded stock creates a more compact 24-inch form - suitable for close-in fighting. Unloaded weight is roughly 6lbs.\n\r\nTo date, the AS Val has seen published combat actions in the 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars as well as in the short-lived Georgian conflict of 2008. In the latter action both the Russian and Georgian special forces utilized the weapon. \n\r\nThe \"AS\" designation is born of the Russian \"Avtomat Special'nyj\" terminology, which translates to \"Special Automatic Rifle\". The \"Val\" name is the designation which translates to \"Shaft\", no doubt identifying the long silencer that is fitted to the weapon.\n\r\nThe VSS \"Vintorez\" silenced sniper rifle is very similar to the design of the AS Val silenced assault rifle though it is differentiated outwardly by its fixed, hollowed buttstock and a specialized telescopic sight for long-range work.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "89229562-c192-45a7-ac55-562828aa3b5f", "year_model": "1992", "weapon_name": "AT-13 (Saxhorn-2) / 9K115-2 (Metis-M)", "weapon_type": "Wire-Guided Anti-Tank Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AT-13 \"Saxhorn-2\" is a man-portable anti-tank missile system of Russian origin and is a modernized form of the original AT-7 \"Saxhorn\". The major difference between the two systems is the AT-13s newer missile which sports larger dimensions, an increased operational range and modern internal technology. It is produced by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau and entered service with the Russian Army in 1992 to serve alongside mechanized armored units. KBP has a long-standing history after their founding in 1927 in Tula and the firm has gone on to produce a variety of anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-infantryweapon systems for the Soviet/Russian military. Several Soviet/Russian-allied nations have also moved on procuring the relatively new weapon system to help modernize anti-tank forces and include Croatia, South Korea, Iran and Syria. The Saxhorn-2 allows for on-the-spot, point-defense against all types of armored vehicles as she is made to be highly portable with thought given to ease and expediency of use.\n\r\nThe Saxhorn-2 system is made up of three major components consisting of the 9M131F missile, the 9P151 launch tube and a 1PBN86-VI thermal imaging sight. The standard operating crew is three personnel which facilitates both the firing action and transport of the Saxhorn-2 system as a whole. Setup of the Saxhorn-2 is roughly 15 seconds for a trained fire team (the launch tube is transported with a ready-to-fire missile in place) however the missile can only be fired from a standing or prone position. Since the launcher is reusable, the fire team can actually supply a semi-consistent rate-of-fire of about three missiles per minute. At least five missiles are assigned each Saxhorn-2 fire team to facilitate reloading of the launcher. Since one missile is already in the launch tube with the main operator, the other four reloads are split as pairs between the two remaining personnel and these are carried in addition to their personal weapons. The Saxhorn-2 system measures in at 980mm with a 130mm diameter. Weight is roughly 13.8 kilograms. Like other anti-tank missile systems of this class, the Saxhorn-2 can also be fixed to fire from vehicles of various types, making for a mobile anti-tank weapons platform when required.\n\r\nThe 9M131F missile features a solid-fuel rocket booster engine that supplies an operational range between 0.08 and 1.5 kilometers (0.049 to 0.93 miles) - for the crews safety, weapons such as this generally have a minimum operating range. Speed at the height of its post-launch phase is approximately 656 feet per second (200 meters per second). The missile is guided to the target via a wire link (wire-guided) that receives commands and course corrections to provide for relative pin-point accuracy. The base missile is capped with a HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) warhead designed to penetrate armor facings. If equipped as such, the Saxhorn-2 fire team can also launch a thermobaric-based warhead missile against personnel or structures. Thermobaric weapons expand the traditional blast wave for greater detrimental effects using available nearby oxygen (as in a fuel-air bomb).\n\r\nIsraeli Army Merkava main battle tanks reportedly encountered Saxhorn-2s when combating Hezbollah forces in the 2006 Lebanon War. While Russia denied the sale of its missile systems to the group, it is believed these were obtained via Syrian connections which itself procured the anti-tank system from Russia.\n\r\nRussia formally designates the Saxhorn-2 as the 9K115-2 \"Metis-M\". AT-13 \"Saxhorn-2\" is the NATO reporting name.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "fa30c67c-6d13-4714-b9c0-21c25c3a1c3c", "year_model": "1998", "weapon_name": "AT-14 (Spriggan) / 9M133 (Kornet)", "weapon_type": "Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) System", "description": "\r\n        \tRussian military industry has not rested on its laurels with regards to viable armor-defeating measures - hence the relatively recent introduction of the 9M133 \"Kornet\" (\"Cornet\"), designated by NATO as the AT-14 \"Spriggan\".

Design and development of the system began in 1962 and serial manufacture of the AT-5 was conducted by the Tula Machinery Design Bureau and the weapon system officially entered service with the Soviet Army in 1974 and continues active operations today. The AT-5 was developed alongside the similar AT-4 \"Spigot\" (9K111 \"Fagot\"), the AT-5 being the larger of the two dimensionally but the both systems largely sharing much in the way of technology available to that time. This similarity means that the AT-5 missile can be used effectively with (later) production versions of the AT-4 launcher.\n\r\nThe AT-5 missile sports a weight of 32lbs with a length of 45 inches and a diameter of 135mm. The missile is capped with a tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) warhead that is detonated on contact with a hardened surface (armor, fortified walls, etc...). Propulsion is via an internal solid-fuel rocket motor that provides the AT-5 with a maximum operational range of approximately 2.5 miles with a speed equal to 660 feet per second. As with most launched missile systems, there is a minimum effective range of approximately 230 feet. As the AT-5 missile is wire-guided in nature, it requires the target to be in line-of-sight (LOS) with the launcher/operator. Guidance is only effective up to the length of the available wires leading from the launcher to the missile itself. The missile tracks itself to the target by reading a small transmitter at the rear of the missile as relative to the intended target. The missile then communicates corrected flight paths via the wire link to the launcher. The missile can be launched from both a man-portable launcher or from a launch affixed to a weapons mounting on a vehicle though the latter is most often seen. Both launch points offer up benefits with the man-portable versions being easier to conceal (for the sake of ambush) and the vehicle-mounted versions allowing for superior tactical mobility (perfect for hunting tanks).\n\r\nThe launch system contains the complete optics and launch mechanism critical to the AT-5 function. The operator actuates the trigger system which forces a gas generator on the missile to ignite and launch the missile free from the launch tube. It is only when the missile has safely cleared the launcher that an internal solid fuel rocket motor ignites to take over the flight path and sends the missile towards the intended target as dictated by the operator through the optical system. Four fins affixed to the missile ensure a proper trajectory and stability/rotation in flight. If the internal guidance system from launcher to the missile is affected by a tracking jammer emitted against it, the operator can then elect to guide the missile manually by way of the launcher itself.\n\r\nSince inception into the Soviet inventory, a variety of operators have stepped forward to embrace the anti-armor qualities of the AT-5. These include Egypt, Finland, Georgia, Indonesia, India, Iran, Poland, Turkey, Syria and Ukraine. Iran has taken to producing a local copy of the original weapon system under the designation of Towsan-1/M113 at the beginning of the century. These are thought to have been smuggled into Hezbollah hands due to Israeli claims that their tanks encountered them in the 2006 Lebanon War. The actual effect of these missile systems against Israel tanks is unknown. Other anti-tank systems are also thought to have found their way into the conflict through Syria according to Israeli reports.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4ff94bbd-4581-4aba-ab2b-ef114d3e8cc8", "year_model": "1979", "weapon_name": "AT-7 (Saxhorn) / 9M115 (Mongrel)", "weapon_type": "Portable Anti-Tank Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AT-7 \"Saxhorn\" (officially Russian designation of \"9K115 Metis\", Metis translating to \"Mongrel\") was developed to coexist alongside the AT-4 \"Spigot\" series of portable, anti-tank wire-guided missile systems in the Soviet Army inventory. The AT-4 was a large company level weapon system that was fielded with integrated optics, tripod and a large launch tube for the 9M111/9M111-2 and 9M111M series missiles. The weapon system went on to be used by over 30 counties around the world including many Soviet-friendly parties and was produced in the thousands. The AT-7 maintained much of the appearance of the original AT-4 but introduced a revised missile that was lighter in weight, made to modern specifications and featuring a simplified tripod assembly.\n\r\nLike other anti-tank weapons of this classification, the AT-7 is operated by two specially trained personnel - one to manage the optics and launcher and the other to reload the launch tube component. In this paired fashion, transporting the AT-7 system is divided between the two personnel and up to four missiles are carried by the group. The AT-7 was traditionally issued to such two-man fire teams at the company level as a part of the Soviet motorized rifle companies, each company to tally some three launchers each.\n\r\nAt its core, the AT-7 breaks down into three key components - these being the optics suite, the launch tube and the mount (the latter also known as a launch post). The AT-7 projectile consists of a three-fin stabilized missile that operates initially from a booster before the rocket motor takes over after clearing the launch tube. The missile is then guided along a wire attached from missile to launcher which means that range is somewhat restrictive and line-of-sight on the target is imperative. The missile's warhead is a HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) shaped charge and weighs in at 5.5lbs. Operational range is approximately 1,000 meters with a 40 meter minimum (the latter for the safety of the firing crew). Despite the standard issue of a tripod with the AT-7 launcher, the system can be fired from the shoulder. The AT-7 launcher can also be utilized in relatively confined spaces with a safety clearance of about six meters directly behind the launcher recognized.\n\r\nThe AT-7 Saxhorn first entered service with the Red Army in 1979 and continues in operation even today. Production has been handled by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. A newer, modernized version of the Saxhorn - designated as the \"AT-13 Saxhorn-2\" (known formally as the \"9K115-2 Metis-M\") - sports a revised missile that is heavier than the original design but features an increased operational range with better penetrative capabilities thanks to its larger warhead. The Saxhorn-2 entered operational service in 1992.\n\r\nTo date, operators of the AT-7 have included (beyond the Soviet/Russian army) Croatia, Hungary, Iran, Moldova, Poland and Syria. Hungary has been known as a producer of the weapon system for interested global parties.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "7864e36e-5576-4166-966a-ac2b94960e94", "year_model": "1963", "weapon_name": "Dragunov SVD (Snayperskaya Vintovka sistemy Dragunova)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle / Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tFor a good duration of the Cold War period, the Dragunov \"SVD\" (\"Snayperskaya Vintovka sistem'y Dragunova\") series of semi-automatic rifles stood as the standard-issue sniper rifle of Soviet troops, allied Warsaw Pact nations and Soviet export customers. The rifle was introduced in 1963 and quickly became respected for its reliability and accuracy with its actions based in the highly successful Kalashnikov series of automatic assault weapons (namely the AK-47). As a semi-automatic rifle, the Dragunov SVD was more akin to a Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR), terminology used today to differentiate a squad-level precision rifle over that of a traditional accuracy-minded sniper rifle (which typically uses a manual bolt-action system).\n\r\nThe Soviets had always been keen on using large powerful, man-stopping cartridges so it was no surprise that the SVD continued chambering for the ubiquitous 7.62x54mmR Soviet cartridge, this feeding from a 10-round detachable box magazine. The result was a precise and accurate weapon system capable of engaging targets out as far as 875 yards.\n\r\nWhile it was largely based on the Kalashnikov system, the Dragunov SVD became a whole new rifle design all its own. Internally, the action was slightly reworked from its long-stroke piston form to a short-stroke arrangement providing a lighter, reduced movement which was required to maintain accuracy. Coupled with a slightly reworked trigger offering  a smoother response and the SVD became the weapon of choice for \"headhunters\" requiring range and effectiveness as well as ease-of-use and general reliability. The base optics set became the \"PSO-1\" series daytime scope (with some limited Infra-Red capability built-in) and this was backed by traditional iron sights (including an adjustable rear notch). The 1PN51 / 1PN58 series night vision scopes were later supported. A wooden stock and related furniture became hallmarks of the SVD series (as well as other Soviet weapons of the day).\n\r\nOverall weight of the rifle was 9.5 kilograms with an unloaded magazine and the scope fitted. Overall length was 48.2 inches with the barrel measuring 24.4 inches long. A trainer shooter could manage to fire off about 30 rounds-per-minute if need be, compliments of the semi-automatic action.\n\r\nAn airborne infantry version was made as the \"SVDS\" and this model featured a folding tubular metal stock to allow for a compact footprint. The night vision-equipped version of this rifle became the \"SVDSN\". The \"SVU\" was a specialized model sporting a shortened barrel and arranged in a \"bullpup\" configuration which seated the action and feed aft of the trigger unit. It offered specialist troops (like Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs operators) better accuracy through additional measures instituted to help combat recoil. A selective-fire version of this weapon became the \"SVU-A\" and this model fed from a 20-round box magazine. The \"SVDK\" was an offshoot of the SVD line chambered in 9.3x64mm. A commercial version of the SVD was manufactured as the \"Medved\" (\"Bear\") and chambered in 9x54R cartridge (then later in 7.62x51mm NATO).\n\r\nPoland was a key operator of the SVD series throughout its time as part of the Soviet Union and ultimately developed a modernized form under the designation of \"SWD-M\". This offering involved the addition of a bipod assembly under the forend, use of a more powerful 6x42 magnification scope and a heavy-duty barrel assembly to fall more in line with a traditional sniper weapon. Romania developed their PSL rifle from the SVD framework as did Iraq with through their \"Tabuk\" and \"Al-Gadissiya\" sniper rifles.\n\r\nBeyond the aforementioned global operators were users ranging from Algeria and Argentina to Vietnam and Venezuela. Some took to local manufacture of the rifle product (both licensed and unlicensed) like NORINCO of China and their \"Type 79\". Finland knew the SVD as the \"7.62 TKIV Dragunov\" and Iran managed a local version as the \"Nakhjir 3 Sniper Rifle\".\n\r\nIts global proliferation meant that the SVD series went on to see considerable combat action during the course of its long-running service career. This has included the Vietnam War (1955-1975), the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Gulf War (1990-1991), the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1999), both Chechen Wars (1994-1996, 1999-2000), the wars in Afghanistan (2001-2014) and Iraq (2003-2011), South Ossetia (2008), the Libyan Civil War (2011) and the ongoing War in Donbass (2014-Present) and Syrian Civil War (2011-Present).\n\r\nDespite its age, the SVD continues to be a favorite amongst trained military personnel, guerilla fighters, rebels and sport shooters alike and will undoubtedly be one of those rare firearms to see the century mark in terms of consecutive years in service.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a17d7dee-0761-4c99-93d3-9e8956678185", "year_model": "1939", "weapon_name": "F1 (Hand Grenade - Soviet)", "weapon_type": "Hand Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \t\"F1\" is used to designate a variety of hand grenades of modern design and of the 20th century. The Soviet Union used the F1 designation for its standardized anti-personnel fragmentation infantry hand grenade spawned out of necessity during World War 2 to help combat the scourge of the Nazi invasion of the Motherland, begun through Hitler's \"Operation Barbarossa\", in June of 1941. As such, the Soviet defense industry awoke and began a massive program to push the German Army back to Berlin. The F1 proved quite effective in its intended role and was, itself, based on the F1 grenade of French origin.\n\r\nDesign of the Soviet F1 was rather straight-forward. The external steel casing was ribbed to ensure a solid hand hold. The fuse was integrated to the grenade body and actuated by manual removal of a safety component. Range was as far as a soldier could throw it and the blast radius within was rather standard - 15 meters for optimal effect and out to 30 meters peripheral. Additionally, shrapnel could reach much further than that due to the explosion. The explosive filling was a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) base of 60 grams. The entire F1 unit weighed in at 600 grams and featured a diameter of 55 millimeters. The fuse could feature a delay of 0 seconds to 13 seconds, this variable nature ensuring that it could be both thrown within a window of relative safety, or used as a hidden boobytrap explosive of sorts, this triggered by some external means depending on the setup.\n\r\nThe F1 saw extensive service with the Red Army in World War 2. It was quantitatively produced to the point that it was also exported out to Soviet satellite nations and allies in the post-war world, ensuring its place in the annals of military history. Its reach was such that the weapon can still be found in the far off places of the world today, a testament to its effective design and global reach.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "0ad21c9a-7b68-475d-b7bc-f77b948abd61", "year_model": "1978", "weapon_name": "GP-25 / GP-30 GL", "weapon_type": "Single-Shot 40mm Muzzle-Loaded Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe GP series of under-slung, single-shot, muzzle-loading 40mm grenade launchers was developed for the Soviet Army rifleman beginning in 1972. Work spanned into 1978 to which limited production ensued under the KBP Instrument Design Bureau brand label. The type was made compatible with the Kalashnikov \"AK\" family of assault weapons and intended to broaden the tactical reach of the Soviet infantryman considerably - matching the American M203-armed infantryman per step. The weapon was designed to fire a standard FRAG (FRAGmentation) grenade, smoke, tear gas, anti-riot baton and a specialized \"bouncing\" grenade and, as such, the GP family of launchers could be called upon to handle a variety of anti-personnel tasks with varying levels of lethality.\n\r\nThe GP was developed around a \"High-Low Pressure System\" in which to handle the resultant recoil effects of the launching 40mm projectile without the need of a rocket-based propulsion system. The system was devised by German engineers in the latter stages of World War 2 and subsequently adopted by the Soviets in the post-war world. Similarly, the Americans developed their M79 breech-loading 40mm single-shot grenade launcher along the same lines and these saw widespread use in the Vietnam War before being replaced by the underslung 40mm M203 series mated to the M16 assault rifle.\n\r\nThe Soviet single-shot 40mm grenade launcher first appeared in limited form under the designation of \"BG-15\" to which then the definitive \"GP-25\" production mark was unveiled. A modernized and simplified form, the \"GP-30\", has since been introduced which has more-or-less replaced the original aging GP-25 series. The original GP-25 fielded an overall weight of 3.3lbs and overall length of 12.7 inches while the updated GP-30 was made lighter and shorter at 3lbs with a 10.8 inch length. Both shared the same 4.7 inch barrel length and muzzle velocity was equal at 250 feet per second, largely in line with Western offerings. In the GP system, 40mm grenades are actuated by a percussion cap type base which ignites the grenade's propellant, forcing the projectile from the muzzle end of the barrel. The internal makeup of the launcher's barrel is rifled to promote a rotating stabilizing effect on the exiting grenade which allows for greater engagement ranges and some level of accuracy at range when compared to smoothbore barrel types. Construction of the GP family of grenade launchers is noted as very robust, allowing for a prolonged service life in the worst of battlefield conditions - very much a part of Soviet weapons design philosophy.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a7b4e991-2db7-4b02-a4cd-58116c8dcadc", "year_model": "1994", "weapon_name": "Izhmash AN-94 (Abakan)", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AK-47 altered the world military stage by becoming a ubiquitous combat system available to the general masses. The weapon proved relatively inexpensive to produce and, perhaps more importantly, it was a robust field performer with a reliable action and easy-to-operate in the \"greenest\" of hands. As such, the AK-47 - Kalashnikov's best known and easily recognizable assault rifle - went on to be found in all parts of the world. Within time, the series was modernized with the changing era including a major facelift in the 1970s (the AK-74) and, again, in the 1990s (the composite-minded AK-100 series). The newest incarnation is the \"AK-12\" manufactured by the storied concern of Izhmash and currently (2012) undergoing evaluation by the Russian military to become the next standard-issue automatic weapon of its army. It is expected that the AK-12 will be produced through a \"family\" of automatic weapons to include the base assault rifle, a shortened carbine form, a compact submachine gun, a dedicated sniper/sharpshooter's rifle and a light machine gun consistent with prior Russian Army infantry doctrine (the AK-47/AK-74 itself was developed into varied forms to suit battlefield needs within time). The AK-12 designation marks the finalized production-ready form of the prototype AK-200 detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nWith the export market in mind and proliferation of different cartridge types around the world, the AK-12 will be an inherently modular product that, with some modification to the base internal arrangement and barrel, the weapon will be available in a variety of calibers to further suit customer requirements. Additionally, adoption of a Picatinny rail system now allows use of various non-Russian accessories including laser aimers, tactical flashlights, grips, night vision scopes, reflex sights and the like. In this way, the AK-12 system will be highly adaptable and just as highly marketable on the world stage.\n\r\nThe basic assault rifle form of the Russian Army will be chambered for the 5.45x39mm Soviet cartridge. There are two proposed NATO-standard forms in play - the 5.56x45mm NATO and 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge types. Additionally, support is expected for the 6.5mm Grendel and 7.62x39mm Soviet rounds as well. The firing action will remain consistent across all forms, however, and revolve around a proven gas-operated, long stroke piston utilizing a rotating bolt function. The AK-12 receiver will support the standard curved 30-round magazine, a 60-round AK-74-style casket or a 100-round drum (in the light machine gun role). Rate-of-fire is estimated between 600 and 1,000 rounds per minute based on configuration and cartridge size. Muzzle velocity is approximately 2,950 feet per second with an effective range out to 2,000 feet (again, depending on field conditions, selected cartridge and general weapon configuration). The AK-12 receiver will sport a more reserved ambidextrous thumb-actuated firing selector found near the pistol grip (as opposed to the traditionally large firing selector featured in AK rifles prior). The magazine release/catch will be located in its usual place behind the magazine well within easy reach. The gas cylinder will be set in its usual Kalashnikov arrangement just above the barrel assembly while the barrel will be capped by a new slotted muzzle brake. Another notable change is the relocation of the rear iron sight from the middle of the receiver top to the rear of the receiver (this will be complemented by a conventional forward iron sight just aft of the muzzle brake).  The AK-12 will be capable of semi-automatic fire, a three-round burst mode and full-automatic fire as well as the requisite safety. The charging handle will be set along the right side of the receiver as will the ejection port. Picatinny rails are noted over the top of the receiver and the sides and underside of the handguard which will allow for multiple accessories to be fitted. Overall construction of the weapon appears to be a mix of steel and plastics (steel for the major receiver portions, gas cylinder and barrel while plastics being used elsewhere to save on cost and weight).\n\r\nThe carbine version will carry the designation of AK-12U while the submachine gun will be known as the PPK-12. The sniper rifle variant will be known as the SVD-12 while the light machine gun will be assigned the designation of RPK-12.

All forms will also incorporated a side-folding stock and interchangeable barrel assemblies for an increased modular approach. The light machine gun will make use of a heavy duty bipod, heavier, longer barrel assembly and 100-round drum (as in the RPK-74 before it) to fulfill its dedicated battlefield role.\n\r\nThe inherent design of this automatic rifle family will make it accessible to all manner of soldier - special forces, commando, airborne infantry, basic infantry, support and logistics as well as the guerrilla fighter.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "190b3cf1-2075-4fd7-a3b1-879d9527d112", "year_model": "1961", "weapon_name": "Izhmash RPK (Ruchnoy Pulemyot Kalashnikova)", "weapon_type": "Light Machine Gun (LMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPK (\"Ruchnoi Pulemyot Kalashnikova\") entered service in 1961 as a powerful firearm, developed from the PK series of weapons.  Externally, the weapon is essentially similar in appearance to the AK-47 assault rifle.  This similarity is due to both systems being developed by the prolific and highly successful designer Kalashnikov, the hero of the Soviet Union. The success of the AK-47 led to the Soviet military asking for a similar design to replace the light machine gun that was in service at the time - the Degtyarev RPD. So Kalashnikov lengthened the AK with a heaver barrel and fitted a bipod to support sustained automatic fire. Kalashnikov also stole the RPD stock design, which was popular with the troops, and changed the rear sight to allow for windage adjustments.  The 30-round AK magazines were interchangeable, however, larger magazines of 40 rounds and a 75-round drum were needed to satisfy the full automatic requirement. The gun was eventually ordered for the Red Army in 1961 but did not enter service until 1964. Each infantry squad was issued one RPK along with the 75-round drum magazine. Airborne units were issued the RPKS featuring the folding stock.  \n\r\nThe RPK was produced to operate with ease and to be nearly jam free. A major bonus was the commonality of parts with the AK service rifle series. The RPK utilizes a simple gas operated system firing from a closed bolt. Pulling the trigger begins the firing action - a round is fired and gas is produced when the powder burns and enters a small gas port pushing small pistons. The bolt is pushed back and the gas pressure is released allowing the bolt to be pushed forward by a spring. For night actions the NSP-2 infrared sight can be attached.\n\r\nAs with all weapons the RPK has her drawbacks. The closed bolt firing action and the barrel are not a quick change in the field. If the operator has good fire discipline few problems occur, however in combat situations discipline can go out the window. Optimal sustained fire is around 80 rounds per minute - if overused, chambered rounds could \"cook off\" and barrel damage could ensue.  The size and weight of the box magazine is limited the amount of ammunition carried by the weapons crew - very different from the amount of belt ammunition carried around the necks of US soldiers in Viet Nam for the M60 general purpose machine gun.  \n\r\nThe RPK is still in service, seeing first combat action in the Vietnam War while it is being used by terrorists today in Afghanistan and around the world with many thousands having been produced.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c20cceb3-bdf3-4bca-8c7e-ba9c0d88603b", "year_model": "1995", "weapon_name": "Izhmash Saiga-12", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Combat Shotgun", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian firm Izhmash produces the impressive Saiga-12, a semi-automatic fire-capable combat shotgun that has earned a high level of respect for both its lethality and its reliability since its introduction in the 1990's. It is produced in a handful of variants and can fire a variety of ammunition types, calibers and magazines and can be operated in any climate. As the Izhmash firm had already maintained experience in production of Kalashnikov-pattern guns it is no surprise to see the commonality of design and parts between the Kalashnikov designs and the Saiga-12.\n\r\nThe base Saiga-12 sports an exterior look not unlike the Kalashnikov AK-47. In fact, the body appears essentially the same and features the identifiable lever-safety along the right side and the firing action is directly descended from the legendary AK-47. The pistol grip is fitted behind the trigger guard and angular detachable box magazine. Like AK-47's, the Saiga-12 also makes use of a low-fitting barrel with the gas tube mounted above. A wrap-around hand guard protects the user from touching the hot gas tube. The shotgun system also comes off of the same assembly lines that produce the Kalashnikov AK-74M and AK-100 rifle series and are denoted with the red Izhmash triangle logo featuring an upwards-facing arrow. The Saiga-12 can be manufactured with a traditional solid buttstock (Saiga-12), extending tubular buttstock or a skeletal collapsible stock (Saiga-12S, Saiga-12K, Saiga-12S EXP-01) for increased portability while still others  sport a traditional hunting rifle-style buttstock with integrated pistol grip. The system - for obvious reasons - also sports a much larger ammunition extraction hole for spent shell casings, this along the right side of the body. The overall finish is a matte black powder with a slight texture feel.\n\r\nThe Saiga-12 is characterized as a self-loading smooth bore 12-guage shotgun. The Saiga-12 can fire from a 2-, 5-, 8-, 10-, or 12-round detachable box magazines. Additionally, this can be replaced by a 20-round ammunition drum. The Saiga-12 is available in .30-06, 7.62x39mm, .308 Winchester, 9x53R, 5.6x39mm and .223 Remington calibers as well as 20- and .410 shot gauges. The firing operation is gas-operated, featuring a rotating bolt. The gas system is adjustable depending on the type of ammunition being utilized. Barrel options include lengths up to 24 inches and threaded/non-threaded types. One drawback of the firing system has been the lack of a hold-open bolt device after the last round is fired, resulting in a more complicated reloading process.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "e332a466-1f17-4901-b092-5eefe80f8dfc", "year_model": "1998", "weapon_name": "Izhmash SV-98", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian SV-98 sniper was brought about to replace the ages-old SVD series in some Russian agencies. While the SVD series proved a capable long-range sniping platform in its own right, it still maintained origins well-laid in the Cold War years. What modern Russia needed now was a more modern system taking into account the changing face of warfare, Russian doctrine in the post-Cold War world and technological advancements. Thusly, the SV-98 sniper rifle was born.\n\r\nDesign of the SV-98 - under the direction of Vladimir Stronskiy, began in 1998. The design was based on the Izhmash Record-CISM series. After a period of evaluation, serial production followed and was undertaken out of the Izhmash OJSC facilities with service entry of the weapon into the inventories of the Russian special forces - including Spetsnaz- and some police units in 1998.\n\r\nOutwardly, the SV-98 attains a most conventional appearance as sniper rifles go. All of the major internal working components are naturally housed in the receiver. An ergonomic shoulder stock is set to the rear of the weapon with the barrel ahead of the receiver. The system utilizes a pistol-style grip handle with an integrated trigger system protected within an oblong ring. A forestock is fitted to the lower forend of the receiver. The magazine feed it just ahead of the trigger unit along the bottom face of the receiver. The shoulder stock is constructed of laminated plywood and features a thumbhole, adjustable buttplate and cheek comb for comfort and can mount a carrying handle. A molded fiberglass stock can be substituted for the wood version when ordering. An adjustable bipod is standard as is a rear-set monopod. Loops at the forend and the stock can address the fitting of a shoulder strap for marching.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "6e975441-5769-4e43-ae5d-52dac0347fb7", "year_model": "2018", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov (Dragunov) SVDM", "weapon_type": "Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR) / Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe SVDM is an all-modern evolution of the classic Soviet-era SVD semi-automatic sniper rifle. With the widely-accepted use of the \"Designated Marksman\" in platoon / squad arrangements, the weapon has been categorized as a \"Designated Marksman Rifle\" (DMR) in modern military-speak. It retains much of the form-and-function of the original - including its rifle-caliber chambering, gas operation, and semi-automatic internal action - but has been evolved by way of various tactical finishes including broadened accessories support.\n\r\nThe SVDM is an offshoot of the earlier SVDS which was a version of the SVD rifle reworked to better suit airborne troopers requiring a more compact, lighter weight solution. As such, the stock was redesigned in skeletal / tubular form as a weight-savings measure and this entire assembly could now fold over the rifle's body along a hinge for improved transport. A heavy-duty barrel assembly was also introduced while being capped by a new, shortened flash hider.\n\r\nAs with the SVD before it, the SVDS was chambered in the proven 7.62x54mmR full-power rifle cartridge. The SVDM continues this chambering and brings along with it all of the changes introduced with the SVDS model. It has a heavy-duty barrel assembly of 21.7\" length (supporting a suppressor over the muzzle as needed) and a 1P88-4 telescopic sighting device as standard for daytime operations.\n\r\nThis incarnation of the classic SVD/SVDS rifle retains the general design lines save for it being completed in an all-black matte finish. The frame houses all pertinent operating functions including the charging handle and ejection port set to the right side. The magazine well is ahead of the more ergonomic pistol grip in the traditional way, accepting a curved, 10-round detachable form (the magazine release located just aft of the well). The pistol grip and trigger unit are set in their usual place with the trigger ring being oversized to accommodate a gloved hand. The forend is lightly slotted and shrouds most of the length of the gas assembly which sits over the barrel. The forward sight is positioned at the end of the gas cylinder and works in conjunction with a rear \"iron\" sighting device. The barrel protrudes a distance ahead and is capped by a slotted muzzle brake. A hinged, folding bipod (removable) can be affixed under the forend as a forward support.\n\r\nAt the rear of the frame is a skeletal, adjustable, and padded shoulder stock. As it is hinged, the assembly can be folded over the frame of the rifle for a more compact end-product (useful for when operating in confined spaces or for when \"on-the-march\"). Over the frame is a long-running section of Picatinny rail for the mounting of various optics, magnifiers, and aimers which can serve to enhance accuracy / precision at-range.\n\r\nOverall length of the weapon system is 44.7\" and this is brought down to 38.4\" with the stock folded. Weight is 12lb.\n\r\nAltogether, the SVDM can be a potent ranged weapon in the right hands. Changes have been implemented to make a Soviet-era product better suited to the rigors of the modern battlefield and broaden its tactical appeal.\n\r\nThe rifle entered service with Russian forces in June of 2018 and has been actively used by Russia in their ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

There has always been thought given to expanding the firepower inherent in the infantry squad and this has eventually led to the development of portable machine guns fulfilled by various lightweight systems and \"Squad Automatic Weapons\" - or \"SAWs\". The SAW is unique in that it features the suppression capabilities of a true machine gun yet is chambered for a smaller, assault-style intermediate cartridge (as opposed to a full-powered rifle cartridge). While this reduces engagement ranges and penetration values at range, it provides the infantry squad with a weapon offering voluminous fire - the operator also being able to carry more ammunition into battle.\n\r\nThe \"RPK-16\" is being developed by modern Russian industry to provide a successor for the ages-old RPK-74 series Light Machine Gun (LMG) family of Cold War origin. The RPK-74, based on the Kalashnikov AK-74 assault rifle, was introduced in 1974 and was designed around the 5.45x39mm cartridge.\n\r\nThe RPK-16 follows suit in that it fires the 5.45x39mm intermediate cartridge. The weapon, weighing some six kilograms, is fed by way of a 30-round detachable box magazine or a 96-round hard drum. Overall length is 1,075mm and there are two barrel lengths to suit the mission need - 370mm and 550mm. The weapon ranges out to 800 meters. Sections of Picatinny rail - over the receiver, under the forend and along the sides of the forend - add modern flair and expand the tactical value of the system in allowing installation of various optics fits, a foregrip (or bipod assembly) and other tactical accessories. The muzzle has a slotted flash hider / suppressor and protrudes from under the gas cylinder seated over the barrel. The stock is of a collapsible design (similar in appearance to the AR-15/M16 style) to help decrease the weapon's profile when on-the-march or in close-quarters fighting.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "0a48cec1-7f1d-4383-8f39-8c1d0329fcac", "year_model": "1999", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov SV-99", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian SV-98 sniper was brought about to replace the ages-old SVD series in some Russian agencies. While the SVD series proved a capable long-range sniping platform in its own right, it still maintained origins well-laid in the Cold War years. What modern Russia needed now was a more modern system taking into account the changing face of warfare, Russian doctrine in the post-Cold War world and technological advancements. Thusly, the SV-98 sniper rifle was born.\n\r\nDesign of the SV-98 - under the direction of Vladimir Stronskiy, began in 1998. The design was based on the Izhmash Record-CISM series. After a period of evaluation, serial production followed and was undertaken out of the Izhmash OJSC facilities with service entry of the weapon into the inventories of the Russian special forces - including Spetsnaz- and some police units in 1998.\n\r\nOutwardly, the SV-98 attains a most conventional appearance as sniper rifles go.

The cartridge is based on the 7.62x39mm rifle round though this having its \"neck\" expanded to take on the 9mm bullet - a bullet most commonly found in semi-automatic handguns and submachine guns. The result is a close-quarters weapon with the destructive firepower of a full-length automatic rifle - for the 9x39mm is said to penetrate the latest is body armor while delivering a lower audible signature. Design and manufacture of the 9A-91 was/is the responsibility of the KBP Instrument Design Bureau.\n\r\nDesign of the 9A-91 is quite conventional as automatic weapons go and polymers are utilized for \"non-essential\" components of the gun such as the pistol grip and forward hand guard. This design initiative assists in keeping the weapon's weight to \"manageable\" levels. However, steel stampings are still utilized for construction of the receiver and critical internal components remain metal. The receiver is relatively featureless along the left side of the body while the right side houses the charging handle and ejection port. The 9A-91 features a metal stock that can be folded over the receiver to shorten the weapon's overall length considerably. Optics or accessories can be fitted along the top of the receiver for accurized close-quarters work. The pistol grip is conventional and slight angled rearwards for an ergonomic hold. The grip is integrated with the ring-protected curved trigger element while the trigger sits behind the magazine well. The weapon accepts a straight 20-round detachable box magazine white breaks from the curved magazine tradition of earlier Soviet/Russian assault weapons designs. The firing action is the traditional gas-operation with a rotating bolt unit. The forend is ribbed for a firm hold while only a small length of barrel protrudes ahead. In all, the selected design features promote a rather compact and stout assault weapon suitable for the most serious of police work.\n\r\nThe 9A-91 sports a rate-of-fire in the range of 700 to 900 rounds per minute - on par with many assault rifles. The lower velocity of the 9x39mm subsonic ammunition drastically lowers the effective range of the weapon to under 100 meters. While limited range is a detrimental feature to most any weapon, the type of police work required of elements utilizing a weapon such as the 9A-91 most often times fall within close ranges so the limitation is negligible.\n\r\nThe 9A-91 assault carbine forms the body of the VSK-94 silenced sniper rifle for Russian special forces.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "b7d122fb-2acf-4119-859e-d40e28b36f61", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "KBP AGS-17 Plamya (Flame)", "weapon_type": "30mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AGS-30 is the modern Russian military 30mm automatic grenade launcher for fire support, superseding the Cold War-era AGS-17 \"Plamya\" (\"Flame\").

The weapon provides considerable firepower at the squad level, allowing engagement of direct and indirect targets at both close- and medium-ranges. The system is produced by KBP Instrument Design Bureau of Tula, Russia.\n\r\nThe GM-94 is arranged as a conventional firearm with a standalone pistol grip with trigger unit, shoulder stock, receiver, barrel and magazine. The trigger ring is large enough to allow for a gloved hand to be used. The weapon's overall arrangement follows that of a conventional pump-action shotgun in that the barrel is mated to a tubular magazine holding the grenade projectiles. However, the AN-94 features the magazine over the barrel (as opposed to under) with loading of the weapon managed through a hinged gate found at the top of the receiver (again, as opposed to under). Up to three 43mm projectiles can be stored in the magazine with a fourth projectile made \"ready-to-fire\" in the chamber below. The GM-94 is fielded with a basic steel skeletal shoulder stock that conveniently folds over the receiver for a more compact form when traveling or when forced to action in confined spaces. The folded shoulder stock also doubles as an ad hoc carrying handle when on the march. The barrel is surrounded by a noticeably ribbed casing which provides the forward horizontal grip position while acting as the needed pump-action slide facility. Sighting is through standard fittings across the top of the receiver with a flip-type rear. The weapon weighs in at 4.8 kilograms  and, with a full four-round load, 5.8 kilograms. It is finished in an overall non-reflective black coating.\n\r\nIn practice, the GM-94 is a very portable, lightweight system affording its operator an effective engagement range of 300 meters and maximum engagement range out to 500 meters. Base grenades project a lethal kill radius of 3 meters which safeguards the operator, especially in confined spaces, where the GM-94 allows engagement of a target or area from as little as 10 meters away. The weapon has proven very robust to date and can be fired from wet or dry conditions. Additionally, the availability of various grenade types allows the launcher to be utilized by military and law enforcement elements, the latter by way of tear gas rounds, bean bag slugs and other \"less-than-lethal\" projectiles. For military service, various grenade types are available which provide tactical flexibility against all manner of targets - personnel in close-quarters, dug-in foes and even lightly armored vehicles. However, the system does showcase some detractions including its rather cumbersome size which precludes the operator from having his primary weapon trained at the same time (compared to an underslung launcher fitting). Additionally, there is a considerable amount of recoil noted in the action during firing especially when compared to the smaller 40mm launcher types favored by the West.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4433563e-d061-497a-9e73-6c8025d8b1fb", "year_model": "1996", "weapon_name": "KBP OSV-96", "weapon_type": "Anti-Material Rifle (AMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian OSV-96 is a standard, no-frills large-caliber anti-tank/anti-material precision rifle system of conventional design.

The long-running free-floating barrel is capped by a large slotted muzzle brake to help dampen recoil effects. The firing action revolves around a gas-operation with rotating bolt mechanism and semi-automatic rate-of-fire - allowing the operator to fire off successive shots without manually managing a bolt. The box magazine holds 5 x 12.7x108mm cartridges (equivalent to the 12.7x99mm NATO) while optics are backed by traditional iron sights to maintain ranged capabilities should a scope fail. Overall length of the weapon is 1,746 millimeters with a 1,000 millimeter long barrel assembly and effective range is out to 2,000 meters. The weapon was designed in the 1990s and introduced in 1996, currently seeing service with Russian intelligence and special forces elements and Indian special marine units.\n\r\nThe anti-tank/anti-material rifle is an ever growing heavy weapons category of the modern battlefield. These weapon types can be utilized to attack all manner of lightly-armored or fortified high-value targets or emplacements. Optics allow for precision shooting at distance to the point that the operator can engage key systems on a vehicle (a combat tank for instance) or structure to render them useless. To put the value of large-caliber guns into perspective, these weapon types hold the capability to cut clean through engine blocks at range.\n\r\nAs is the case with most anti-material rifles, the OSV-96 is a dimensionally large and weighty weapon system requiring operation by specially-trained personnel. The weapon is designed to fold at the barrel/receiver for improved portability though its size and weight are still a concern.

The OSV-96 (as with all large-caliber rifles of this breed) gives off a very audible and visual blast effect which, in some cases, may expose the firer's position to the enemy.

This shoulder-fired rocket launcher, considered a flamethrower by Soviet categorization, was designed around use of several rocket types including a primary thermobaric warhead-equipped type (RPO-A). There was also an incendiary rocket introduced (RPO-Z) as well as a general smoke-generating round (RPO-D). The series was introduced during the late 1980s and saw first-actions in the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), both Chechen Wars, and - more recently - in the ongoing Syrian Civil War (beginning 2011) and the War in Donbass (versus Ukraine).\n\r\nThe RPO-A was used to succeed the aging, outgoing line of flame-oriented RPO \"Rys\" launchers then in circulation.\n\r\nThe Shmel continues in service today and fires a 93mm caliber, 700mm long rocket from a shoulder-fired launch tube measuring 920mm out to an effective range of 200 meters.

Design of the weapon began in the 1990s with production ramping up in 1998. Today, the Kord series has replaced the venerable 1970s-era \"NSV\" series in frontline use (itself a replacement for the World War 2-era ubiquitous DShK series) with Russian military forces and has been featured in a variety of roles throughout its relatively short career to date. The Kord Heavy Machine Gun has seen operational use with both Russian police forces as well as the military. Production of all Kord machine guns is handled out of the V.A. Degtyarev Plant in Russia.\n\r\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Army made extensive use of the NSV series of heavy machine guns across various deployments to counter threats from light armored vehicles, concentrations of dug-in enemy troops and low-flying aircraft - particularly helicopters and strike aircraft. From 1990 on, the vast hardships fell across most of the Soviet Union's political, social and economic fronts, forcing an all-out collapse of the empire and independence for its 15 republics. This worked to cut off some of the resources and production facilities the Soviet military had come to rely on as the Russian military budget was also curtailed and development of key systems was either stalled or canceled outright. Much Soviet production of the NSV series happened to center in the region of modern day Kazakhstan so those facilities were effectively dropped in the transition. Throughout the remainder of the decade, renewed Russian authorities charged the famed Degtyarev concern with design and development of a new modern heavy machine gun solution in the same vein as the NSV before it (including use of the Soviet-era 12.7x108mm cartridge, lightweight construction and a higher rate-of-fire). The result was the similarly-appearing Korg family of heavy automatic weapons that has since gone on to become a new Russian military standard - while the NSV continues service with former Soviet-allied nations today. The Korg HMG entered service with Russian forces in 1998 with production still ongoing.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c91a4951-661a-4ee3-b1b1-e8ada935c535", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "KS-23", "weapon_type": "Carbine / Shotgun Assault Weapon", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile displaying an appearance more akin to a shotgun, the Russians designate their KS-23 as a \"Special Carbine\" (KS = \"Karabin Spetsialniy\") due to its large-caliber rifled barrel assembly (unlike conventional shotguns that make use of smoothbore barrels). The KS-23 utilizes a massive 23mm round which has more in common with the Soviet anti-aircraft projectile than a standard shotgun slug. Considering the KS-23 was developed from abandoned anti-aircraft cannon barrels that failed quality control testing, this is not a surprise for the KS-23 was developed as a specialized anti-riot weapon by reconstituting these \"flawed\" 23mm barrels. The size and construction of these barrels proved well-formulated for the use of special, low-powered projectiles and, thusly, the barrels began appearing in a shorter, cut-down form to produce the new \"KS-23\". The Soviet concern of Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod was charged with its production while design was attributed to TsNIITochMashwith development occurring throughout the 1970s. TsNIITochMash is the \"Central Research Institute for Precision Machine Building\" that makes its name as a primary Soviet/Russian military and internal security firearms producer. The KS-23 entered service with Russian police forces in 1985.\n\r\nAt its core, the KS-23 is a manually-actuated, pump-action slide weapon system that, for all intents and purposes, is a \"shotgun\" classification by Western standards though larger in scale by any respect.  The system weighs in at 3.85 kilograms and sports a running length of 1,040mm with a barrel length of 510mm (in her basic form). Her formal caliber is listed as 23mm which becomes 6.27 gauge in American nomenclature while the feed system consists of tubular magazine housed under the barrel. The magazine can only hold 3 x 23mm shells though a fourth round can be chambered \"ready-to-fire\" and increases total ammunition capacity to four. Iron sights are integrated as standard and the internal firing system concerning the 23mm requires use of a multi-lug locking bolt assembly. The KS-23 has seen various shells developed for its unique design including basic buckshot, solid steel slug, non-lethal rubber slugs, tear gas and flash-bang shells. Militarized versions can add the optional muzzle attachment for firing barrel-launched grenades of various types (primarily tear gas for riot control) as well as grapple hooks and the like for special forces elements.\n\r\nThe KS-23 designation identifies the initial production models and basic security-minded KS-23 form. The type sports a 510mm long barrel assembly which differentiates it from the other KS-23 production marks. The militarized version is the KS-23M \"Thrush\" production model which does away with the solid wooden shoulder stock of the base offering and is completed with a handier, shorter 410mm length barrel. Some examples of this model have been identified with or without a wire-type stock. In either case, the KS-23M ends up being lighter in weight and easier to handle as a result. The KS-23K is the KS-23 completely rearranged into a \"bullpup\" configuration (the action now being located aft of the pistol grip and trigger unit) to take advantage of the inherent internal space generated by the required larger shoulder stock . The new arrangement allowed for an internal magazine of up to seven shells as opposed to the three-shell limit of the original production models. The KS-23K appeared in the late 1990s. The KS-23, in its civilian market guise, is known as the TOZ-123 \"Drake\" but is only available in the tree-shell form and banned in some countries.\n\r\nThe KS-23 series has only seen limited use since its inception - no doubt due to the weapon's very specific nature and ammunition. Nonetheless, she remains one of the most powerful - if not the most powerful - \"shotgun\" type systems the world over.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ea8cfb95-be63-432a-be59-791d26d40883", "year_model": "1999", "weapon_name": "KSVK 12.7 (ASVK)", "weapon_type": "Anti-Materiel Rifle (AMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe KSVK 12.7 is a heavy anti-material rifle designed by Russian for specialized Russian Army forces. The weapon is intended for disabling light military vehicles, penetrating fortified enemy positions and counter-sniping duties. Development of this weapon system began at the end of the 1990s under the guidance of ZID, formerly the Degtyarov Plant, makers of World War 2-era anti-material rifles. The Russian Army saw extensive experience in the decade with their two wars against Chechen rebels and the need for a capable and modern anti-material rifle was never more apparent. The KSVK 12.7 was initially known under the designation of ASVK and is based on the earlier SVN-98, an experimental anti-material rifle.\n\r\nThe KSVK 12.7, as its designation suggests, is chambered for the 12.7x108mm cartridge and operates from a manually-actuated bolt-action system that feeds a single round from a spring-loaded, 5-round detachable box magazine. The weapons weighs 12 kilograms sans any optics installations and features a length of 1,400mm with a barrel length of 1,000mm. The rear-fed nature of the magazine (rear of the pistol grip that is) categorizes the KSVK as a \"bullpup\" configured rifle design. Design of the receiver is essentially tubular with a shoulder stock added to the rear for additional support. The shoulder stock features a noticeable ergonomic curve and a bipod is fitted ahead of the receiver as standard. The pistol grip and trigger unit are mounted under the receiver at about the midway point in the design. A long, perforated muzzle brake caps the barrel to help retard the inherent effects of the massive recoil delivered from the firing of the powerful 12.7mm cartridge. The standard rifle design incorporates iron sights for the user but the weapon is designed (by way of an accessories rail) to accept common day/night optics as needed. These optics are fitted just above the pistol grip unit.\n\r\nThe KSVK 12.7 is currently in service with a select group of Russian (and Russian-allied) operators and has seen combat action against Chechen forces - particularly against enemy snipers in the \"counter-sniper\" role.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "fe004cc6-5e32-457e-853b-8d0c3e03c1f3", "year_model": "1951", "weapon_name": "Makarov PM (Pistol Marakova)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Makarov PM (\"Pistolet Makarova\") was designed and developed to replace the Soviet World War 2-era Tokarev TT-33 series semi-automatic pistol. The PM was based on the excellent qualities of the German Walther PP, a family of blow-back operated pistols appearing in 1935 and seeing extensive action throughout World War 2. The type proved of such a most excellent design that it led to both legal and illegal production copies of the type in the decades following its introduction. The Makarov PM was one such illegal copy and entered service in 1951. Despite its 1950s origins, it can still be found in the active Russian inventory as well as in use with other armies worldwide.\n\r\nDesign of the PM was attributed to none other than Nikolay Makarov, a firearms engineer having graduated from the Tula State University. Makarov would go on to claim designs leading to the operational acceptance of the AM-23 cannon, the 9K111 \"Fagot\" man-portable missile launcher and the 9M113 \"Konkurs\" wire-guided missile. However, the Makarov PM would be his first true claim to fame for the Soviet Army. Production of his PM pistol would be handled in the Soviet Union by Izhevsk Mechanical Factory.\n\r\nA design competition was held by Soviet authorities looking to replace the outgoing TT-33 series pistol. Makarov selected the Walther 9mm Ultra round as his starting point and developed his gun around it. The ammunition in the Soviet inventory would take the applicable name of \"9x18mm Makarov\". The 9mm Makarov was similar in some respects to the 9mm Short cartridge with featured a longer casing. This produced a pistol cartridge that proved shorter than the 9mm Parabellum and made for a very unique - if decidedly Soviet - cartridge design overall. This allowed the some level of protection in ensuring that the pistol could only work with Soviet \"in-house\" ammunition and could not be used in numbers against their original owners in a time of full scale war. In the end, the 9mm Makarov was essentially the largest cartridge size applicable to safely firing from the blowback operation system.\n\r\nDesign of the receiver was nothing more than simply following the lines of the original Walther PP pistol but to a slightly larger scale. The pistol measured in at 160mm with a 98mm barrel assembly featuring four grooves and a right-hand twist. The magazine was a spring-loaded 8-round detachable box that was conventionally inserted in through the bottom of the hand grip. Muzzle velocity was rated at 1,070 feet per second and the firing operation was, of course, blowback in nature. The trigger system offered both double-action and single-action operation and effective range was listed out to 50 meters. Some specialized models were later equipped with magazine counts of 10- and 12-rounds. Sighting was accomplished by way of a bladed front and an adjustable notch rear sight. Overall, the PM exhibited very well-countered and clean lines throughout, featuring some vertical ribbing near the main portion of the receiver. The trigger was curved forward and protected in an oblong trigger ring. Safety and other pertinent mechanical functions were set along the left side of the receiver within reach of the operator's thumb. The slide featured slab sides and nicely curved upper and lower surfaces. The rounded hammer spur protruded from the rear of the receiver ever so slightly but was still noticeable. The ejection port was fitted along the right side of the receiver, launching spent shell casings upwards and away from the operator.\n\r\nThe operator initiated the firing action by pulling back on the slide to cock the hammer and introduce a fresh cartridge into the firing chamber. Semi-automatic action occurred after the firing of each round as the pistol was automatically recocked and the chamber reloaded with a fresh cartridge. The operator could then let-off as many rounds as were available. Upon emptying of the magazine, the slide locked open for prevention of subsequent firing and to visibly inform the operator that a reload was required. The empty magazine was released via a release lever at the base of the pistol grip.\n\r\nThe Makarov PM was revised to become the Makarov PMM in 1990. This version elevated the muzzle velocity of the original action. The hand grip was modified for better ergonomics and the firing chamber saw grooves added. A 12-round magazine was also introduced.\n\r\nBeyond manufacture of the gun by IMF, the PM was produced to foreign markets by notable licensed  contributors Ernst Thaelmann / Simson (Suhl) of Germany, Arsenal of Bulgaria and NORINCO of China. Notable operators would go on to include Afghanistan, China (as the Type 59 of 1959), Cuba, East Germany, Georgia, Iraq, Laos, North Korea, Poland, Syria and Ukraine among others.\n\r\nCivilian market versions of the PM soon appeared and similar versions made their way out of both Hungary and Poland. When the Berlin Wall fell in Germany, the unified country had thousands of existing Makarov PM pistols to manage from the joining East German military and security forces.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ffe7ffc2-a572-423a-9392-e004cae07485", "year_model": "1965", "weapon_name": "MON-50", "weapon_type": "Anti-Personnel (AP) Fragmentation Mine", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MON-50 serves the Russian Army, and many other global operators, as an infantry-level Anti-Personnel (AP) mine.

The weapon weighs just two kilograms and has an overall length of 226mm, a width of 35mm, and height of 155mm.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "35ca3ad7-71c1-4658-95d2-172965efda1b", "year_model": "2008", "weapon_name": "MP-443 (Grach)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Military Service Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MP-443 Grach (Mechanical Plant Model 443 - \"Rook\") was adopted by the Russian Army as its standard sidearm in 2003 but useful numbers were not seen until about 2012. It succeeded the ages-old Makarov pistol as standard issue. Criticized for its all-steel construction (adding to its overall weight) and general reliability when compared to proven products like Glock, the MP-443 is nonetheless a powerful handgun and most notable for its firing of an armor-piercing, body-armor-defeating cartridge. During its trial phase, the MP-443 was designated as the \"6P35\". It has since been known as the \"PYa\" as well.\n\r\nThe sidearm is manufactured out of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant and its design stems from Vladimir Yarygin.\n\r\nOrigins of the Grach stem from a 1993 Russian military requirement seeking to replace the limited-capacity Makarov series pistol which saw widespread adoption by military, governmental, special forces and police units. The requirement called for a Double-Action (DA) trigger system and a high-capacity 17-round magazine (an 18-round magazine was introduced in 2004). The all-steel construction was part of the original makeup of the gun and chamberings requested included 9x19mm Parabellum, 9x18mm Makarov and 7.62x25mm Tokarev. The MP-443 followed through on these qualities and settled on the 9x19mm 7N21 +P+ (a 9mm NATO equivalent) pistol cartridge as its primary round.\n\r\nThe action used is the short-recoil (with locked breech) arrangement and sights are fixed out to 50 meters. The sighting combination pairs a front blade with 3-dot reach notch, all fixed. All other mechanical functions of the sidearm are conventional with the slide lock, safety and magazine release all located in their usual positions along the frame of the gun. Magazines are inserted into the base of the grip handle in the usual way.\n\r\nIntroduction of the MP-443 series was agonizingly slow and first occurred with specialist Russian troops around 2008. Serious quantitative production was seen in 2011 leading to increased widespread service of the pistol from 2012 onward.\n\r\nSince its formal introduction, the MP-443 has seen several civilian-market developments appear lead by the MP-446 \"Viking\" model.  This maintains much of the form and function of the military version but does not support firing of armor-piercing cartridges. The MP-446C is an offshoot with a 10-round magazine limit. The MP-353 fires rubber bullets and is classified as a \"non-lethal\" pistol. The MP-472 follows suit as a non-lethal pistol development.\n\r\nBeyond Russia, the Grach pistol line has been adopted by private firms in Kazakhstan (2007).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "af1d2269-4fa0-4073-852c-d9de673c76e1", "year_model": "1971", "weapon_name": "NSV HMG (Utes / Utjos)", "weapon_type": "Heavy Machine Gun / Vehicle Gun", "description": "\r\n        \tFor a time, the NSV multi-purpose heavy machine gun was the standard heavy machine gun of Soviet Army forces. The system was adopted in 1971 to specifically replace the long-running DShK/DShKM series  which debuted just prior to World War 2 (1939-1945) in 1938. Despite adopting the newer design, the breakup of the Soviet Union during the late 1980s/early 1990s meant that the NSV production facilities (and applicable license rights) fell within Kazakhstan territory which essentially signaled the end for the NSV in Russian Army service. Instead, the Russian Army selected the Kord 12.7mm series in its place. Regardless, the NSV continues in Russian Army service (though being replaced with the newer Kord line when possible) while license production of the NVS has been undertaken in Bulgaria, India, Poland, Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia (now Serbia) - ensuring that it remain in circulation for some time to come.\n\r\nThe NSV is chambered for the large 12.7x108mm cartridge, a cartridge capable of piercing light armor protection and literally annihilating a human target to unidentifiable pieces. Such a weapon requires specific tolerances and this, in turn, adds bulk and weight - restricting the weapon to a largely defensive role when mounted onto a heavy duty tripod. If intended for offense - say fixed atop a trainable mounting on a vehicle, watercraft or helicopter as a vehicle gun, the weapon is given more flexibility and mobility. The gun unit alone weighs a hefty 55lb with a 50-round belt adding 25lb. The tripod assembly tips the scales at 90lb which, all told, the complete system can reach weights of 170lb.\n\r\nThe NSV relies on a tried and true gas-operated action in which the arrangement taps gasses of the fired cartridge and channels this into a gas cylinder under the barrel. This pressure, in turn, ingeniously drives the action held within at the receiver, ejecting a spent shell casing while injecting a fresh cartridge. Basically, the fired shot provides the necessary movement and forces required of the successive shot. The weapon is therefore restricted to full-automatic fire meaning that a squeeze of the trigger will result in a consistent intake of ammunition (and firing of bullets from the muzzle) so long as ammunition supplies allow and the trigger remains held down. The weapon is given a rate-of-fire between 700 and 800 rounds per minute which, as an air-cooled weapon, the operator need be aware of barrel overheating. Muzzle velocity is a functional 2,770 feet per second which provides the necessary penetration at range - effective range being approximately 6,500 feet against ground targets (such as an enemy vehicle). The weapon can engage both ground and aerial targets - range against aerial targets limited to about 5,000 feet. For anti-aircraft defense, the weapon can be mounted onto vehicles (such as a tank's turret roof) or on a tripod for a more portable, infantry-level defensive product.\n\r\nThe weapon takes on a conventional appearance with its oversized receiver. Ammunition is fed via 50-round belt from a hardened case affixed to the right side of the receiver. Spent casings a ejected at the left of the receiver. The barrel is unfluted as well as unjacketed though capped by a massive slotted muzzle brake to help content with some of the violent recoil forces at play. The gas cylinder is fitted under the barrel in a rather traditional way. Sighting is through an iron arrangement though the weapon has been coupled to various optical arrangements, particularly when in the anti-aircraft role - though this is largely dependent on the national army in question.\n\r\nBeyond its use in the Russian/Soviet Army, the weapon has also seen acceptance within the inventories of Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland (as the \"12.7 ltkk 96\"), Georgia, India (produced by the Ordnance Factory at Tiruchirappalli), Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Macedonia, Mauritius, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland (as the \"WKM-B\" though in 0.50 BMG form), Serbia (as the \"M87 NSVT\", a vehicle gun by Zastava Arms), Slovenia and Vietnam.\n\r\nSuch a reach has meant that the weapon has gone on to see consistent frontline service in several high-profile wars and regional conflicts including the 1980s Soviet-Afghan War, 1991 Gulf War and the 2001 and 2003 US-led invasions spawning Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "bbebfb54-5df5-4d48-8d9a-0bffbfd6fffd", "year_model": "2011", "weapon_name": "ORSIS T-5000", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian SV-98 sniper was brought about to replace the ages-old SVD series in some Russian agencies.

What modern Russia needed now was a more modern system taking into account the changing face of warfare, Russian doctrine in the post-Cold War world and technological advancements. Thusly, the SV-98 sniper rifle was born.\n\r\nDesign of the SV-98 - under the direction of Vladimir Stronskiy, began in 1998. The design was based on the Izhmash Record-CISM series. After a period of evaluation, serial production followed and was undertaken out of the Izhmash OJSC facilities with service entry of the weapon into the inventories of the Russian special forces - including Spetsnaz- and some police units in 1998.\n\r\nOutwardly, the SV-98 attains a most conventional appearance as sniper rifles go. All of the major internal working components are naturally housed in the receiver. An ergonomic shoulder stock is set to the rear of the weapon with the barrel ahead of the receiver. The system utilizes a pistol-style grip handle with an integrated trigger system protected within an oblong ring. A forestock is fitted to the lower forend of the receiver. The magazine feed it just ahead of the trigger unit along the bottom face of the receiver. The shoulder stock is constructed of laminated plywood and features a thumbhole, adjustable buttplate and cheek comb for comfort and can mount a carrying handle. A molded fiberglass stock can be substituted for the wood version when ordering. An adjustable bipod is standard as is a rear-set monopod. Loops at the forend and the stock can address the fitting of a shoulder strap for marching.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "31ae6734-ef7c-44b5-b622-96606c70d82a", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "PFM-1", "weapon_type": "Anti-Personnel Mine", "description": "\r\n        \tWarfare inherently has many ugly sides with one of the ugliest being measures that do not discriminate between friend or foe, military or civilian targets. The anti-personnel mine falls under this description, designed to maim or outright kill through its detonation, the blast effect or fragments proven utterly lethal against those unfortunate enough to be within its zone. Despite an international effort to ban such battlefield measures since 1997, the anti-personnel mine continues to see widespread use in warfare today (2023).\n\r\nDuring the Cold War between East and West, the Soviets developed a new generation of anti-personnel mine which became the \"PFM-1\" - no doubt influenced by the American Army's BLU-43 \"Dragontooth\" anti-personnel mine series used in Laos during Operation Igloo White as part of the Vietnam War (1965-1975). This winged, plastic-bodied device was designed as a cost-effective solution that could be set by ground forces or air-dropped via aircraft / helicopter through cassette containers - the \"winged\" design of the mine helping to retard the mine's fall.\n\r\nThe mine's design is wholly utilitarian by nature, intended to be produced in quantity as cheaply as possible while promoting the most \"value\" as an anti-personnel solution. Arming is by way of safety pin removal to which a spring in actuated until contacting the detonator component - detonation being handled by any external changes to the exterior plastic body of the mine making it extremely sensitive even for trained handlers. Disarming is impossible.\n\r\nPFM-1 marked the original production models which arrived in a very identifiable green coloring - the coloring meant for better concealment on the expected European battlefields of the Cold War period. The PFM-1S followed as a variant. Initial use was in the Soviet-Afghan War where the mine's green bodies were easily noticeable against the dry, desert environment of the Afghan battlefield.\n\r\nThe sheer quantity of mines produced has ensured their place even in the modern Russian inventory - where forces have taken to its use (alongside other design types) in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War (2022-Present).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "58966b26-6e28-4248-9a62-f6abfb1f95e6", "year_model": "2001", "weapon_name": "PKP Pecheneg (6P41)", "weapon_type": "General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tIn 1961, the Soviet Army began wide-scale adoption of the PK General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) which utilized the tried-and-true 7.62mm Russian rifle cartridge through a belt-fed mechanism and gas-operated system. It was adopted beyond the Soviet realm by political and military allies to become a permanent, and rather lethal, fixture in the wars to follow - Vietnam, Yom Kippur, Iran-Iraq, the Chechen wars among others. Amazingly, the PK family line has withstood the test of time to remain in wide-reaching use today and has since been modernized through the \"PKM\" form.\n\r\nAt the turn of the century, the Russian military began evaluation of a new, modernized machine gun form intended to serve in the squad-level role. As such, the design would become highly portable and intended for true suppression effect. The design was headed by TsNIITochMash and the weapon came to be known as the PKP \"Pecheneg\". It was then formally adopted for frontline use in 2001. Granted the military designation of 6P41, it has since seen service with the Russian Army and SPETSNAZ special forces while adopted in varying degrees by Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\r\nAt its core, the PKP remains a gas-operated machine gun system capable of full-automatic fire while being fed by way of 100-, 200- or 250-round belt magazines held in a hard box under the receiver. It retains use of the same 7.62x54R cartridge seen in the PK/PKM and features a rate-of-fire reaching 600 to 800 rounds-per-minute. Muzzle velocity is 2,700 feet per second while effective firing ranges reach out to 1,500 meters.\n\r\nOutwardly, the PKP showcases a workmanlike appearance with a solid, rectangular receiver in an all-black finish. The receiver naturally houses the critical internal working components of the action including the feed mechanism and firing chamber. There is a lightweight, skeletal stock for support at the shoulder and the barrel sits above the gas cylinder at front. Iron sights are provided though optics can be affixed as required. An integrated carrying handle is useful for quick relocation of the unit. A standard fixture at the barrel is a folding bipod assembly. Sling loops allow a shoulder strap to be used which is a must for quick-moving infantry. An ergonomic pistol grip handle and easy-reach trigger group provide a familiar operational functionality to the weapon. Unlike other GPMGs, the PKP does not feature a \"quick-change\" barrel facility for in-the-field management of a hot barrel. Instead, the assembly is designed with a forced-air, air-cooled arrangement.\n\r\nOverall weight of the PKP (with its bipod affixed) is approximately 8.7 kilograms. It features an overall length of 47 inches while the barrel assembly measures some 26 inches long. When affixed with a night vision device, the 6P41 becomes known as the \"6P41N Pecheneg-N\". Other designations include the Pecheneg \"Bullpup\" which is a reworked form to the bullpup configuration, retaining its full-length barrel and containing the action/magazine feed to the rear of the trigger group. The Pecheneg-2 is considered an \"improved\" based on the original Pecheneg model and is currently (2014) in the development phase.\n\r\nThe PKP has recently seen combat actions in the Russian takeover of Crimea by Army and special forces elements.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "47ccdc05-ac82-4231-97e1-92a710fbdf57", "year_model": "2022", "weapon_name": "PPSH Labs LPD-801", "weapon_type": "Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe LPD-801 is a Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) designed, developed, and manufactured by Russia.

The RG-6 sports a Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger set with enlarged loop to support a gloved hand and can sustain a rate-of-fire up to 18 rounds per minute. Grenades are housed in a six-shot rotating cylinder which swings out for reloading. Unlike Western repeat-fire grenade launchers (which load through the breech end) , the RG-6 is loaded through the muzzle end of the cylinder chambers. A spring used to rotate the cylinder is then manually wound prior to firing. Another unique facet of the cylinder's design is that each chamber is rifled and the barrel left as smoothbore. Thusly, the chambers themselves impart the necessary rotation upon the exiting projectile (as opposed to the barrel). \r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d8efb722-4c4d-4b7f-bb0a-9e5a6643aec2", "year_model": "1990", "weapon_name": "RGN (Ruchnaya Granata Nastupatelnaya)", "weapon_type": "Fragmentation Hand Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RGN (\"Ruchnaya Granata Nastupatel'naya\") is a basic, standardized fragmentation hand grenade of Soviet origin.

It entered notable service in 2004 and has seen combat exposure in the current War in Donbass against Russian elements and separatists.\n\r\nThe gun is manufactured locally by state-owned RPC Fort, founded in 1991 and headquartered in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. Production is ongoing as of this writing (2020).\n\r\nThe pistol is typically seen and operated through the widely-available 9mm chambering, a proven man-stopped the world over and making for a more manageable sidearm in terms of accuracy. The internal action is of Double-Action (DA), semi-automatic function, allowing one pull/squeeze of the trigger to fire the gun and introduce a new cartridge into the chamber while ejecting the spent case. During this quick action, the slide is managed rearwards and resets over the receiver in the usual way. Feeding is by way of a 13-round spring-loaded detachable box magazine fitted into the hollowed out grip. Muzzle velocity is rated at 325 meters-per-second. Overall length reaches 180mm with the barrel measuring 95mm. Weight is 810 grams loaded (680 grams otherwise).\n\r\nSights are set over the receiver, one component at the rear and the other nearer the muzzle for approximate placement of the bullet at range. The slide features ribbing along its sides for a surer grip when managing the slide assembly manually (such as in the initial cocking action). A safety mechanism is set at the slide towards the rear (near the thumb) and the exposed hammer protrudes from the rear of the assembly. The magazine-release button is situated near the trigger, giving quick access to the system for reloading, while the trigger itself sits within an uninterrupted ring which is oversized to accommodate a gloved hand. The grip's backstrap is removable/replaceable for some customization of the pistol.\n\r\nThe Fort-17 family line currently (2020) includes the base design as the \"Fort-17\". This model is chambered in the 9x18mm PM (Makarov) pistol cartridge. The Fort-17 Curz uses the 9mm \"Kurz\" (.380 ACP) cartridge while the \"Kobra\" is a sport shooter utilizing the Makarov catridge.

These relatively simplistic weapons have proven both easy to train with and easy to operate meaning any able-bodied person can be made lethal in its use. The weapons are an economic measure that is ideal against enemy armor, light vehicles, and fortified enemy positions. The RPG line grew out of the Cold War period (1947-1991) with the original RPG-2 and went on to produce the classic RPG-7 and modern incarnations in the RPG-18 \"Mukha\", RPG-22 \"Netto\", and RPG-29 \"Vampir\".\n\r\nThe RPG-22, the focus of this article, was evolved from the earlier RPG-18 and appeared in 1985 as the Soviets were embroiled in their war in Afghanistan. As with other Soviet-era weapons, this system has managed to remain a viable solution on the modern battlefield - even today. In both form and function, the RPG-22 is comparable to the American M72 LAW (detailed elsewhere on this site) and, like the M72, the Soviet model is disposable after firing, limiting it to single-use functionality.\n\r\nThe RPG-22 fires a High-Explosive, Anti-Tank (HEAT) round by way of a 72.5mm projectile out to ranges of 200 meters. Maximum range is 250 meters as the sighting device is pre-marked at stages for ranging out to 50m, 150m, and 250m. The weapon is rated against Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA), concrete, and brick targets making it an ideal multi-purpose weapon. Furthermore, its lightweight (2.8kg) and compact footprint (785mm collapsed, 850mm extended) means that it can be carried over the shoulder of each infantryman or a single infantryman can carry multiple tubes ready-to-fire. The launcher is readied in seconds with the tube extended, flip-up sights engaged, and the trigger pulled. As the exiting projectile is inherently unguided (simply stabilized by spring-loaded fins), the rocket is prone to accuracy issues the farther out the target resides. Cocking the weapon is done by simply raising the rear sight, the operator needing only to lower the sight to de-cock.\n\r\nThe launch tube if of weight-savings fiberglass construction and, internally, it has a smoothbore design housing the rocket grenade. Caps are affixed at both ends of the launch tube when in transport and the telescoping section of tube slides over the fixed, primary cylindrical assembly making up the launcher.\n\r\nAs with any shoulder-fired weapon of this type, the launch tube exhausts its propellant directly aft of the operator meaning anything in the back-blast is in danger. As such, this limits the weapon's usage some when firing from cover such as from a building's window. Once fired, the launch tube is discarded allowing the infantryman to freely move with less weight to carry.\n\r\nDespite its age, the RPG-22 series continues active use with the armed forces of Russia as well as many former Soviet allies, supported states, and aligned export customers including Bulgaria (including local production), Croatia, Georgia, India, Iraq, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.\n\r\nIt has more recently seen use in the Ukrainian-Russian War of 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "5d671209-b154-4b64-8da4-bd4e14d4f3e4", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "RPG-26", "weapon_type": "Disposable Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPG-26 (Rocket Propelled Grenade 26) was developed as a single-shot, disposable anti-tank battlefield solution for the Red Army during the Cold War.

The rocket was designed with spring-actuated stabilizing fins that emerged once the rocket cleared the launch tube upon firing. Penetration was made possible by the shaped-charge warhead to which some 440mm of armor thickness could be penetrated at effective ranges within 250 meters. In addition to its anti-armor function, the weapon could also be used to engage fortified structures as required.

In this manner, the operator could carry several of the weapons (typically three) into combat and \"lighten the load\" as the battle progressed. Examples of this form were the RPG-18, RPG-22, RPG-26, and - the focus of this article - the RPG-27.\n\r\nThe man-portable disposable weapon was a technically sound battlefield solution. It involved a two-piece launch tube that could collapse on itself for ease-of-transport (with the ready rocket already inside) and was extended to the fullest when made ready-to-fire. Aiming could be done either through iron sights or optics if integrated depending on the design. The result was an AT measure that, if the rocket's warhead allowed, could repel any modern tank of the day. In the West, this role eventually fell to the M72 \"Light Anti-tank Weapon\" - or \"LAW\" among other tank-killers.\n\r\nOriginating as an evolved form of the earlier RPG-26 series, the larger-diameter RPG-27 centered on a fin-stabilized, rocket-propelled projectile (tandem-charge HEAT warhead) of 105mm caliber and rated against Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) (750mm), Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) blocks (add-on armor protection), concrete / fortified (1,500mm), and earth (3,700mm). The rockets reached a muzzle velocity of 120 meters-per-second when exiting the launch tube and effective range was out to 200 meters with aiming handled by way of iron sights (as such, accuracy was reduced the further away the target was). Overall weight of the complete unit was 7.6 kilograms with an overall, extended length of 1,155mm.\n\r\nThe RPG-27 saw design work take place during the 1980s under the direction of the State Research and Production Enterprise (Bazalt) and production - along with service entry into the Soviet inventory - began in 1989. In time, variants included the thermobaric warhead \"RShG-1\" (\"Reaktivnaya Shturmovaya Granata\") for lighter-armored targets and the multirole, bunker-busting \"RMG\" (\"Reaktivnaya Mnogotselevaya\") offshoots.\n\r\nDespite its lengthy battlefield career, the RPG-27 could only ever count the Soviet Union and ally Jordan as its global operators. The in-service stocks of launchers then fell to the reborn Russian Army with the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1989-1991.\n\r\nIt is believed that the RPG-27 has been actively used by Russian forces in its was against neighboring Ukraine following Russia's invasion of February 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "55b0e110-50f3-4500-bebd-44f184c5560e", "year_model": "2011", "weapon_name": "RPG-28 Klyukva (Cranberry)", "weapon_type": "Shoulder-Fired Disposable Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tPortable, shoulder-fired armor-defeating weapons have been a staple of Russian military units since the dark days of World War 2 (1939-1945). Technique and technology both evolved during the Cold War decades which produced a variety of such weapons in the \"RPG\" mold, generally firing a rocket-propelled armor-defeating grenade. These weapon systems have proven utterly reliable, effective and easy-to-operate / train on, making them a popular choice for guerilla fighters able to get their hands on the weapons.\n\r\nThe RPG-28 fits this same mold - it is a shoulder-fired weapon designed to be carried and fired by a single individual with effectiveness against armored targets and fortified positions. The launcher unit sports integrated optics for sighting targets at range and is wholly disposable once the rocket has been fired. It can be carried by a single infantryman or mounted on a tripod assembly for ambushing passing armor. The launcher comes preloaded with the projectile which weighs 12 kilograms and features spring-loaded fins for stabilized flight to the target. The rocket has an effective range out to 300 meters with penetration against 1,000mm of Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA).\n\r\nDesign work on the RPG-28 was handled by the State Research and Production Enterprise and Bazalt and both are involved in its ongoing production (since 2008). The RPG-28 series was introduced in late-2011 and currently (2017) sees service with the Russian military. It is known as the \"Klyukva\" - or \"Cranberry\".\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "92290905-eb9d-4e77-a245-f285a90c1ac9", "year_model": "1989", "weapon_name": "RPG-29 Vampir (Vampire)", "weapon_type": "Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the dark days of World War 2, Russia (then the lead of the Soviet Union) has held a high regard for man-portable, tank-killing systems.

The result was the \"RPG-32\" based on the existing RPG-29. Russia has long held an expertise with inexpensive anti-tank devices going as far back as World War 2 during their bloody conflict with Germany and the Axis powers. The RPG-32 became, in many ways, a culmination of the many successes of previous designs which included the world-renowned RPG-7 (which Bazalt continues to produce). The RPG-32 entered service in 2008 and is utilized by the armies of Iraq, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The \"Hashim\" designator sometimes seen is applied by the Jordanian Army in reference to the Arab Hashemite dynasty of centuries past. Jordan supplied initial financing of the RPG-32 initiative and its engineers played a role in the final design.\n\r\nAt its core, the RPG-32 is a rocket-propelled grenade launcher in much the same vein as the RPG-7 before it though featuring a much lighter launcher and more capable rocket element. The system consists of the launch tube which, in itself, integrates the optics and trigger mechanism. The rocket grenade is provided through a pre-fabricated casing that is inserted at the rear of the tube prior to firing. The optical sight is managed from the left side of the launch tube with the trigger unit along the right. As with the earlier RPG developments, little preparation is required to make the RPG-32 ready and little training is required in its use - making it popular amongst many operators. The RPG-32 launcher is of 105mm caliber though it can fire from an ammunition stock of both 105mm (15.4lbs) and 72mm rocket types. There are two recognized rockets available - the \"PG-32V\" tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) and the \"TBG-32V\" Thermobaric Fragmentation Anti-Armor (TFAA). The former is listed with a penetration up to 650mm (25 inches) and a muzzle velocity of 460 feet per second with an effective range out to 2,300 feet. Rockets are delivered from the factory in a disposable case which is affixed to the rear of the reusable launch tube.\n\r\nThe RPG-32 is said to be capable of defeating the base armor of present-day Main Battle Tanks while the warhead is suitable against other target types including fortified structures. The launcher is purposely designed to be man-portable and is fired from the shoulder in the usual way. Firing from within buildings is, of course, restricted to an extent due to the violent back-blast of such weapons in confined spaces. Launchers weigh 3 kilograms (sans projectile) and their value is limited only by the ammunition supply on hand. Common practice is an RPG carrier with 3 x rocket grenades in a specially-devised backpack alongside his primary automatic weapon. As the projectile is a true \"rocket grenade\" and not a homing/guided missile, the projectile is essentially a \"point-and-shoot\" weapon without any guidance provided to the rocket after launch. This helps to keep procurement costs down substantially while providing for a very modern armor-penetrating system for discerning customers. According to company sources, a single launcher is rated for the firing of 200 rockets.\n\r\nIt is believed that local license production of the launchers and rockets are handled in Argentina, Brazil, Jordan and Mexico. Such manufacture of a local solution was one of the initial project goals concerning the RPG-32.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d4b0958c-aba2-491b-942a-b8221fbe5a98", "year_model": "1961", "weapon_name": "RPG-7", "weapon_type": "Rocket-Propelled Grenade (RPG) Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPG-7 (\"Ruchnoy Protivotankoviy Granatomet\") was the follow-up in the family of Soviet-originated \"RPG\" man-portable, shoulder-fired, anti-tank rocket launchers (generically referred to as \"RPGs\"). The Soviet design could trace its roots back to the American \"Bazooka\" and German \"Panzerfaust' launchers of World War 2 and many examples of these weapons came into the hands of Soviet troopers throughout the conflict. The RPG-7, like those rocket projecting systems before it, was devised as an inexpensive and easy-to-produce and operate, one-man, single-shot weapon for the purpose of defeating armor at range. Despite its 1961 introduction, the system maintains a faithful following and its production reach has meant that the weapon continues to see frontline service in a plethora of modern conflicts. Its qualities are such that the series is a favorite of organized national armies as well as rebels and guerrilla fighters the world over.\n\r\nThe RPG-7 is a further development of past RPG variations - from the earlier RPG-2, RPG-3 and RPG-4 rocket projectors - and can fire a variety of warhead types including FRAG (FRAGmentation), HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) and HE (High-Explosive) rounds. The FRAG projectile is a 4lb munition relying on 210 grams of A-IX-1 explosive. There are two major HEAT projectiles in the PG-7VL single-stage and PG-7VR tandem charge. The former weighs 5.7lb and the latter 9.9lb. Diameter is 93mm and 64mm respectively and these munitions can penetrade between 500mm and 750mm of Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA). The TBG-7V is a thermobaric projectile of 9.9lb weight with a listed caliber of 105mm.\n\r\nOverall weight of the weapon is 15lb and overall length is 950mm (37.4 inches) making the system both lightweight and compact to carry. Grenades leave the muzzle at 115 meters per second and effective ranges are out to 200 meters (maximum achievable range is 920 meters). Sighting is through traditional static iron sights but optics are also supported as is a red dot reflex sighting device. At about 50 meters, the operator can achieve hit probability as high as 100% though this drops to half that at about 200 meters away from the target (of course many factors influence accuracy). Its effectiveness is not necessarily in the ability to stop light-armored vehicles but also to provide shock value to dug-in enemy troops.\n\r\nThe RPG-7 is an inherently compact weapon and paratrooper versions are designed to be broken down into major components for better travel. It provides generally lightly-armed troopers with necessary firepower to stop vehicles on approach or unseat defenders. The resulting \"back blast\" of the firing rocket is relatively minimal and this allows the RPG to be fired from enclosed spaces such as buildings and from covered outdoor positions. Its operation is also quite basic, requiring little training on the part of the user, which lends itself well to rebel forces and other less-organized fighters. Despite its sheer simplicity, the influence of the RPG-7 on the battlefield cannot be overstated.\n\r\nThe modern Russian Army relies on the modernized form of the weapon as the \"RPG-7V2\" and its paratrooper counterpart is the \"RPG-7D3\".\n\r\nOver 9,000,000 examples of the RPG-7 have been produced since 1961 by Bazalt, Degtyarev and others. It is locally manufactured in no fewer than a dozen countries and can be found in the military inventories of nearly forty nations worldwide - from Afghanistan and Albania to Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Chinese version is designated \"Type 69\" and Vietnam knows it as the \"B-41\". For Sudan, the weapon is the \"Sinar\" and is produced by the Military Industry Corporation. Bulgaria designates their stock as \"ATGL-L\".\n\r\nAirtronic of the United States fabricates the weapon as the \"RPG-7USA\" and this is a modern incarnation of the weapon complete with accessories rail, flip-up sights, and extended service life.\n\r\nFormer operators include East Germany, Rhodesia, and Yugoslavia. Comparable weapon systems in the West are the American M72 LAW, German Panzerfaust 3, and Israeli B-300.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d1f69f81-e0f9-4f41-9547-930a64e07c52", "year_model": "1974", "weapon_name": "SA-14 (Gremlin) / 9K34 Strela-3", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile", "description": "\r\n        \tDue to the limited capabilities of its preceding 9K32 \"Strela-2\" (NATO: SA-7 \"Grail\") anti-aircraft missile system, the Soviet military commissioned for an improved form which became the 9K34 \"Strela-3\" (NATO: SA-14 \"Gremlin\").  The missile was given more reliable infrared homing seeker which made it less prone to fall for launched countermeasures by aircraft. The system was produced by KBM and introduced into the Soviet Army inventory in 1974. Despite its Cold War origins, the weapon continues widespread use today, proving an effective battlefield man-portable, shoulder-launched system. A navalized form has been recognized by NATO as the \"SA-N-8\".\n\r\nThe 9K34 followed along the same design lines as previous man-portable, shoulder-launched offerings. The system consisted of a slim launch tube with attached powerpack, trigger group and grip and optics. The missile resided in the launch tube until firing to which it would break free of its hold and head for the target at Mach speeds, spring-loaded fins providing the necessary stabilization and course correction. Overall length of the launch tube was just under five feet. The missile (heavier than the Strela-2 before it) maintained a speed of up to 1,500 kilometers per hour and could reach targets as high as 7,500 feet with accuracy (accuracy improved considerably at lower altitudes. Upon impact, the Strela-3 missile could do enough damage to critical components to take an aircraft down. The Strela-3 could also engage aircraft from the front and sides with some success.\n\r\nThe 9K34 system has seen extensive service in armies worldwide since its inception. It was fielded by Iraqi forces during the 1991 Gulf War which saw a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Panavia Tornado brought down by the type. The weapon has also seen use in the Georgian-Russian engagements as well as the Bosnia War. The 9K34 has also proven prevalent across many localized operations on the African continent where access to Soviet goods has always proven easy. One of the most recognized instances of a 9K34 missile engaging an aircraft was on November 22nd, 2003 when a DHL Airbus A300 cargo aircraft was damaged by a Streola-3 missile shortly after taking-off from Baghdad International Airport. While damaged along the trailing edge of its portside wing and loss of hydraulic power, the aircraft managed to circle back and land safely for assessment and repair.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "19d6ea83-557a-4815-bcb2-bc1d89946dd8", "year_model": "1981", "weapon_name": "SA-16 (Gimlet) / 9K310 Igla-1", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9K310 \"Igla-1\" (NATO: SA-16 \"Gimlet\") was designed, developed and produced alongside the improved, and technologically superior, 9K38 \"Igla\" (NATO: SA-18 \"Grouse\") man-portable, shoulder-launched anti-aircraft system. Both series entered service with the Soviet Army in 1983 and continue widespread use today (2013). Production is managed by KBM of Koloma, Russia.\n\r\nThe 9K310 and 9K38 series received their origins in a Soviet initiative to improved upon previous ground-launched, portable anti-aircraft weapons including the SA-7 and SA-14 families which made use of the Strela-2 and Strela-3 missiles respectively. The primary limitation of the preceding series was their consistent unreliability particularly when facing aircraft countermeasures. As the new program developed, it was decided to produce two distinct missile forms - a short-term, improved solution in the 9K310 and the longer-term, more advanced 9K38. The 9K310 was assigned the Igla-1 missile system with sported an improved homing and guidance suite.\n\r\nThe 9K310 inherited the same form and function of preceding Soviet anti-aircraft missile launching marks.

The weapon was adopted by the Soviet military in 1983 and retained by the modern Russian military after the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991. The SA-18 is classified a short-to-medium-range anti-aircraft counter for threats posed by low-flying aircraft such as fixed-wing strike platforms and attack helicopters. Production of the weapon is handled through the KBM bureau of Kolomna, Russia.\n\r\nDesign origins of the SA-18 can be traced back to an early 1970s initiative intended on producing a modern, more effective and portable anti-aircraft measure for the Soviet Army beyond the scope of theexisting SA-7 and SA-14 systems then in use. The program eventually evolved into two distinct product goals which produced the interim-minded (and technologically simpler) 9K310 \"Igla-1\" (NATO: \"SA-16\") and the more advanced 9K38 \"Igla\" (NATO: \"SA-18\"). The SA-18 launcher appeared as a follow-up to the SA-14 family though with an all-new missile development. The overall design of the weapon was conventional, including a sleek tubular launch tube which was set over the operator's shoulder when fired. When transported, the system was afforded a shoulder strap. The powerpack, trigger unit with pistol grip and optics are all contained at the frontal section of the launcher. \n\r\nThe SA-18 was adopted into Red Army service in 1983 (the SA-16 in 1981). A major modernization then produced the latest Igla incarnation recognized as \"Igla-S\" (NATO: SA-24 \"Grinch\"). A navalized form of the SA-18 is known to NATO as the SA-N-10 \"Grouse\".\n\r\nThe 9M39 series missile relied on a two-color infrared guidance system (minimizing vulnerability to flares deployed by targeted aircraft) and was propelled by a single solid fuel rocket motor. The missile managed an operational range out to 3.2 miles and could operate at ceilings of 11,000 feet while reaching speeds in the neighborhood of Mach 2.3. The lethal payload of the missile consisted of a 2.6lb warhead detonation reached by both contact and fuse. The missile was nearly as long as the launch tube itself and sported spring-loaded fins for in-flight stabilization after launch. With its new seeker, the missile now held an inherently longer effective range as well as improved engagement speeds. Perhaps the most noticeable improvement came from its self-protection against the latest in electro-optical jamming equipment. As such, the missile could manage a probable kill value as high as 48% against an unsuspecting, unprotected aircraft.\n\r\nThe SA-18 is utilized by a plethora of world powers with many owing procurement to close Soviet-Russian relations of the Cold War.

This solution is capable of dealing with both fixed-wing and rotary-wing threats (including unmanned drones) at range, its tactical value maximized when fired from concealment (as in an ambush action).\n\r\nBeyond its man-portable quality, the weapon can also be affixed to vehicles and naval vessels to provide point-defense capabilities against inbound aerial threats.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "294a31a9-4f3d-4ef0-ae03-3feacc18f370", "year_model": "1968", "weapon_name": "SA-7 (Grail) / 9K32 Strela-2", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable SAM System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe SA-7 (NATO designation of \"Grail\" or Soviet designation of \"Strela-2\") is a MANPAD system - a portable shoulder launched anti-aircraft weapon system. The lethality of such a system lies in the mobility of the firer to seemingly 'pop up' at opportune times and strike at low-flying aircraft. The effect of such an element is two fold as it forces the targeted aircraft to fly above and beyond the range of the weapon, exposing it to the hazards of enemy radar or more potent surface-to-air defenses. Should the aircraft continue to fly within the range of a weapon like the Grail, it carries the greater calculated risk of being brought down from a smaller enemy below or behind the aircraft.\n\r\nSimilar in many respects to the American Redeye surface-to-air missile system, the SA-7 Grail has proven most accurate against low-flying aircraft and helicopters with the only major drawback being that the missile, once fired, must be trained in on a consistent heat source to score a kill. The weapon maintains a hit percentage of roughly 90%, though the HE (High Explosive) warhead is said to not accomplish much in the way of overall damage - as proven in some instances where damaged Israeli fighters were able to return to friendly airbases after receiving direct hits from Grail ground detachments during the Arab-Israeli War of 1973.\n\r\nNevertheless, the system can still be considered deadly in the event that critical systems are destroyed or damaged - in an aircraft that could be the cockpit, avionics or engine components and in rotary aircraft, that could be the cockpit, the tail rotor assembly or main rotor assembly.

The cartridge was developed in the 1980s with the need to arm special operations units with a more powerful subsonic round under low velocity. The cartridge has since been introduced into a full line-up of Soviet/Russian weapons including the impressive AS \"Val\" and VSS \"Vintorez\" silenced assault/sniper (respectively) rifles. One of the unique qualities of the SR-3 itself is the very compact form that the base weapon takes on (more akin to a submachine gun than an assault rifle). This makes it highly suitable for special forces use as well as airborne infantry. Production of the SR-3 has been undertaken out of the famous Tula Arms Plant to which a modified form - the silenced SR-3M - has since emerged.\n\r\nThe SR-3 is a conventional gas-operated weapon utilizing a rotating bolt action. The received is slab-sided and rectangular in its general shape with a conventional pistol-grip/trigger unit and forward hand guard around the barrel/gas system. It sports a rate-of-fire of approximately 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 970 feet per second. The weapon is generally effective within ranges of 200 meters but can be used beyond to approximately 400 meters. There are two known versions of the SR-3, the extended design being the aforementioned \"SR-3M\". The base SR-3 production model is fed by way of a 20-round detachable curved box magazine while the modified SR-3M is seen with a 30-round magazine. Iron sites are provided for base accuracy. The SR-3 features a collapsing stock which folds over the receiver and forward hand guard. The SR-3M accepts a sound suppressor (fully removable) and features a vertical foregrip under a revised hand guard as well as a skeletal folding buttstock. Optics for this model are optional.\n\r\nThe SR-3 weighs in at 2 kilograms while the SR-3M is 3.2 kilograms. Overall length is 640mm for the SR-3 and 970mm for the SR-3M. In either form, the barrel remains 156mm in length.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c462192e-8dfb-44f4-b806-96ffc6aca9f9", "year_model": "1951", "weapon_name": "Stechkin APS (Automatic Pistol Stechkin)", "weapon_type": "Selective-Fire Service Pistol / Machine Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tIt has always been something of a challenge to equip logistical, special role and second-line troops in warfare. The role is typically taken up by the submachine gun but there are times when an even handier, portable assault weapon is required. During the Cold War (1947-1991) between the East and the West, the Soviet Union sought to solve this issue within their ranks and called on local industry to develop a new close-quarters weapon. One entry into this competition became the Stechkin, an automatic pistol with qualities more akin to a machine pistol - the bridge between a semi-automatic handgun and a submachine gun. The Stechkin's formal name was \"Avtomaticheskiy Pistolet Stechkina\" or \"APS\", this literally translating to \"Automatic Pistol Stechkin\".\n\r\nIgor Stechkin was credited with the design of the pistol, hence it bears his name, and work began in the late-1940s and continued into the early-1950s.\n\r\nAt the core of the design was a blowback system of operation which centered on the 9x18mm Makarov Soviet pistol cartridge. The pistol had a selective-fire capability and could reach out, with some accuracy, to 655 feet while maintaining a rate-of-fire of 750 rounds-per-minute. Muzzle velocity of the outgoing bullet reached 1,115 meters-per-second. To promote better accuracy while in full-automatic fire, there was an optional solid shoulder stock attached to the base of the grip. Sighting was through an iron arrangement and the sidearm more or less mimicked in appearance the various John Browning-inspired semi-automatic service pistols of the period.\n\r\nAfter official evaluations and trials, this automatic pistol was formally adopted for service in 1951. Serial production was had through the Vytatsky Polyany Machine-Building Plant. Production of the APS pistol spanned from 1951 until 1958 and issuance was to vehicle and artillery crews as well as some officer-level candidates. Security forces soon took up the type and it was offered up for sale on the foreign market where takers were aplenty.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "85b3f8c5-06f3-4855-a715-3d0f5ef26921", "year_model": "2022", "weapon_name": "Tecmash AGS-40 (Balkan)", "weapon_type": "Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe grenade launcher has been a fixture of the modern battlefield for some time and has proven itself a terrifying suppression and psychological weapon. It finds itself in the active inventories of many armies today and is the perfect counter to stubborn, dug-in enemy personnel. Modern-day systems are capable of select-fire, indirect fire, and can be coupled with assault rifles, fired from portable tripods, vehicle mounts, and from moving aircraft - such is their versatility.\n\r\nDuring the Cold War period (1947-1991), the Soviet Army and its allied forces relied on the trusted AGS-17 series belt-fed Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) for this sort of in-direct suppression fire. Introduced in 1970, this weapon went on to see combat service from the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) to the more modern engagements of the Nagomo-Karabakh War (2020). After the fall of the Soviet Empire, the series was directly succeeded by the modern AGS-30 in 1995 and this product has also gone on to build its own extensive resume, seeing service in wars around the globe beginning with the 2nd Chechen War. Against this backdrop, the Russian Army has now moved to introduce an even more modern equivalent to these storied solutions - the AGS-40 \"Balkan\".\n\r\nThe AGS-40 has design roots in the Cold War during the 1980s, the work finally culminating in 2017 under TsKIB SOO. The lengthy development cycle is attributed to the tumultuous period following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disarray and economic slump that followed hampered the Russian arms industry. Before long, manufacture of the weapon system began in earnest under the Tecmash Research and Production Association (TRPA) label and this initiative has been ongoing since 2017.\n\r\nThe complete weapon system weighs a hefty 71lb when coupled to its heavy-duty tripod assembly and sans its ammunition load. This value balloons to over 100lb when the ammunition cassette is added.\n\r\nAvailable projectile types consist of 40mm \"caseless\" cartridges - these specially-designed projectiles negating the need for spent shell casings by design - combining the primer, propellant, and projectile into a single unit that is completely used up in the action. The AGS-40 fires three such types: the 7P39 High-Explosive, FRAGmentation (HE-FRAG) round, the 7P39P training round, and the 7P39U training round. The grenades are housed in a hardened circular cassette affixed to the right side of the weapon's frame. The disintegrating belt (arriving in 40-count strips) is looped over the frame and inserted into the firing chamber from the left.\n\r\nOf note is that the use of 40mm caliber is a decided departure from the long-standing reliance on 30mm grenade types common to Soviet-Russian launchers and puts this weapon more in line with offerings seen in the West.\n\r\nThe internal action involves a gas-operated piston with open-bolt component, allowing for automatic fire (5- and 10-round bursts as well as full-auto) to be achieved. Control of the weapon is through spade-type grip handles at the rear of the frame while an optional cushioned butt-plate / seat is noted, adding additional recoil-defeating value by utilizing the operator's own body weight in the firing action - this component locks into the rear two legs of the tripod (the tripod assembly itself provides some inherent recoil-dampening effects). While iron sights are supported, these are primarily retained for backup purposes as optics (typically PAG-17 2.7x magnification) aid in more precise firing down-range. The AGS-40 is capable of reaching target areas out to 2,500 meters and firing at a theoretical rate of 400 rounds-per-minute.\n\r\nThe AGS-40 began deliveries to the Russian armed forces in January 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "aab57e89-1907-42e7-bc92-c36fd4e9429f", "year_model": "1987", "weapon_name": "VSS Vintorez", "weapon_type": "Silenced Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe VSS \"Vintorez\" is a silenced sniper rifle that makes use of a permanent silencer assembly as well as specially-developed subsonic ammunition. The type shares nearly the same contours as the AS Val silenced assault rifle which was developed at the same time. Key markers between the two systems is the VSS's use of a slightly different subsonic cartridge, a fixed, skeletal wood shoulder stock and a long range scope. The VSS entered service with Soviet/Russian special forces in 1987 and has since seen broadened use by internal security forces as well as a regular army. Involvement in combat has been noted in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars and, most recently, the 2008 war against Georgia. Design of the VSS is attributed to Petr Serdjukov with manufacture being handled by the fabled Tula Arms Plant.\n\r\nThe silenced sniper rifle certainly has its value on any battlefield. Its inherent nature allows for quiet operation of the system against targets at range whereas the aforementioned AS Val assault rifle is useful at closer ranges. The VSS primarily relies on two key factors in its success - the specialized cartridge and the integrated silencer. The cartridge is the 9x39mm SP-5 which essentially breaks down as a rifle-caliber 7.62x39mm case with a widened neck to accept a 9mm bullet. It is a heavy cartridge and categorized as \"subsonic\". The AS Val assault rifle follows this same design initiative in its use of the 9x39mm SP-6 round though the VSS cartridge is an armor-piercing  grade cartridge which sets it apart. As in the AS Val, the VSS utilizes a permanently fixed silencer over the barrel and this serves to lower the muzzle velocity of the exiting rounds. While this also lowers the audible frequency of the weapon, it also restricts its range - the trade off of silenced weapons. However, the actual audible sound produced by the VSS is something akin to a whisper in actual operation - perfect for taking out unsuspecting sentries.\n\r\nBeyond its silenced capabilities, the VSS is more or less a conventional rifle system. It sports a boxy receiver with the charging handle and ejection port set to the right side of the body. The pistol grip is integrated with the hollowed stock which features two large loops, the forward most one being for the firer's hand. The hollowed nature of the stock lightened the weapon's overall weight. It is fixed so there is no prospect of making the VSS more compact during maneuvers but it makes for a more sturdy and stable platform in the long run. The VSS can, however, be broken down into key components for scheduled travels. The parts are contained in a provided hard case. The trigger unit is large and very Kalashnikov in its function and styling. The trigger loop is large enough to fit a gloved hand which is always an important consideration when supplying special forces elements. The magazine fits into the magazine well ahead of the trigger unit with the magazine release noted just aft of the well itself. The VSS fired from 10- or 20-round detachable box magazines. The forward handgrip is similar in design to the AS Val rifle, completed with a small area forend before the silencer assembly. The silencer assembly itself is basically tubular in its appearance with a rear sight affixed to the base portion (the section meeting the forend area) and a front sight fitted over the muzzle. The iron sights are adjustable and can be used to back up the standard-issue PSO-1-1 telescopic sight which is fitted over the receiver rear and connected to the gun from supports mounted along the left side of the body. Additionally, the VSS can be fitted with accessories or other scopes such as night vision.\n\r\nOverall, the VSS weighs in at just under 6lbs and sports a running length of 35 inches with an 8 inch barrel being used. The firing action is of gas-operation with a rotating bolt. The gas cylinder is mounted over the barrel as seen in nearly all Kalashnikov weapons. Rate-of-fire is listed at 800 to 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 951 feet per second. Like the AS Val before it, the VSS features just two firing modes - semi-automatic and single-shot. Effective range is out to 400 meters with a maximum range slightly further (at the expense of accuracy).\n\r\nThe \"VSS Vintorez\" name comes from the Russian \"Vintovka Snayperskaya Spetsialnaya\", translating to \"Special Sniper Rifle\" - which is exactly what the VSS represents.\r\n\t\t"}], "vehicles": [{"id": "63683225-437b-46cc-bda9-dfc3c39a2ef7", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tBeginning in the late 1960s, the Soviet engineers began design and development of a new 152mm towed field gun. Following the requisite trials in the early1970s, the weapon was formally adopted for service as the 2A36 \"Giatsint-B\" in 1975. Today, it remains an active inventory portion of several  operators including Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland (as the \"152 K 89\"), Georgia, Moldova, Iraq, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. Production of the 2A36 spanned from 1975 into 1989 by the Perm Automobile Factory SKV and the same gun also makes up the main armament of the 2S5 \"Giatsint-S\" self-propelled gun (SPG) platform.\n\r\nThe 2A36 is largely of a conventional design as towed artillery pieces go. It features a four-wheeled, rubber-tired carriage useful for transporting the massive gun by mover vehicle. The carriage also features a split-trail arrangement that doubles as the recoil \"legs\" when the gun sits in its emplacement (for firing). The rifled barrel is of single piece construction featuring a multi-slotted muzzle brake at its business end and an integrated recoil mechanism down at the mounting. The weapon utilizes a semi-automatic breech block action when loading/reloading with hydraulic power used in elevation, this spanning from -2 to +57 degrees to serve in both the direct- and indirect-fire role as needed. Traverse is limited to -25 to +25 degrees to either side. As a system, the 2A36 weighs a hefty 21,500lb and showcases a length of 40 feet when set up to fire. The carriage provides a wide of 7 feet, 8 inches.\n\r\nFiring a 152.4mm cartridge (charges are loaded separate), the 2A36 can make use of a variety of projectile types including conventional HE (High-Explosive), Anti-Tank (AT), nuclear, submunitions and a rocket-assisted shell which dramatically improves realistic effective ranges. Shells exit the muzzle at up to 3,100 feet per second with listed ranges for conventional ammunition out to 19 miles. Rocket-assisted projectiles gain a range out to 25 miles. The artillery piece relies on an operating crew of eight made up of a group leader, ammunition handlers and gun layers.\n\r\nDespite their Cold War-era origins, 2A36 operators have moved ahead with modernization programs to help keep their guns viable on today's battlefield.

Design work spanned 1976 to 1986 by the Central Design Bureau (Titan) and production has been ongoing out of the Motovilikha Plant since.\n\r\nAs designed, the weapon features a combat weight of 15,000 lb and is operated by a crew of up to ten personnel. It traditionally fires a High-Explosive (HE) shell out to 18 miles through a 2,720 feet-per-second muzzle velocity though there is support for various other projectile types - anti-infantry, chemical, nuclear, etc... The standard gun mounting hardware allows for an elevation span of -3.5 degrees to +70 degrees and traversal of 28 degrees from centerline.

The 2A65 is also the primary weapon aboard the 2A19 Self-Propelled Gun (SPG) artillery vehicle (detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nBecause both the Russians and the Ukrainians have invested in the 2A65 system, it has been featured for both sides of the fighting in the Donbass Region (\"War in Donbass\", 2014-Present).\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2A65 MSTA-B", "vehicle_type": "152mm Towed Howitzer"}, {"id": "50a8258e-15d8-47da-a6c9-413a53deff0a", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2S1 Gvozdika (translating to \"Carnation\") was a standard Red Army self-propelled howitzer platform. The type was recognized in the West in 1974 and given the appropriate designation of \"M1974\". Production of the type was undertaken at state factories in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Poland to which several thousand of these capable systems were delivered. Operators beyond the Red Army included various satellite nations, communist allies and Soviet-friendly nations the world over. The initial 2S1 prototype was completed in 1969 and the type entered service with the Red Army sometime in the early 1970s. Once in operational service, the 2S1 was available in large numbers.\n\r\nThe Soviet Army gained much valuable experience in their dealings with the capable German Army in World War 2. In the decades following, a commitment to ever-improving army support was key to the might of the Soviet land army. Such systems in development became large caliber mortars, field guns, main battle tanks and self-propelled artillery. The advent of the missile age also helped to expand the lethal reach of Soviet military hardware and its weapons were shipped off to any pro-Soviet regime. The 2S1 self-propelled howitzer was one such implement that utilized proven mechanical components with a powerful main gun. Its howitzer nature ensured that it would have been used in support of Soviet troop and armor actions should the Cold War in Europe had ever turned \"hot\".\n\r\nThe 2S1 borrows much of its design from the MT-LB multi-role tracked vehicle. The hull is rather long and featureless, making room for the flat, all-welded turret emplacement to which a 122mm, double-baffled main gun is fitted. This provides the 2S1 with a low profile and squat appearance, making her easy to conceal and more difficult to identify. The glacis plate is well sloped towards the turret roof for optimal ballistics protection. The multi-faceted turret is fully powered and holds three of the four crew - the commander, loader and gunner while the driver mains a forward left-hull position. The turret can traverse a full 360 degrees and provides for an elevation range of +70 to -3 degrees. A fume extractor is clearly identified along the gun barrel. The engine is fitted to the front of the hull. The running tack systems are fitted to each hull side and sport seven road wheels and feature and adjustable suspension system. The drive sprocket is at the front with the track idler at the rear. No track return rollers are present. Beyond the main gun fitting, there are no other secondary weapon systems available to the crew. Armor protection is 20mm at its thickest.\n\r\nOne of the key qualities of the 2S1 design is its fully amphibious nature, allowing it to traverse water sources with little preparation on the part of the crew. While no dedicated propulsion jet is fitted, the 2S1 is propelled through water by the motion of its own track systems.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S1 Gvozdika (M1974)", "vehicle_type": "122mm Self-Propelled Artillery (SPA)"}, {"id": "cdad3e87-2910-4eb5-89a4-b3a547f4a517", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV self-propelled artillery system has been developed for the Russian Army as a successor to the late-Cold-War-era 2S19 MSTA series vehicle (detailed elsewhere on this site).

Service entry is expected sometime in 2018 or later.\n\r\nThe 2S35 was born as an offshoot of the existing 2S19 design and prototypes were devised along this line, utilizing the same running gear, powerplant and chassis as the original (though with a slightly altered turret). One form relied on a twin-barreled 152mm arrangement but this approach was not furthered / adopted.

The Soviet vehicle, designated as the \"M1973\" in American nomenclature, began its development during 1968 to which manufacture was directed by Uraltransmash and production spanned from 1967 to 1993. Several major forms ultimately emerged including all-modernized versions to keep the system a viable artillery piece. The 2S3 has since gone on to see considerable battlefield activity and proven itself on more than one occasion through its accuracy and mechanical reliability. As such, many remain as frontline use today (2014), primarily with former Soviet states and global allies.\n\r\nThe heart of the 2S3 is its D-series L/27 main gun based on the D-20 army howitzer. Typically, a single vehicle carried 40 to 46 projectiles in a mixed arrangement to include HE-FRAG (High-Explosive, FRAGmentation), HEAT-FS (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank, Fin-Stabilized), Armor-Piercing, Tungsten (AP-T), smoke and illumination projectiles. The main gun is affixed to a turret allowing for full 360-degree traversal to be achieved. The mounting also gives an elevation range of -4 to +60 degrees. Loading is through a semi-automatic, vertical wedge breech with a rate-of-fire reaching four rounds per minute. Conventional shells range out to 11.5 miles while Rocket-Assisted Projectiles (RAPs) can reach out to 15 miles. Secondary armament (optional) included a remote-controlled 7.62mm PKT machine gun to which 1,500 x 7.62mm rounds were carried.\n\r\nThe 2S3 is typically fielded with a crew of six made up of the driver, vehicle commander, gunner, loader and a pair of ammunition handlers though some versions are seen with a crew of four. Armor protection ranges from 15mm to 30mm, the thickest sections along the front of the hull and turret.\n\r\nThe vehicle's drivetrain includes a V-59 series 12-cylinder, water-cooled, diesel-fueled engine developing 520 horsepower at 2,000rpm. This is mated to a planetary gearbox. The running gear (track-over-wheel arrangement) showcases six double-tired road wheels to a hull side, the drive sprocket at front and the track idler at rear. The hull sits atop an independent torsion bar suspension system with hydraulic shock absorbers found at the first and sixth wheel pairings. Performance specifications include a maximum road speed of 40 miles per hour.\n\r\nOriginal 2S3 vehicles were designated simply as \"2S3\" and these saw production from 1970 to 1975. The 2S3M mark followed as a modernized version and introduced a slightly revised hatch arrangement as well as increased internal stowage for more 152mm projectiles among other features. The main gun was updated to support laser-guided, RAPs and production spanned from 1975 to 1987. The 2S3M1, which was produced from 1987 to 1993, marked a new 2S3 standard when introduced, given a new sighting device and additional equipment to improve battlefield support and awareness. Earlier 2S3 and 2S3M marks were eventually updated to this standard. The 2S3M2 of 2000 became another further modernized mark and introduced use of an automatic Fire Control System (FCS) as well as externally-mounted smoke grenade dischargers and a satellite-based navigation system. This mark has been exported under the 2S3M2-155 designation. The 2SM3 is a known developmental 2S3 mark incorporating a new FCS and new howitzer gun, more in line with that as found on the modern 2S19 Msta SPA. As such, it can share the same ammunition clearances.\n\r\nOperators of the 2S3 have proven plentiful with many still showcasing the system as frontline weapon. Beyond the obvious Russian Army connection (which absorbed thousands of the ex-Soviet Army stock), the vehicle has been taken on by the armies of Azerbaijan, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Belarus, Cuba, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Libya, Russia, Slovakia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Former operators include Bulgaria, East Germany and Iraq. The United States Army gained access to four examples from Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall and an additional three were gained in dealings with the Ukrainian government following the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\r\nThe Russian Army maintains about 930 active 2S3 systems in its inventory with a further 1,600 believed to be held in storage. It is also used by the Russian Marines.\n\r\nThe 2S3 has become a truly battle-tested weapon system, first used in anger during the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan (1979-1989). It was then pressed into action during the Tajikistan Civil War (1992-1997) and used during both of the Chechen Wars (1994-1996, 1999). In the 2008 South Ossetia War, the 2S3 was again in play with good results.

There are seven road wheels to a track side with a front-mounted drive sprocket and rear idler. There are no track return rollers present. The engine is fitted to the front-right of the hull with the driver at the front-left. This allows the center-rear of the vehicle to seat the traversing powered turret housing the main crew, ammunition stores and main armament. Access hatches along the turret roof line allow entry/exit for the turret crew. The driver is granted a vision block and access hatch at his position as well as a hinged armor panel. The engine is exhausted through a port along the front-right side of the hull. The glacis plate is well-sloped which provides a shallower target. The vehicle showcases a maximum road speed of 60 kilometers with an operational of 500 kilometers thanks to its diesel engine installation.\n\r\nKey changes to the original 2S1 system include the installation of a new, more potent 120mm 2A80 main gun, replacing the standard 122mm 2A31 series. A new Fire Control System (FCS) is mated to the gun that promises improved accuracy, rate-of-fire and support for more ammunition types at the disposal of the Russian Army (including guided munition types). Two banks of three smoke grenade dischargers have been added to the turret sides allowing the vehicle to screen its own movements in-the-field. A trainable mounting at the commander's hatch supports a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun.\n\r\nTo date (February 2014), the current Russian Army inventory counts approximately 30 2S34 vehicles. \r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S34 Chosta", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH)"}, {"id": "fc7b8e8d-e732-4aa6-a1c1-72627eed7fd9", "year_model": "2018", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV self-propelled artillery system has been developed for the Russian Army as a successor to the late-Cold-War-era 2S19 MSTA series vehicle (detailed elsewhere on this site). The 2S35 was debuted during the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade and the product has been inching ever closer to full operational service in the inventory of Russian ground forces. Service entry is expected sometime in 2018 or later.\n\r\nThe 2S35 was born as an offshoot of the existing 2S19 design and prototypes were devised along this line, utilizing the same running gear, powerplant and chassis as the original (though with a slightly altered turret). One form relied on a twin-barreled 152mm arrangement but this approach was not furthered / adopted. The revised design, essentially an all-new offering, was brought online around late-2014 and state trials were had leading to an order for serial production of the vehicles.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S35 Koalitsiya-SV", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Artillery (SPA) Vehicle"}, {"id": "385d7848-6dc8-44eb-a64a-fa5fd2bd815e", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2S4 \"Tyulpan\" was developed as a fully-tracked, self-propelled heavy mortar platform. The 30-ton system was first witnessed by the West in 1975 which gave birth to the NATO designation of \"M1975\" (not to be confused with the 2S7 \"Pion\", also given the NATO designation of M1975). It still maintains an active presence in the Russian Army inventory and has seen noted combat actions in Afghanistan (1979-1989) and Chechnya (1999-2009). The Soviet designation was consistent with the accepted practice of an alpha-numeric system (\"2S4\") and the association to a flower (\"Tyulpan\").\n\r\nThe Red Army witnessed the value of large-caliber mortar systems first-hand in World War 2. The Soviets therefore fielded a large collection of field mortars ranging from infantry level types to massive 240mm caliber monsters in their fight against the Germans. By the end of the war, the large-caliber mortar had managed a permanent foothold in the Red Army inventory and little was to change with the upcoming Cold War against the West. Development of a self-propelled and modern mortar carrier began in 1960.\n\r\nOverall, the 2S4 is a rather utilitarian weapon system consistent with Soviet armor doctrine - \"quick production and a big gun\". The vehicle is assigned an operating crew of up to nine personnel making up both vehicle and mortar gunnery elements. The vehicle portion of the 2S4 is nothing more than a modified chassis of the GMZ-class minelayer complete with a torsion bar suspension system for adequate off road travel capabilities in keeping up with the main armored force. The hull contains the engine, transmission and driver position with the driver is seated front left. Power is supplied by a single V-59 series diesel engine developing 520 horsepower output. As a tracked vehicle, the 2S4 makes use of six double-tired road wheels to a track side along with a drive sprocket at the front of the hull and a track idler at the rear. There are four track return rollers present with no side armor skirts being used to protect these vulnerable areas. The hull superstructure is multi-faceted and rather low-set against the lower hull portion of the vehicle. The crew is relatively protected (20mm thick armor) but the 2S4 is not intended for direct combat against seen foes. It instead makes use of ranged fire support for the benefit of other allied ground components in action. The mortar portion of the vehicle consists of a massive 240mm M240 series heavy field mortar made up of a launch tube and baseplate. The mortar is externally attached to the rear portion of the hull and lowered into position to be set along the ground at the vehicle rear, made ready to fire by the associated gunnery crew. Mortar projectiles are loaded via the breech as opposed to the muzzle as in infantry-level mortars. Up to 40 x 240mm projectiles were afforded the crew. There is a cupola aft of the driver's position along he hull roof that houses an access hatch and gun mount to which a 7.62mm PKT series machine gun can be affixed for anti-infantry defense.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S4 / SM-240 Tyulpan (M1975)", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Mortar"}, {"id": "fe08bfe8-d6fd-46b5-ae86-31b97a121c96", "year_model": "1978", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2S9 \"Nona\" (\"Newest Ordnance Ground Artillery\") was introduced with Soviet Army forces in 1981 as a self-propelled, tracked, light armored artillery mortar vehicle.

The vehicle maintains an active status in the modern Russian Army and has found homes in the inventories of several global armies worldwide. Production has reached at least 1,000 units.\n\r\nAt the heart of the 2S9 is its 120mm 2A60 heavy field mortar which is fitted to a powered, traversing turret set atop the hull of the BTR-D. The BTR-D was introduced in 1974 as a lightweight airborne multirole tracked platform. With its compact dimensions and light-class weight, the vehicle proved an air-transportable system and could serve typically lightly-armed units behind enemy lines. The 2S9 is a 9.6-ton vehicle powered y a 5D20 series, V8, water-cooled, diesel-fueled engine of 240 horsepower mounted in the rear. Road speeds reach 37 miles per hour with an operational range out to 310 miles. Cross-country travel is aided by the torsion bar suspension system. Armor protection for the crew of four is up to 15mm at its thickest. Some 40 to 60 120mm mortar rounds are carried for the primary weapon while local defense is through a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun.

A large focus was eventually placed upon mobile artillery support that involved rocket fire (\"Katyusha\" systems) with towed artillery elements and, beyond that, Self-Propelled Gun (SPG) units. This wartime experience considerably influenced designs that would appear after the war which saw \"big-gunned\" vehicles become the norm in supporting major offensives. The 2S7 \"Pion\" (Peony\") was taken into inventory in 1976 and its design was centered around a massive 203mm gun barrel which sat atop a tracked chassis. Despite its Cold War roots, this effective fire support vehicle remains in service to this day (2015).\n\r\nWhen recognized by the West, NATO assigned the designation of \"M1975\" (\"Model 1975\") to the 2S7. It carried the official Soviet Army designation of \"SO-203\" as well. When adopted by the service, the 2S7 became the largest Self-Propelled Artillery (SPA) vehicle in service anywhere in the world.\n\r\nWith the arrival of the T-80 Main Battle Tank (MBT), the Soviet Army had an all-modern track-and-wheel chassis from which to spawn a line of associated vehicles from. The 2S7 was developed to support offensive actions involving tanks as well as infantry and other mobile assets for frontline service involving indirect fire. The 2S7 became a 46.5-ton vehicle mating the 203mm 2A44 series howitzer atop the T-80 tank chassis which utilized a V-46-I V-12 turbocharged diesel-fueled engine of 840 horsepower and was fitted at the middle of the hull.

One such development of the period became the 8x8 wheeled 9K52 \"Luna-M\" battalion-level mobile battlefield rocket launcher carrying a single large rocket over the modified chassis of a ZiL-135LM military truck. The rocket was capable of unleashing conventional, chemical, and nuclear payloads at range, reaching speeds of Mach 3 in flight, and could \"touch\" targets as far out as 40 miles. The vehicle was initially developed (under the designation of \"3R-11\" and \"9R11\") as a nuclear-capable solution to deter any advanced from the West, mainly in and around East Germany, but were later converted to a conventionally-minded variant to better serve a Soviet frontline assault.\n\r\nThe vehicle was known to NATO as \"Frog-7\" and remains in limited use worldwide. In practice, it proved inaccurate, sensitive to weather/environment, and required a resupply vehicle on hand to replenish the single-shot rocket component. As such, it was eventually succeeded in the Soviet inventory by the more effective OTR-21 \"Tochka\" (NATO: SS-21 \"Scarab\") of 1976 detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nFirst-use of this battlefield system was by Syria in 1973 during the Yom Kipper War against Israel.

Each wheel, therefore, drove the wheels along its respective side of the chassis allowing for full 8x8 support. The wheels were arranged in a rather unique way with the front and rear axles set well apart from the inner second and third axles. Consequently, only the front and rear axles became steerable in the design.

Able to fire rockets containing a variety of warheads (including chemical types), the Smerch saw widespread adoption with Soviet-supported and aligned nations and states from Armenia to Venezuela. Even after the dissolution of the Soviet Empire, the vehicles were passed on to successor states while local models has been maintained by the new Russian Army. While its footprint today remains evermore limited compared to its peak worldwide usage period, the vehicle still holds much battlefield value to its operators.\n\r\nRussia manages a current (2015) stock of over 100 systems though the series has since been superseded on paper by the adoption of the more modern 9A52-4 \"Tornado\" line (detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nThe Smerch series is a whole weapon system containing several key critical components for effective functioning.

Road speeds reach 37 miles per hour with operational ranges out to 530 miles.\n\r\nThe launcher component of the launch vehicle sits over the rear section of the truck and features traverse and elevation controlling which means the vehicle can be parked facing any direction. The launch tubes are arranged in three groups of four tubes each with two groups set across from one another in a 2x2 arrangement. The remaining tubes are arranged in a single row across the top of the other eight - this helps to clear the lift controls and support structure found at the base of the launcher pack. Prior to firing, the vehicle must come to a complete stop and have its recoil legs lowered. The operating cabin for the launcher is featured aft of the driver's compartment and over/between the first and second axles. The Smerch can be made ready-to-fire in three minutes and displace (move to another location) in a little as two. Its twelve rocket payload can clear the launcher unit in 38 seconds while reloading takes approximately 20 minutes.\n\r\nThe TZM 9T234-2 serves as the reload vehicle / ammunition carrier and carries with it twelve 300mm rockets. 1K123 \"Vivary\" designates the accompanying Command Post (CP) component and the PM-2-70 MTO-V serves as the system's direct maintenance / support vehicle. 9A52 formally designates the BM-30 series and now includes the 9A52-4, a lighter-weight model featured on a KamAZ-6350 series truck with variable launcher packs supported (as such it is made more modular). 9A52-2T designates the export Smerch featuring a Tatra T816 series truck chassis.\n\r\nOver the life of the BM-30's operational service, several rocket projectiles were developed beyond the standard 9M528 High-Explosive, Fragmentation (HI-FRAG) variant. This has come to include cluster-based munition/mine dispensers (anti-personnel, anti-tank types), HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) rockets, and thermobaric (high temperature fuel-air bomb) rockets.\n\r\nDespite its Cold War origins, the Smerch series was not used in combat until the 2014 during the Syrian Civil War by government forces against rebel groups. That same year, it was featured by Ukrainian government forces in their offensives against Russian-backed rebels in the Ukrainian east. While an unknown number of Syrian Army BM-30s remain in service, the Ukrainian Army was known to possess some near-100 systems at one point. Pakistan locally produces the BM-30 as the A-100E through its Supako Factory of Karachi. Some 36 vehicles have since entered service with the Pakistani Army. Neighboring India is another operator with 42 9A52-2T models in service.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BM-30 (Smerch) / 9A52-2", "vehicle_type": "8x8 Wheeled Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)"}, {"id": "d9fec799-7c77-44d4-b97a-47ebb8c0c480", "year_model": "1966", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet military was first major military power to widely adopt the concept of an \"armored fighting infantry carrier\" through their revolutionary BMP-1 series of 1967. The type incorporated a conventional track-and-wheel design with low-profile hull and turret fitting substantial armament designed to transport combat-ready infantry in relative (armored) safety while being able to bring its own anti-infantry/tank-killing firepower to bear. The vehicle was fast enough to compete with the main mechanized force as it advanced deeper into enemy-held territory and its amphibious capabilities allowed it to traverse off-road, poorly defended areas with due diligence, thusly overwhelming even a prepared enemy such as those expected to be encountered during the Cold War across the European battlescape. \n\r\nThe BMP-1 was primarily developed to replace the limited BTR-50 series vehicles (in particular the BTR-50P model) to which the much improved 8x8 wheeled BTR-60 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) was also developed in conjunction and produced on an equally large scale alongside the more technologically-laden BMP-1 family. Both vehicles went on to see considerable usage overseas and across countless conflicts dotting the Cold War decades. Despite having entered Soviet Army service in 1966, the BMP-1 was first identified by the West in November of 1967 and is now generally recognized as the first \"true\" Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV), classified as such due to its ability to transport troops, disembarking them and then being able to operate as a stand-alone armored fighting vehicle (AFV). Thusly the BMP-1 was something of a revolutionary hybrid design incorporating the best assets of a light-class tank with the benefits of an armored personnel carrier - essentially creating a new sub-class of armored vehicle. Contemporary Western counterparts have since gone on to include the American Bradley, British Warrior and German Marder.\n\r\nThe BMP-1 designation is born of the words \"Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty 1\" which translates to \"Infantry Fighting Vehicle 1\". Due to the limited nature of intelligence fielded by the West during the Cold War, the BMP-1 was initially recognized as the \"M1967\"before evolving into the \"BMP-1\" designation.\n\r\nDesign work on the BMP-1 series began in 1959-1960 through competition involving various concerns. The resulting winner became the \"Obyekt 764\" prototype which seemingly incorporated all of the design features sought by the Soviet Army (firepower, performance and protection). The first pilot vehicle was completed in 1964 and testing of more evolved models occurred into 1965 before the type was adopted in 1966 after having passed the requisite state trials.\n\r\nThe BMP-1 proved a departure from previous armored infantry carriers in that most early versions of such vehicle featured an open-air passenger cabin which exposed its infantry to all manner of battlefield dangers and environmental effects and hazards (namely the threat of nuclear war realistically persistent throughout the 1950s). The Soviet design incorporated a low-profile hull with extremely sloped glacis plate and basic operating crew of three (driver, gunner and commander). The engine was fitted to a front-right compartment to open the rear of the design for the passenger compartment and entry/exit through the unobstructed rear. The turret was set at center with unfettered views around the hull. The rear of the hull serviced eight infantry seated across two benches (four infantry per bench) facing outwards (fuel was stored between the two seat rows). The hull sides were given protected firing ports (four to a side) which allowed passengers the ability to help defend the vehicle through small arms fire from their own personal weapons (periscopes allowed for direct aiming though the ports themselves were not stabilized). Entry/access for the troops was through a pair of outward-opening hinged doors found at the rear face of the hull, each also sporting their own firing ports and aiming periscopes. The driver sat at the front-left in the hull with a personal hatch over his position and vision blocks for when the vehicle was \"buttoned down\". The turret maintained a hatch for the gunner while the commander resided in a special position just aft of the driver in the hull. As designed, and in keeping with common Soviet armored doctrine of the time, the BMP-1 was fully-amphibious and able to traverse open bodies of water with relative ease while being propelled about by the motion of its own tracks. Preparation consisted of raising a front-mounted trim vane and bilge pumps were turned on prior to any deep water entry. Water speeds totaled just 4.3 mph.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMP-1 (Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty)", "vehicle_type": "Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) / Light Tank"}, {"id": "eb578290-c76b-4baf-bd77-2af49595bcfb", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet Union introduced the concept of the Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) with the adoption of its BMP-1 in 1966. The type immediately proved revolutionary and was exported to over 40 Soviet-allied nations and states while, with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, absorbed by various emerging home nations where collections resided. The type's reach proved so popular that thousands were produced with many still in active circulation today (2013). However, the design showcased several key tactical limitations, particularly during the Arab-Israeli wars and the Soviet-Afghanistan War that an improved type was ordered. This eventually became the \"BMP-2\" family of tracked armored vehicles.\n\r\nThe \"BMP\" name is derived from the Russian \"Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty\" which, when translated, becomes \"Infantry Combat Vehicle\".\n\r\nThe IFV concept emerged with the Soviet plan to introduce a vehicle that offered performance suitable for fast-moving mechanized forces, protection and troop-carrying capabilities of an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) with the firepower of a light tank. This endeavor inevitably produced the BMP-1.\n\r\nWhile successful at its core, the BMP-1 offered some notable inherent limitations on the ever-evolving battlefield. It was, for all intents and purposes, designed for fighting across the European battlescape. First combat actions were in Arab hands against Israeli forces during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and results were not promising when many fell to large-caliber machine gun fire and small caliber artillery systems. When pressed into service across the dry, hot and rugged terrain of Afghanistan against non-conventional forces wielding RPGs (Rocket Propelled Grenades), the design proved vulnerable in several key areas. \n\r\nThe base armament of 73mm cannon with onboard support for a 1st Generation anti-tank missile was surpassed by counters emerging in the West. The 73mm cannon itself proved particularly inaccurate at the required engagement ranges. The AT-3 \"Sagger\", designed as a wire-guided anti-tank missile, required the operator to be exposed out of the turret roof when guiding the missile to its target. Other limitations including the internal arrangement which sat the commander directly behind the driver in the hull. Not only did this limit his tactical vantage point of the situation ahead, a single direct hit from an enemy projectile could kill both crew - rendering the vehicle a complete loss. The internal passenger seating arrangement was also of note as the twin back-to-back benches were set about the fuel stores fitted in-between, this proving an obvious hazard to passengers and crew alike. Similarly, the ammunition stowed about the hull was exposed and could explode if taken a direct hit.\n\r\nWhile a modernization program produced the improved BMP-1P, the endeavor was an interim design pending the arrival of a new type. This begat work on such a product in 1972, a direct successor as the aptly-designated \"BMP-2\". \n\r\nThe new BMP-2 held a form and function that remained largely faithful to the original save for a few key qualities which instantly set it apart for the better. The hull was shortened and widened for a new internal arrangement and minimized side profile along the horizon. The driver remained at the front-left of the hull with the powerpack to his immediate right. The commander, however, was moved from his hull placement to the new two-man turret, joining the gunner. This arrangement now provided a better communications arrangement between gunner and commander. The passenger cabin was reworked and reduced to include space for only six infantry (down from the original's eight seating) while the twin doors (opening outward) at the rear hull face allowed for infantry entry/exit as normal. An additional infantryman was stationed behind the driver in the commander's old position. Passengers, once again, sat across two benches fitted back to back with access to firing ports that contained periscopes for aiming. Four firing ports were allotted to the left hull side with three along the right which allowed passengers to defend the vehicle with personal weapons as necessary. Night vision equipment remained standard for all three crew positions and NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection was required on the nuclear-driven Cold War battlefield. The BMP-2 retained the former's all-amphibious approach though improved such qualities through a sharper prow at front and lengthened deflector at rear with propulsion based on the motion of the moving tracks so no dedicated waterjet was required. However, prior to water entry, the vehicle required the crew to erect a trim vane and turn on bilge pumps as in the BMP-1. Unlike early production BMP-1 vehicles, which relied on an internal exhaust-based smoke generation system, the BMP-2 was fielded complete with 6 x electrically-operated smoke grenade dischargers (three per turret front side) while retaining the engine-based system as well. Armor protection was 33mm at the thickest, mostly along the critical frontal facings though the armor protection scheme as a whole was reportedly improved based on actions in the Middle East and Afghanistan.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMP-2 (Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty)", "vehicle_type": "Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV)"}, {"id": "7bfffd10-0e10-45b3-8415-d44a81e88d13", "year_model": "1987", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet military was first major military power to widely adopt the concept of an \"armored fighting infantry carrier\" through their revolutionary BMP-1 series of 1967.

The vehicle would be paired with Russian tanks and other frontline fighting vehicles and provide additional offensive capabilities in-the-field all the while retaining the protection and mobility of a tank and Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV). In 2011, the BMPT (recognized as the \"Terminator\") was revealed, the heavily armed and armored tracked system being based on the existing chassis of the classic Soviet-era T-72 Main Battle Tank (MBT). The vehicle is manufactured by Uralvagonzavod.\n\r\nThe BMPT is neither tank nor IFV as it lacks a heavy-caliber turreted main gun to serve as the former and does away with troop-ferrying facilities to serve as the latter. Instead it is a true support vehicle featuring a standard crew of five, weighing in at 53 tons (short), and showcasing a bevy of armament options suitable for engaging both heavy- and light-weight enemy vehicles at range as well as defending allied tanks against enemy infantry attacks. Primary armament are 2 x 30mm 2A42 series autocannons coupled with 4 x 130mm \"Ataka-T\" Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) launchers fitted to the turret - these provide considerable firepower against armored targets at range. Secondary armament comes in the form of 2 x 30mm AG-17D \"Plamya\" 30mm automatic grenade launchers for suppression of enemy infantry and the vehicle also carries 1 x 7.62mm PKTM for extremely local defense. Armor protection is a combination arrangement involving composite, steel, and reactive armor. Dimensions include an overall length of 23.6 feet, a width of 11 feet, and a height of 11.2 feet allowing the vehicle to be transported by railway, heavy duty truck, or certain transport aircraft.\n\r\nAs the vehicle utilizes the existing T-72 running gear, it has six double-tired roadwheels to a hull side with the drive sprocket found at rear and the track idler located at front. The upper track section is well protected through side skirt armor plates. Drive power is from a single Model V-92S2 diesel-fueled engine supplying 1,000 horsepower. Coupled with the torsion bar suspension, this provides the vehicle with a maximum road speed of 37 miles per hour and an operational road range out to 340 miles. Off-road travel is also possible though with reduced performance characteristics. Ground clearance is a useful sixteen inches.\n\r\nThe need for such a heavy-class vehicle originally arose through the Soviet commitment in the Soviet-Afghanistan War where BMP vehicles proved highly susceptible to close-range, guerilla-style ambush attacks. These vehicles also lacked the flexibility and versatility needed in combating a more fluid, though rather primitive, enemy force. Design work on a solution began in the 1980s and several prototype vehicles were reviewed. The need was further pressed home with combat experience in the First Chechen War where fighting in city streets proved the norm. Again, existing BMP type vehicles failed to provide the necessary engagement capabilities and crew protection being sought by commanders in-the-field.\n\r\nThis led to further work on additional prototypes which ultimately begat the Object 199 model. Unveiled in 2000, the vehicle entered serial production in 2002. Very well-armed and armored, the BMPT was, rather interestingly, passed on by the modern Russian Army - authorities citing the Cold War-era T-72 origins as the primary reason. Instead, the vehicle has found its first export operator in Kazakhstan with interest being generated by the governments of Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Peru. The Russian Army will instead move on securing a new generation of armored fighting vehicles most likely tied to the new T-99 \"Armata\" family line which includes the T-14 MBT and the T-15 IFV (both detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nUralvagonzavod has offered a \"Terminator 2\" package to retrofit existing T-72 MBTs for the Heavy Armored Support Vehicle (HASV) role. Despite its Cold War roots, the T-72 maintains healthy active numbers with many operators across the globe - from Algeria and Angola to Vietnam and Yemen.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMPT (Terminator) (Object 199)", "vehicle_type": "Heavy Armored Support Vehicle (HASV)"}, {"id": "fe9e5ac6-7059-4b45-b3e3-cf9fd6e7fe5c", "year_model": "1966", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BRDM-2 primarily served as an armored scout car with the Soviet Army during the height of the Cold War. She was a direct replacement to the limited BRDM-1 scout car series and, like many of the Soviet Cold War offerings, the newer BRDM-2 proved a cheap yet still capable system, making it a popular export product the world over. Thousands of examples were ultimately produced and the type was fielded in anger throughout several of the key global conflicts between the years 1960 and 2000. While she still serves with many nations across the globe (mostly Soviet-allied customers), the BRDM-2 now remains a limited product all her own when set on the modern battlefield. Regardless, she has proven herself a combat-capable system and has enjoyed the successes of her rather simplistic yet utterly reliable design.\n\nThe PT-76 Light Tank\n\r\nIn 1949, designs were on the boards for a new amphibious light tank to be used in the reconnaissance role for the Soviet Army. This design evolved into the PT-76 which entered service in August of 1952. The PT-76 lent itself well to the blossoming mobile army doctrine of the Soviets and allowed for unprecedented access to both land and water at speed. What the new system would need now is a comparable reconnaissance vehicle that could keep up with the inherent mobility of the new light tank - something which the current Soviet inventory found elusive in the available offerings. As such, the BRDM-1 scout car was born.\n\nThe BRDM-1\n\r\nThe BRDM-1 (originally as the \"BRDM\" before there was a \"BRDM-2\") was an initial scout car design that first appeared in the Soviet Army inventory in 1957 (design beginning in 1954). Of note was her 4x4 off-road capability and her amphibious quality, the former aided by a pair of powered belly wheels and the latter coming in the form of a rear-mounted water jet for propulsion. The engine was mounted in the front hull with the crew compartment set to the middle-rear. The BRDM-1 led a healthy existence, seeing over 10,000 examples produced and delivered to a large portion of Soviet allied nations in varied battlefield forms - she was adapted to carry a range of anti-tank missiles as well, improving her tactical usefulness to an extent. However, the BRDM-1 design was inherently limited at its core. She maintained no trainable turreted armament system (the gunner need expose himself to enemy fire to operate the external machine gun) nor was her crew protected from the effects of a nuclear war - prevalent in the Cold War years. Additionally, she was not given night vision equipment, making her a liability in such an environment. To add insult to injury, the BRDM-1 also lacked any sort of specialized reconnaissance-minded vision equipment - considering her role as a reconnaissance scout car, this was a wholly major drawback.\n\nThe BRDM-2\n\r\nAs such, it wasn't long before the BRDM-2 series of scout cars was born to \"right the wrongs\" of the previous design. The BRDM-2 first appeared in 1962 (a design credited to V.K. Rubtsov) and came online as a direct replacement for the BRDM-1. The BRDM-2 brought along with it several key improvements that made for a better system - including revisions and improvements to the amphibious capabilities, on-road/off-road performance and armament. Additionally, the BRDM-2 was fitted with NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection as well as night vision equipment.  The engine was moved to the rear of the hull with the crew compartment positioned to the middle-front. A powered turret was added to hold the armament and the powered belly wheels were retained. Production was handled by the Molotov GAZ Plant in Gorkiy, Russia. In all, some 7,200 examples went on to see production (from 1962 to 1989) and, at her usage height, some 40 nations fielded the BRDM-2. She proved a regular at Soviet pride parades during the Cold War and was publicly seen for the first time to Western observers in 1966.\n\nBRDM-2 Walk-Around\n\r\nIt is easy to dismiss the BRDM-2 based on looks alone for she maintains a rather utilitarian appearance with little to recommend herself. However, she is a capable wheeled system that has seen use the world over. The design is characterized by her four large road wheels offering full 4x4 support, these set on leaf springs with hydraulic shock absorbers. The wheels are spaced well apart, particularly when viewed in the side profile. Wheel wells are high-arcing and promote flexibility in steering while collecting and deflecting the mud and dust of the terrain. The lower hull is slab-sided along the sides and rear panels but sloped upwards along the front. The lower front hull angles up to the nearly-flat glacis plate. The glacis plate contours into the hull superstructure and allows a forward panel for vision ports afforded to the front-seated personnel. The sides of the superstructure are angled inwards towards the top. The design is capped by a rounded, low-profile, flat-topped, fully-enclosed turret structure that itself maintains relatively unfettered 360-degree rotation (these is only a communications antenna to the forward right-hand side of the design, near the commander's hatch). Headlamps are held at the forward extreme corners of the upper hull glacis plate and partially protected by armored rails. The driver makes use of external mirrors to view his immediate and distant surroundings. The forward armor vision panels can be raised and lowered at operator discretion. When raised, the glass-covered vision port (bulletproof) allows for improved forward visibility. Vision blocks for the crew are set at the upper access hatches as well as the sides of the hull superstructure while the commander and driver also have use of periscopes when the vehicle is fully \"buttoned down\". The engine is fitted to the rear of the hull unlike the BRDM-1. There is an integrated winch system built into the front hull of the BRDM-2 design as well as a central tire pressure system. The tire pressure system allows the driver to adapt one or all of his road wheels \"on-the-fly\" to the terrain ahead.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BRDM-2", "vehicle_type": "4x4 Wheeled Amphibious Light Armored Scout Car"}, {"id": "36006c1d-f8c0-45a2-927f-34a2006ffc8e", "year_model": "1977", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9P148 \"Konkurs\", also incorrectly identified by some as the \"BRDM-3\", is a variant of the base BRDM-2 Amphibious Scout Car series appearing in 1962, developed to replace the BRDM-1. The BRDM-2 series proved itself quite an adaptable and capable battlefield system since its inception and went on to see service beyond the Soviet Union with some 40 countries worldwide - many continuing its operation even today. The Konkurs derivative is mechanically similar to the base BRDM-2 vehicle and only differentiated by its mounting of the Konkurs (NATO: \"Spandrel\") anti-tank missile launcher atop the hull. The end-product is, therefore, a highly mobile, cross-country, anti-tank support vehicle that can reconnoiter terrain, report enemy positions and defend itself against enemy armor.\n\r\nOutwardly, the 9P148 highly mimics the original BRDM-2 Scout Car as it retains the rather utilitarian appearance of the original including its four wheel 4x4-power layout, slab lower hull and angled upper hull facings. It also retains the four auxiliary wheels that can be lowered at the center of the vehicle sides. Various vision ports allow the crew of two or three personnel sighting opportunities from the relative safety of the vehicle. Multiple access hatches allow for entry/exit of the vehicle. The boat-like front hull is purposefully designed as the 9P148 - like the base BRDM-2 before it - is fully amphibious, propelled through water by a propeller system buried at the rear facing of the lower hull.\n\r\nConcerning the support for the Konkurs missile, the 9P148 sports a five-launcher rail for the 9M113 Konkurs series wire-guided, anti-tank missile system (NATO: AT-5 \"Spandrel\"). The 135mm missile was introduced in 1974 to provide Soviet anti-tank teams a counter to NATO armor in-the-field. The missile packed a tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) warhead coupled with a solid-fueled rocket booster while detonation was by way of direct force contact. With an effective range of 2.5 miles, the Spandrel could reach out to enemy tanks at distance with good penetration results. As a wire-guided weapon, however, the operator could only control the missile (via thrust vectoring) during flight so long as the data wire attached to missile and launcher had not been severed. Sighting was accomplished by way of a device installation mounted along the front right of the upper hull. The launching system was specifically designed to be retractable and rest along the turret roof during transport while also decreasing the vehicle's side profile. The crew could launch all five missiles from within the protective hull or remotely by way of a relay cable, the crew positioned up to 80 meters away from the vehicle. Reloading was, however, managed externally from the onboard supply of missiles and as many as 14 could be carried. The crew reloaded the launcher rails through a hatch located aft of the launcher itself.\n\r\nIt is worth noting that early production 9P148 forms were restricted to firing only the 9M113 Konkurs series missile but the system has since evolved to support the 9M111 \"Fagot\" (NATO: AT-4 \"Spigot\") as well. Modernization to the 9P148 series has brought about the installation of a \"whip\" aerial communications antenna  as well as newer sighting devices relying the latest available technologies for much improved day and night support.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BRDM-2 / 9P148 (Spandrel / Konkurs)", "vehicle_type": "Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) Carrier / Armored Scout Car"}, {"id": "5718b552-0caf-4817-823c-bed99bf4bcee", "year_model": "1960", "description": "\r\n        \tOne of the most important vehicles of the Soviet Union during the Cold War (1947-1991) became the BTR series of 8x8 wheeled, amphibious Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs). The line began with the BTR-40 armored truck of the 1950s and advanced into the tracked BTR-50 of 1954 (both detailed elsewhere on this site). In 1959 there debuted the definitive 8x8 wheeled form as the BTR-60 and this was followed by the improved BTR-70 (1972) and BTR-80 (1986) models. In the 1990s, the line was evolved once more, becoming the all-modern BTR-90, still in service with Russian Army (Internal Troops) forces today (2017).\n\r\nThe BTR-90 saw development begin in the early 1990s (about 1994) by the Arzamas Machine Building Plant, otherwise known as \"AMZ\" (part of GAZ). A pilot form became available for testing and evaluation as soon as 1994.\n\r\nRetaining all of the form and function of its predecessors, the BTR-90 adds a few new elements to the mix: it is dimensionally larger than the earlier BTR-80 with greater internal space for crew and passengers and improved survivability and protection. Power is from a turbocharged multi-fuel diesel engine developing 510 horsepower, driving power to all four axles. The driver manages his position at the front of the vehicle in the traditional way while the turret of the BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) is seated directly aft with full 360-degree traversal.

They are eight-wheeled lightly armored systems capable of off road and amphibious travel and can field up to seven combat-ready personnel into battle. The BTR-70 features improvements over the preceding BTR-60 design in the way of a more powerful engine, power-to-weight ratio and side firing ports for the passengers. The system is still in active service with a variety of operators around the world.\n\r\nOutwardly, the BTR-70 retains the look of the BTR series as a whole and follows along the lines of the BTR-60PB model. Armor is sloped on the front, sides and rear of the vehicle and eight large rubber road wheels are present (four to a side) with the front four being power assisted. A tire pressure regulation system ensures proper balance. A crew of three is standard and seating for up to seven passengers is available via an entry/exit door along the side of the hull between road wheels two and three. The vehicle's commander sits at front along with the driver. The sloped-armored turret (standard on the base model - some models remove the turret based on specialty) sits to the front top portion of the hull with a primary armament of 14.5mm KPVT heavy caliber machine gun and a secondary 7.62mm PKT anti-infantry machine gun. The turret is manually traversed but has a field of fire covering 360 degrees and is the same weapon system as found on the BRDM-2 scout car and BTR-60PB armored personnel carriers. The troop compartment makes up most of the rear portion of the hull which also includes the engines. Power is generally derived from gasoline engines developing about 120 horsepower each, allowing for ideal road speeds of up to 80 kilometers per hour.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BTR-70", "vehicle_type": "8x8 Wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "b64d022b-27bd-4486-9c50-ee7651c6dac8", "year_model": "1987", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BTR-80 was the logical evolution of the wheeled armored personnel carrier (APC) BTR series that more or less hit its stride in the 1960s with the development of the BTR-60. The BTR-80 itself was developed to replace both the BTR-60 and the similar BTR-70 models and entered production in 1986, seeing operational service soon after. The BTR-80 was based on the lessons learned from the design and operation of the BTR-70 and incorporated several key strengths of its design while bringing into the fold various technological suites as required by today's battlefield environments.\n\r\nTaking the BTR-70 as a starting point, Soviet engineers did away with the twin gasoline engine setup of the former BTR-60 and BTR-70 designs and instead fitted a single V-form 8-cylinder KamAZ-7403 series diesel engine to deliver 260 horsepower at 2,600rpm. The characteristic eight road wheel arrangement was retained. The implementation of the new powerplant required some restructuring of the rear engine compartment which raised the rear hull line. Modernized sighting devices (nightvision to both the driver and the commander) were installed as was an infra-red search light. Armament was fitted to a revised, low-profile one-man turret and given 360-degree traverse and 60+ degrees elevation to counter low flying aircraft and engage targets even if the vehicle was hampered along sloped terrain. Primary armament came in the form of a 14.5mm KPVT anti-aircraft heavy machine gun supported by a 7.62mm PKT general purpose machine gun.\n\r\nThe standard operating crew included the driver, commander and gunner while up to eight combat ready soldiers could be ferried in relative safety in the revised fighting compartment. The driver and commander were situated at the front of the hull under the shallow glacis plate while the gunner manned the powered turret system. Passengers could take part in a given firefight thanks to the inclusion of rounded firing ports complete with ball mounts located at the side (three each side) and front facings of the hull. The vehicle's operating weight was listed at nearly 15,000kg while displaying a running length of 7.65 meters, a width of 2.90 meters and a height of 2.35 meters. Independent suspension and drive power was afforded to all eight wheels and operational ranges were listed out to 600 kilometers. Steering was assisted at the front four wheels only. A centralized tire air pressure system maintained the required levels to all eight wheel systems and was controlled by the driver for when managing varied terrain \"on-the-fly\".\n\r\nThe BTR-80 was designed with a certain level of self-survivability in mind and could manage to lose two of its eight road wheels and still keep itself viable. Top speed was 80 kilometers on smooth paved surfaces, lesser on rough and uneven terrain. The BTR-80 was given amphibious capabilities and could traverse relatively calm waters at roughly 9 kilometers per hour with its integrated water jet propulsion system that required no outward preparation by the crew. The crew was also protected in the event of nuclear fallout and chemical weapons by a new Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) suite and a pressurized fighting compartment. Six 81mm smoke grenade dischargers were fitted to the rear of the turret and set to fire forwards for self-protection in a combat environment. Armor was designed heavy enough to deflect or stop small arms fire and artillery spray but was not specifically designed to withstand direct hits from larger caliber weapons, rocket grenades or anti-tank missile weapons. Troops exited/entered the BTR-80 hull through split doors found on the hull sides between the forward and rearward wheel pairings (between axles two and three). Each door was split horizontally with the upper portion hinged to open forwards and the lower portion folded down to become a step capable of supporting the weight of a soldier. A third door section along the hull roof could similarly flip upwards (towards centerline) for increased headroom and speedy insertion/extractions.\n\r\nOnce in service, the BTR-80 had proven a winner for the Red Army, with off-road performance equal to that of any tracked vehicle systems coupled with excellent on-road performance. Where it lacked in protection and firepower (not its specifically designed forte) it made up for in mobility and speed. Such was the success of the BTR-80 that it went into service with a plethora of national armies the world over including Columbia, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, North Korea and South Korea among others. The Ukrainians took initiative and branched their BTR-80 series family into further improved indigenous lines to benefit their mobile army units. The BTR-80 chassis has also proven highly adaptable to the fitting of various armament types (machine guns, cannons) as well as flexible enough for several required battlefield roles to include that of command vehicle, battlefield ambulance, signals vehicle and mobile communications station.\n\r\nA new YaMZ-238M2 engine was introduced into the BTR-80 line in 1993, further enhancing inherent capabilities. As of this writing, at least 5,000 BTR-80s have been placed into service with 35 countries.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BTR-80", "vehicle_type": "Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "ad345e6d-48a9-4372-80fb-892732aec1f1", "year_model": "2004", "description": "\r\n        \tOne of the most important vehicles of the Soviet Union during the Cold War (1947-1991) became the BTR series of 8x8 wheeled, amphibious Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs). The line began with the BTR-40 armored truck of the 1950s and advanced into the tracked BTR-50 of 1954 (both detailed elsewhere on this site). In 1959 there debuted the definitive 8x8 wheeled form as the BTR-60 and this was followed by the improved BTR-70 (1972) and BTR-80 (1986) models. In the 1990s, the line was evolved once more, becoming the all-modern BTR-90, still in service with Russian Army (Internal Troops) forces today (2017).\n\r\nThe BTR-90 saw development begin in the early 1990s (about 1994) by the Arzamas Machine Building Plant, otherwise known as \"AMZ\" (part of GAZ). A pilot form became available for testing and evaluation as soon as 1994.\n\r\nRetaining all of the form and function of its predecessors, the BTR-90 adds a few new elements to the mix: it is dimensionally larger than the earlier BTR-80 with greater internal space for crew and passengers and improved survivability and protection. Power is from a turbocharged multi-fuel diesel engine developing 510 horsepower, driving power to all four axles. The driver manages his position at the front of the vehicle in the traditional way while the turret of the BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) is seated directly aft with full 360-degree traversal.

The original system was developed to serve in support of motorized rifle elements equipped with the BTR series of wheeled Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs). On the whole, the D-30 became a largely conventional artillery piece, reliable and robust under battlefield conditions, making it a favorite of Soviet allied nations and states during the Cold War decades. It still serves in surprising numbers on today's battlefields (2015).\n\r\nThe D-30 is cleared to fire standard FRAG-HE (FRAGmentation, High-Explosive) and HEAT-FS (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank, Fin-Stabilized) rounds. It is also capable of launching chemical rounds including TNT-detonated Sarin gas types. Rocket-Assisted Projectiles (RAP) extend the range of the weapon to that of 21,900 meters (13.6 miles). Sustained fire by a capably trained and well experienced gunnery crew can reach 4-8 rounds per minute. The gun has an elevation / depression limit of +70/-7 degrees and indirect fire and direct fire is possible. The gun mounting hardware sits atop a tripod base which also serves as the two-wheeled tow unit. Traversal is a full 360-degrees from centerline. Recoil is handled through a hydopneumatic system.\n\r\nAs with other artillery pieces, the D-30 is towed into action. For Russian (and related forces), the primary mover vehicle has been the tracked MT-LB or Ural-375 wheeled vehicle though many other haulers are possible replacement candidates. Design of the weapon system has been attributed to F.F. Petrov with manufacture through the Motovilikha Plant.\n\r\nSeveral variants have been manufactured beyond the original D-30 - which also carried the designator of \"2A18\". The weapon has been produced locally by China, Croatia, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia (Serbia), and Sudan resulting in various localized designations appearing. The Egyptian D-30-M model has been featured in the Egyptian Self-Propelled Gun (SPG) platform as the SPH-122 (American M109 howitzer chassis) and T-122 (Soviet T-34 tank chassis). \r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "D-30 / 2A18 (Model 1963)", "vehicle_type": "122mm Towed Field Howitzer"}, {"id": "7340eac1-52e2-404a-a436-dc61c4ec1e4a", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe DT-30 (Vityaz) is a lightly-armored, tracked, multi-purpose battlefield vehicle originating from the Soviet Cold War era and continues to provide service with the Russian Army today. Design work on the vehicle began in 1971 which led to serial production models coming off the Ishimbai Transport Machine-Building Plant assembly lines by 1982. The near-60-ton design offers excellent off-road mobility and undertakes heavy-cargo carrier roles for the service.\n\r\nThe vehicle was born out of a Soviet need in the 1960s for increased mobility, particularly as a war against the West in Europe was all but inevitable - requiring the mammoth Soviet Army to cut across the European landscape in short order. What was needed was a heavy hauler to carry across these landscapes heavier loads than what was currently being offered by in-service systems of same function. The result was the oversized Vityaz with its wide beam, low ground pressure, and articulated rear section to relatively easily move cargo from Point A to Point B.\n\r\nState trials involving the prototype vehicles DT-LP and DT-L then followed, resulting in the DT-30 articulated vehicle being approved for widespread production and service. What the Soviet Army received was a product capable of operating in extreme weather conditions and on soft terrain, making it ideal for operations in the Arctic, Antarctica, and the unforgiving northern territories of the vast Soviet expanse. Even the Oil and Gas industry went on to benefit from this rugged \"go-anywhere\" vehicle.\n\r\nStructurally, dimensions include a running length of 45 feet, a width of 9.2 feet, and a height of 8.10 feet. All-welded construction makes up the hull. Inside there is a standard operating crew of two and the engine sits behind the crew compartment, the powerplant being a 12-cylinder engine coupled to a manual transmission system. Externally, each track side features six road wheels and the drive sprocket sits at front with the track idler at rear. The rear hull component also mimics this track-an-wheel arrangement for consistency. Access to the cabin is through hinged, automobile-style doors and the short hull nose offers an elevated, commanding view of the terrain ahead - viewed through three rectangular window panes each having their own windshield wiper. Headlamps are positioned over the cabin and at the front of the hull for low-light/night time driving. Ground clearance is excellent making the vehicle ideal for cross-country/uneven terrain travel and even amphibious crossings. The forward unit can operate even if the rear component has failed. The DT-10P variant weighs in at 31 tons while the DT-30 is a hefty 58 tons.\n\r\nNo defensive armament as the DT-30 is essentially a logistics support vehicle - though personal weapons can be carried by the crew.

The vehicle shares some broad physical similarities with the American offering and has the same multirole, multipurpose, all-terrain battlefield functionality as its competing design.\n\r\nThe Tigr was first showcased to the public during IDEX 2001.\n\r\nThe vehicle is a 16,000lb machine with an overall length of 19 feet, a width of 7.9 feet and a height to the hull roof of 7.9 feet. The forward windscreen is of a two-section arrangement with the sides of the vehicle featuring thick rectangular vision ports. The hull roof line is flat and can mount the optional gun position as in the HUMVEE. Entry/exit for the occupants is by way of hinged, automobile-style doors. The vehicle is suspended atop a torsion bar suspension system for off-road travel and comfort with its four large road wheels set to the extreme corners of the chassis for strong balance. Armor protection ranges from 5mm to 7mm depending on configuration.\n\r\nPower for the Tigr is served through various American Cummins diesel-fueled offerings in the 6-cylinder mold as well as a YaMZ-534 4-cylinder model. Output ranges from 180- to 215-horsepower depending on installation. The engine is mated to a GAZ JSC 5-speed manual transmission and can alternatively be paired with the Allison LCT-1000 automatic series or the GM 545RFE line. Operational ranges reach 620 miles on internal fuel with a maximum road speed of 87 miles per hour on roads and 50 miles per hour off-road. The driver sits at the front-left of the passenger cabin with a passenger seat to his right over the center console containing the transmission control.\n\r\nArmament is variable and generally based on mission need.

Introduced in 2013, the KAMAZ product is built by Zaschita of Russia.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "KAMAZ BPM-97 (Boyevaya Pogranichnaya Mashina)", "vehicle_type": "4x4 Armed Reconnaissance Vehicle"}, {"id": "7460d561-2af5-4965-b4e0-31b12c1f9908", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tAs the battlefield has become more mobile, the Russian Army has modernized and equipped with various wheeled vehicles that includes the 4x4 wheeled \"BPM-97\" (detailed elsewhere on this site) and its lengthened 6x6 wheeled counterpart, the SBA-60K2 \"Bulat\" - both manufactured by KAMAZ in Russia. The SBA-60K2 harkens back to the Soviet Cold War period when the BTR-152, with its long 6x6 wheelbase, permeated the Soviet inventory from the 1950s onward. Some 15,000 of this design were completed before the end of its production run.\n\r\nThe SBA-60K2 \"Bulat\" is an all-modern offering, designed along the lines of an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC). The vehicle weighs in between 16 and 19.5 tons depending on mission load out and armament fit and has a running length of 8 meters with a beam of 2.5 meters and a height of 2.6 meters. Internally, there is an operating crew of two with seating for eight combat-ready troops. If armed, the vehicle carries a 7.62mm or 12.7mm machine gun in a Remote Weapon Station (RWS) over the hull roof. The engine is installed at the bow with the driver at front-left.\n\r\nThe chassis is based in the KAMAZ-5360 6x6 wheeled military truck with an all-new angled armored hull superstructure fitted. The hull features entry/exit points at the sides and rear while firing ports are provided for the passengers. The roof line contains six roof hatches. An air conditioning system is standard.\n\r\nDrive power is from a KamAZ-740.31-240 turbocharged diesel-fueled engine of 240 horsepower coupled to a 6x6 wheeled arrangement. The engine is coupled to a 10-speed manual gearbox. Road speeds can reach up to 90 kmh with an operational range out to 800 kilometers.\n\r\nWhile lightly armored, the SBA-60K2 includes several survival features: bullet-resistant windows, a central tire inflation / regulation system, fire suppression system, optional 360-degree camera, and powered winch. The angled armor plates give basic ballistics protection as well while the hull armor is V-shaped to deflect blasts occurring under the car - enhancing crew and passenger survivability to an extent. Mine-resistant seats are also given to the occupants.\n\r\nDevelopment of the design began in 2010 and series production followed in 2013 and the line takes an active presence in the modern Russian Army. Zaschita assists in the production effort. At least 65 of the vehicles are in service (2020).\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "KAMAZ SBA-60K2 Bulat", "vehicle_type": "6x6 Wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "606ff484-30b5-432f-a6f7-a4fcec2ed3fc", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tThe KAMAZ Tornado-G is a mobile, self-propelled, wheeled Multiple-Launch Rocket System (MLRS) developed by local Russian industry for the Russian Army.

The rear section seats the 122mm rocket-launching pack atop a traversing / elevating mount for true 360-dergee fields of fire. This is tactically sound in that the truck does not need to face the direction of fire at any one point in the action. The launcher component is available in two distinct forms - 1 x 40 version and a 2 x 15 version. The chassis relies on a 6x6 wheeled arrangement with a single, steerable axle at front and two fixed axles at the rear supporting the bulk of the rocket launcher pack's weight. Ground clearance is excellent and the chassis is designed for cross-country mobility. Protection is very minimal, however, for these weapon systems are not intended for direct-combat, front-line operation.\n\r\nThe Tornado-G fires the 9M538, 9M539, and 9M541 rocket types which can carry variable warhead types including High-Explosive, FRAGmentation (HE-FRAG), Anti-Personnel (AP), and the like.

Due to its wheeled nature, the system is inherently mobile, transported on the chassis of the BAZ-6910-22 four-axle, 8-wheeled military truck. In-the-field, the complete solution is used to counter / target enemy frequencies and signals. Production of the Krasukha has been ongoing since 2010 by the KRET Corporation and known variants include the 1L269 \"Krasukha-2\" and 1RL257 \"Krasukha-4\" models, these featuring an operational range of 155 miles (250 km) and 185 miles (300 km), respectively. The truck component is manufactured by the Bryansk Automobile Plant.\n\r\nElectronic Warfare is just one layer of a complex modern war which sees all manner of airborne, land-based, and ocean-going elements at play. The Krasukha is designed to counter the capabilities of radars deployed by such units in an active campaign, providing an active, mobile defense against guided missile attack, reconnaissance drones, enemy AWACS, and spy satellites as well as those systems receiving signals via GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) such as drones. The system relies on a multi-functional jamming component to target radar frequencies and radio-emitting sources while the physical section of the unit employs a series of radar dishes, antenna, and sensors atop a traversing mount.\n\r\nThe first major deployment of the Krasukha EW system is believed to have been during Syrian Civil War (2011-Present) by Russian forces supporting the Syrian regime. Since them, they are believed to have played a more limited role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenian and Azerbaijan. More recently, the jammer has been deployed during the Russian invasion of neighboring Ukraine (February 2022- Present).\n\r\nGlobal operators of the Krasukha system beyond the Russian Federation include long-time Soviet-Russian allies in Algeria, Iran, Libya, and Serbia.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Krasukha MEWC", "vehicle_type": "Mobile Electronic Warfare Complex"}, {"id": "f2c73c46-0496-466f-ae36-b7ca7e60c6a9", "year_model": "1950", "description": "\r\n        \tBefore the arrival of surface-to-air, anti-aircraft missiles, nations depended on simple artillery-based guns to protect airspace. All of the major participants of World War 2 understood the value of these close-in defensive network systems and the Soviets proved no exception. At the end of the war, development continued on more powerful and capable anti-aircraft artillery systems to combat the forces of the West. These endeavors eventually produced the \"KS-19\" series of 100mm caliber in the late 1940s. The 100mm systems were intended to replace the aged 85mm systems then in use. Design of the KS-19 was attributed to L.V. Lulyev and these guns saw considerable combat actions in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, naturally on the side of the communists. Approximately 5,000 KS-19 guns were produced - some still seeing frontline active service with nations today.\n\r\nDesign-wise, the KS-19 was highly conventional in its approach and clearly showcased its World War 2 influence based on German and Soviet experiences. The system consisted of several major components making up the overall weapon which included the barrel, gun mount, platform and the transport carriage. The 100mm (3.94inch) barrel was of notable length and rifled for accuracy, further capped by a multi-baffled muzzle brake that dispelled gases away from the gun and crew. The barrel was set within a heavy duty mount which contained the recoil mechanism, elevation/traverse controls and gunnery platform for the operating crew. The carriage was wheeled with single rubber tires fitted to each corner of the assembly along steel rims with a folding vehicle tow loop installation at one end. Recoil absorbing \"legs\" were extended from the carriage sides and lowered for a firmer firing stance. Elevation was limited to +85/-3 degrees with a 360-degree traverse, this accomplished manually via various hand wheels. The crew would sit behind a small-area armored shield for some basic protection though no overhead, side or rear protection was given from the elements or battlefield dangers. The vehicle was traditionally towed by a heavy duty Soviet military tractor for it weighed over 21,000lbs and sported a 31 foot length to which the gun barrel was locked down for transport at one end of the carriage assembly. The firing action of the KS-19 consisted of a semi-automatic, horizontal sliding wedge breechblock system with a powered rammer and an automatic fuse-setter. All of this was tied to a PUAZO-6/19 directional system and a SON-9 series fire control radar array. The KS-19 crew consisted of no fewer than 15 personnel making up the various gunnery specialists, traverse/elevation personnel, ammunition handlers and setup/take down crew.\n\r\nAs an anti-aircraft defense weapon, the KS-19 was issued standardized high-explosive (HE), high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG) and general fragmentation (FRAG) type single-piece, ready-to-fire projectiles. These served the weapon system well in their timed, area-detonated action in which the skies could be littered with exploding devices as enemy aircraft attempted to traverse the targeted airspace. Furthermore, the Soviets - like the wartime Germans before them - found the KS-19s inherent  firepower and penetration values suitable for the anti-armor role and developed equally suitable Armor-Piercing Tracer (AP-T) and Armor-Piercing Capped Tracer (APC-T) projectiles for this specific role. The KS-19 was also cleared to fire other like-minded 100mm-based projectiles as needed from the Soviet inventory, expanding its tactical, logistical and battlefield usefulness even more. A well-trained and experienced crew could let off up to 15 rounds per minute, provided good barrage fire into the sky - especially when linked to a network of such gun systems in defense of a given target area. Ranges against aircraft were out to 49,200 feet utilizing the proximity fuse and approximately 41,600 feet with the timed fuse. When used in the anti-armor role, the gun - now being fired horizontally as opposed to vertically - fielded a range of up to 13 miles.\n\r\nThe \"KS-19M2\" was one known variant of the KS-19 family line.

The weapon has been in service globally since the early-1970s and continues to be found on modern battlefields as a secondary solution.\n\r\nThe complete system utilizes a single-axle, twin-wheeled suspended carriage that features its own anchor / counter balance, sighting device, and elevation gear. The mounting hardware allows the barrel to take a \"muzzle-up\" stance when ready-to-fire and traversal of the gun tube is 18-degrees from centerline with an elevation span of +45 to +65 degrees.

After the war, the concepts proven in battle were furthered to all new levels. During the Cold War years, a slew of armored vehicles emerged with various battlefield roles in mind and one of these creations became the MT-LB multirole tracked vehicle. Development began in the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West, to which the completed vehicle was adopted sometime in the latter part of the decade. Once identified by the West, the vehicle was designated in NATO nomenclature as the \"M1970\" (\"Model 1970\").\n\r\nThe MT-LB was developed as a direct replacement for the aged AT-P artillery tractor line. The design was largely formed from the work that also begat the successful PT-76 Amphibious Light Tank which was produced in over 12,000 examples. The initial product was the MT-L which then evolved to become the armored MT-LB. Production was assisted by the type utilizing many off-the-shelf components in circulation, and readily available, to the Soviet Army at the time. Manufacture was headed through the famous Kharkov tractor facility. The designation of \"MT-LB\" is born from the Russian translation describing \"Multi-Purpose, Light-Armored Towing Vehicle\".\n\r\nOne of the key qualities required of most any Soviet armored vehicle was amphibious support allowing the vehicle to cross moving water sources under its own power. The alternative was traversing bridges and similar checkpoints or arranging for engineers to construct a make-shift bridge over the span of hours and maybe days. The MT-LB was designed with this quality in mind, fully-amphibious, and propelled in the water by its own tracks, negating the need to activate a dedicated propulsion system.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "MT-LB (M1970)", "vehicle_type": "Multi-Purpose Tracked Vehicle"}, {"id": "3a1f9040-8a0d-4d37-a375-e75849722561", "year_model": "2011", "description": "\r\n        \tThe future battlefield looks to be robot-driven and Russian ground forces appear to be moving in that direction quicker than most.

The type has been featured in Russian war games to date (2018) and adds an interesting element within existing modern Russian infantry doctrine. The vehicle is manufactured by the Degtyarev Plant of Russia and was first demonstrated in 2016. Testing of the product ensued in 2017 by Russian ground forces. It was further demonstrated at Army 2018.\n\r\nThe vehicle is of relatively compact form with an overall length of 2.5 meters, a width of 1.6 meters and a height of 900 meters. Its weight reaches 1,700 kilograms while its payload capacity is set around 700 kilograms. The vehicle sports the general appearance of a small tank, with its track-and-wheel arrangement seen on both sides of a low-profile hull. There are four double-tired road wheels to a hull side with the drive fitted aft and the track idler at front. Two track return rollers are used. Over center of the hull roof is a trainable, traversing weapons mount which sports a single (optional)  12.7mm Kord Heavy Machine Gun (HMG), Kalashnikov 7.62mm Medium Machine Gun (MMG) or 30mm AG-30M Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL). For the transport role, this fitting is removed to make space for externally-mounted cargo. An operator is required for the proper battlefield function of this system and range of the remote-control is approximately 20,000 meters (extendable by way of mast assembly).

At least twelve of the eighty-four deployed missiles are fixed, silo-based versions, leaving the remainder as mobile launch platforms.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "RS-24 Yars (SS-29)", "vehicle_type": "Mobile InterContinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Carrier Vehicle"}, {"id": "d660e899-89f0-44e7-b733-10332f0071dd", "year_model": "1978", "description": "\r\n        \tThe S-300 (NATO designation and codename of SA-10 \"Grumble) is a long-range surface-to-air missile system developed in the latter decades of the Cold War (1947-1991) years. The system was designed specifically to content with the rise in use of cruise missile weapons originating from the West which would have been used in the opening rounds of a full-scale war with the Soviet Union. The S-300 missile was developed by MKB from the period beginning in 1967 and entered Soviet military service in 1978. Consistent modernization programs have kept the S-300 series a viable battlefield instrument which, coupled to its powerful radar system, has let it remain a potent anti-aircraft defender despite its Cold War root. An export-minded version has also ensured its place among many global operators (mostly those with Soviet Cold war-era roots). The S-300 is comparable in its battlefield qualities and scope to the American MIM-104 \"Patriot\" battery and is now competing with designs such as the Chinese HQ-9 system recently adopted by Turkey over the Russian product.\n\r\nThe S-300 missiles are generally fielded through multiple-cell launchers which are fitted horizontally atop heavy industry trucks for mobility. The typical photographed transporter is an 8-wheeled vehicle with front-mounted engine and driving cabin offset to the left side of the chassis. The vehicle is deployed with its own dedicated radar vehicle to provide the scanning and tracking prowess required. When ready to launch, the launcher component of the vehicles is raised to a vertical position with setup time for the system being just five minutes. While the 8x8 chassis is typically used, the launchers can be set upon any wheeled or tracked vehicle capable of carrying the launcher's weight.\n\r\nThe S-300 missile and phased array radar series is highly-regarded in air-defense circles for its potency, even against modern aerial systems. Its radar can track upwards of 100 individual targets and can engage any twelve of them with improved qualities against any launched countermeasures. However, it deserves mention that no S-300 launcher/missile has been used in anger in any modern conflict to date (2013). Primary S-300 series missiles are the 9M82, 9M83 and 9M83ME reaching speeds in excess of 5,400 miles per hour and engagement altitudes of 98,000 feet depending on variant. These missiles carry a warhead of 330lb with guidance offered by a semi-active radar homing feature. Other missile types are also available, broadening the tactical value and foreign appeal of the S-300 family considerably.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-10 (Grumble) / S-300", "vehicle_type": "Long-Range Anti-Aircraft Mobile Defense System"}, {"id": "bfb81052-4366-4a18-b2bc-4056116dd863", "year_model": "1979", "description": "\r\n        \tThe vast airspace over the Russian frontier and the combat-ready atmosphere of the Cold War required the Soviet Army to keep large collections of mobile surface to air missile platforms on hand. To further its reach, these systems were often times sold overseas to allied nations or satellite parties within the Soviet sphere of influence - intended to create all manner of headaches for Western warplanners, primarily the Americans. In 1970, the Soviet Army ushered in the SA-6 \"Gainful\" tracked mobile missile-based anti-aircraft system to counter low-to-medium flying threats - principally low-flying aircraft and helicopters. In the early 1970s, however, thought was already being given to complementing the existing system with a more advanced type capable of engaging all manner of threats at medium altitudes including cruise missiles. In 1972, Soviet government commissioned for such a system and its design would serve both land- and sea-based assets - the former in its basic tracked form and the latter in launcher only.\n\r\nOne of the key design detriments of the SA-6 Gainful series was multiple launchers reliant on a single fire control radar. The new missile system would, therefore, feature its own integrated fire control radar for improved tactical value. The 9M38 \"Buk\" missile was designed for placement atop a tracked chassis containing six double-tired road wheels to a track side with a rear-mounted drive sprocket. The completed system would sport a 360-degree traversing launch platform (with powered elevation) mounting 4 x 9M38 missiles.\n\r\nThe new missile system was evaluated during a period spanning 1977 into 1979 to which limited examples made their way into Soviet Army service in time until the system was formally cleared for service in 1980 (designated as the \"9K37-1 Buk-1\"). The requisite navalized variant became the 3S-90 \"Uragan\" and this followed in 1983. Recognition by NATO observers in the West produced the SA-11 \"Gadfly\" designation.\n\r\nThe complete systems package was designed around the 9M38 missile (later the 9M317 missile) which was powered by a solid propellant rocket motor. It sported an operational range out to 20 miles with a defended airspace up to 46,000 feet. The missile relied upon a semi-active radar homing guidance suite and detonated through a radar-based proximity fuse utilizing a fragmentation-high-explosive warhead in the nose cone. Stabilization fins were noted along the missile sides. Overall weight of individual missiles was 700kg. Each missile sported a running length of 5.55 meters. The benefit of such a system was its capability to be fired from various launch platforms not limited to a mobile, land-based vehicle. As such, fixed and naval variants could be developed from the basic design.\n\r\nBy 1983, the 9K37 family was modernized which subsequently led to development and acceptance of and improved missile with improved radar and further protection from enemy jamming signals intended to disrupt the service. The Soviet Army formally adopted this version in 1983 and an export mark then followed. Another modernization effort introduced an improved missile type - the 9M317 - that saw acceptance in 1998 and forced NATO to create the all-new SA-17 \"Grizzly\" designation to differentiate the two major production types. The Grizzly had the capability to track and intercept ballistic missiles in-air so range, accuracy and power were all improved. The land-based variant also ushered in an equivalent navalized form. A new missile with advanced capabilities was introduced in 2007. A vertical launch unit has also been developed.\n\r\n9K37 weapons were credited with the downing of at least four Georgian aerial drones during the fighting between Russia and Georgia during the South Ossetia War of 2008. Conversely, Georgian 9K37 systems downed four Russian aircraft in turn. During the conflict, the 9K37 proved its value to a very good extent. Despite its 1970s origins, the modernized forms could still keep pace with more modern aircraft and their respective countermeasures.\n\r\nBelarus and China have both produced localized copies of the Soviet/Russian 9K37 missile defense family. Both have been modernized in their own respective ways to keep them viable on the modern battlefield. Global operators of the Soviet/Russian design proper have included Belarus, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, Georgia (by way of Ukraine), North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, and Venezuela. Russia maintains approximately 250 examples on hand.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-11 (Gadfly) / 9K37 Buk", "vehicle_type": "Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System"}, {"id": "974e0fcb-70d3-4a7b-a06a-8da771215f64", "year_model": "1988", "description": "\r\n        \tThe S-300V (NATO codename of SA-12 Gladiator or Giant) was developed by the Soviets during the Cold War period (1947-1991) as part of the wider-ranging S-300 Anti-Aircraft (AA) Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) defensive-minded line of vehicles. This series, however, ultimately emerged as a completely different form from the multi-wheeled S-300 airspace denial units. It was given to a different developer and manufacturer than those of the S-300 family while featuring altogether different missiles - the 9M82 \"Giant\" and the 9M83 \"Gladiator\". Two- and four-shot launcher forms were devised and the types have been fielded in the anti-ballistic missile role while also being able to provide protection against inbound aerial threats - such as aircraft and cruise missiles - at long range. It still sees service on today's battlefields despite its Cold War roots.\n\r\nThe S-300V series was taken into service in 1983 and full-strength was eventually before the end of the decade; around 1988.\n\r\nThe S-300V utilizes the chassis of the MT-T carrier tracked combat vehicle. The tracked nature of this chassis allows it to travel cross-country easily enough while keeping pace with the main mechanized fighting force. Over the top of the vehicle are large launch tubes housing the primary armament of 9M82 \"Giant\" or 9M83 series missiles and the launcher is hinged along the rear edge of the hull and propped upwards when the tubes are made ready-to-fire. The missiles can not only engage at long range but also high altitude - making them doubly-dangerous. A typical SA-12 arrangement in the Soviet/Russian ranks is up to six of these launcher vehicles assigned with a target detection/designation vehicle.\n\r\nChina has produced a local variant of the S-300V as the \"HQ-18\".\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-12 (Gladiator / Giant) / S-300V", "vehicle_type": "Long-Range, High-Altitude Self-Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System"}, {"id": "e25b9667-6d36-4fc5-b832-a22c458eac35", "year_model": "1979", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9K35 \"Strela-10\" was developed by Soviet engineers to replace the 1960s-era 9K31 Strela-1 line (SA-9 \"Gaskin\") of mobile Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) systems in service with the Red Army during the Cold War years. It was a budget alternative to more technology-laden programs of the period and therefore somewhat limited in terms of overall engagement capabilities. It lacked all-weather functionality though its more direct operator participation (it is optically-aimed and guided) made its engagement of aerial targets far less prone to jamming and evasion. Development work began in 1969 by KB Tochmash Design Bureau of Precision Engineering to which the 9K35 was taken into service in 1979. To NATO, the vehicle was known as the SA-13 \"Gopher\". It continues to see use today (2014), having been taken on by forces ranging from Afghanistan and Angola to Ukraine and Vietnam. Former operators include Czechoslovakia (dissolution), Poland, Slovakia, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia (dissolution). Modern Russian Army versions use a new missile.\n\r\nThe 13.55-ton SA-13 is built atop the existing hull and chassis of a slightly modified MT-LB multipurpose armored tracked carrier and therefore retains the same YaMZ-238 V diesel-fueled 240 horsepower engine and performance specifications of 37 miles per hour road speeds and 310 mile operational ranges. A torsion bar suspension allows for the necessary off-road capability and the hull is amphibious as in the original MT-LB, treading water at a 3-mile-per-hour-clip. Its crew numbers three - commander, driver, and gunner and armor protection is only against small arms fire, measuring 7mm thick. Primary armament is its four-shot 9M333 missile launcher which sits atop the hull on a trainable mount. The launchers are grouped as two pairs of launchers in a side-by-side format, the pairing separated by the radar array at center. The mounting hardware features full traversal and elevation controls. The launcher can also fire the older missiles of the Streal-1 family.\n\r\nThe original missile was the 9M31M of 1971 which used an impact and proximity fuse. This was followed by the 9M37 of 1976 and its proximity and impact fuse. Then came the 9M37M of 1981 and the 9M333 of 1989 - the latter introducing an eight-ray laser proximity and impact fuse. Maximum range has been progressively increased over the lifespan of the missile's evolution while minimum intercept altitudes have been steadily increased.\n\r\nOver the decades, the Strela-10 system has been continually improved to help expand its battlefield usefulness. This has produced the Strela-10M, Strela,10M2, and Strela-10M3 marks. Its combat service has ranged from the Angolan War (1975-2002) and Operation Desert Storm (1991) to the Kosovo War (1998-1999) and others though with mixed results.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-13 (Gopher) / 9K35 Strela-10", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled, Tracked SAM System"}, {"id": "b6188f7a-f8fa-4901-a6ad-16504b13c93b", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tWith the rise of ever-faster and more powerful warplanes in the 1960s and 1970s, the missile age was forged as a direct counter. This led both the East and West of the Cold War period (1947-1991) to fund development of all manner of missile-based defenses. For the Soviet Union, this led to the creation of a new self-propelled Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system known as the 9K330 'Tor' (NATO codename of SA-15 \"Gauntlet\"). The system was specifically designed to engage aerial targets in the low-to-medium altitude envelopes - making it ideal for area defense.\n\r\nDesign work began in 1975 with Antey OKB leading the charge aided by MKB Fakel supplying the missile component. Manufacture of the series, introduced in 1986, was undertaken by IEMZ Kupol, Metrowagonmash (managing production of the tracked chassis), and MZKT (providing a wheeled chassis derivative). Production of the line has since spanned from 1983 until the present day and variants of the series now include the original 'Tor' and subsequent notable marks of enhanced capability - the 9K330 has been progressively modernized to keep it a viable air-defense missile platform for the foreseeable future.\n\r\nAt its core, the 9K330 features an operating crew of three and weighs in at 34 tonnes in its tracked chassis guise. Overall length of the chassis reaches 7.5 meters with a beam of 3.3 meters and a height up to the hull roof line of 5.1 meters. The tracking radar sits atop the hull and can be stowed away during transport. Power is from a V-12 diesel -fueled engine of 830 horsepower driving the conventional track-and-wheel running gear, the engine being mated to a hydromechanical gearbox. The hull is suspended atop a proven torsion bar suspension system ideal for offroad traveling and the vehicle complete can reach road speeds of up to 65 kmh and operate out to ranges of 500 kilometers - allowing it to keep up with the main mechanized force is need be.\n\r\nThe included solid-fueled, rocket-boosted missiles of the 9K330 SAM system are typically fielded in packs of four ready-to-launch munitions. These 10-foot long weapons are designed to engage more agile targets at range, the missiles reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Guidance is through a command-input system allowing for changes/corrections on-the-fly while detonation is through an onboard proximity fuse-based arrangement. The base missiles have a listed engagement range out to 12 kilometers giving the overall vehicle a good \"reach\" in a warzone. The weapons can target and engage enemies at altitudes beyond 30,000 feet (depending on missile mark).\n\r\nThe Tor SAM system is currently (2020) operated by the military forces of Algeria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Peru, Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela, Yemen, Morocco, and Syria. Russia is, by far, the largest operator of the series with some 172 units in service with production currently ongoing. Georgia and Kazakhstan has both given up use of the missile system.\n\r\nRussian forces deployed the Tor SAM system in the Syrian Civil War in support of the acting/current regime.\n\r\nVariants of the 9K330 SAM system include the original 9K330 'Tor' unit of 1986, these followed by the improved 9K331 'Tor M1' mark of 1991 which brought along the new 9M331 missile of greater accuracy and a multi-target engagement capability. The 9K332 'Tor-M2E' became an upgraded model of 2007 and marks the latest widespread version available - boasting an all-new, more accurate fire control capability as well as greater automation with increased reaction times. The smaller size of these missiles allow eight to be housed in a pack while engagement ranges are increased to 16 kilometers.\n\r\nThe 'Tor-M1-2U' is a model of 2012 given a broader target reach - therefore more useful against smaller UAVs becoming commonplace over the modern battlefield as well as traditional large fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. An all-weather capability is built in, increasing the tactical flexibility of the unit. This form is beginning to become available in useful numbers as of this writing.\n\r\nThe 'Tor-M2KM' is more of a versatile \"mount-anywhere\" version with a 15 kilometer engagement range while the 'Tor-M2DT' is designed for cold weather operation (particularly in the Arctic environment where weather extremes prove more common). The 'Tor-2E' is a more mobile, versatile offering being marketed along with a wheeled vehicle chassis equipped with 16-shot missile modules and intra-vehicle communications for a shared exchange of target information.\n\r\nThe navalized form of the Gauntlet became the 3K95 'Kinzhal' (exported as 'Klinok') known to NATO as SA-N-9.  These missiles were introduced in 1989 and are similar in form and function to the 9M330 land-based weapons though optimized for on-water/over-water operation against aerial targets. The weapons are typically fitted on mid-to-large Russian Navy warships.\n\r\nThe HQ-17/FM-2000 is a Chinese variant thought to be based on the Soviet/Russian Tor SAM system.\n\r\nDespite its Cold War-era roots, the Tor SAM system maintains an active presence around the world, primarily with Soviet/Russian allied partners and nations.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-15 (Gauntlet) / 9K330 Tor", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) Vehicle"}, {"id": "c0436f85-2169-49fb-b264-54328a0b0ac0", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2K22 \"Tunguska\" (NATO codename of SA-19 \"Grisom\") is a self-propelled, tracked air defense system that combines both rapid-fire automatic cannon power and surface-to-air missile capability. The targeting system relies on a radar sensor with fire control handled via IFF (Identification Friend or Foe). All of the primary tracking and engagement facilities are fitted to a traversing turret allowing for a base 360-degree arc of fire with elevation/depression at +80/-6 respectively. The vehicle is crewed by four personnel and powered by a V-46-4 turbocharged V12 water-cooled diesel engine outputting 780 horsepower. The Tunguska was developed and produced by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau between 1970 and 1980. Entering production in 1976, the Tunguska is in active service with a few forces as of this writing (2013).\n\r\nAs a tracked vehicle, the 2K22 has the inherent capability of moving off road as part of a mobile mechanized formation thanks to its engine fitting and hydropneumatic suspension system. The Tunguska features a top road speed of 40 miles per hour with an operational road range of 310 miles.

This was followed by the improved 2K22M1 of 1988 which was built upon the GM-5975 chassis and utilized a longer-range missile (9M311-M1) of 10 kilometers coupled to a modernized fire control system (FCS). The ultimate evolution of the Tunguska system is the 2K22M which features an all-new FCS and longer-range missile support (18 kilometers).\n\r\nThe 2K22 Tunguska will eventually be replaced in full within the inventory of the Russian military by the modern \"Pantsir-S1\" 8x8 wheeled anti-aircraft weapon system.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-19 (Grisom) / 2K22 Tunguska", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Air Defense System"}, {"id": "6eb9c967-ca23-4f7f-80fc-77f3c365ffd9", "year_model": "2007", "description": "\r\n        \tThe modern Russian military has made tremendous strides since the fall of the Soviet Empire - indeed it has gone on to surprise many-an-observer in the West with its latest developments. The country has long been a champion of a powerful air defense network and has keep investment in this sector strong resulting in systems such as the effective S-300 and improved 4th Generation S-400 \"Triumf\" mobile Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) series. The S-300 was introduced into the Soviet inventory in 1978 and remains a potent air defense contributor while the S-400 has been brought along as its evolved form since arriving in 2007. Both are long range systems with proven capabilities.\n\r\nThe S-400 system functions under the SA-21 \"Growler\" designation in NATO nomenclature. It is described as being twice as effective as previous SAM units of Russian origin and supports the firing of five different missile types.\n\r\nDesign of the S-400 is by the Almaz / Antei Concern of Air Defense with manufacture handled by the Fakel Machine-Building Design Bureau.  The system encompasses a 6x6 wheeled heavy-duty military truck hauling a twin axle trailer containing the launcher unit. The launcher unit seats four large missiles which elevate to a vertical position when made ready for launch. The vehicle contains the entire crew aboard and serves as part of a Russian division. Work on the S-400 series began in the latter half of the 1990s though development proved slow and fraught with technological issues (understandable for such a complex product). Testing was undertaken before the end of the decade but the original missiles had a poor showing, delaying its service entry until the latter half of the 2000s. It has since become a Russian Army mainstay.\n\r\nThe S-400 is designed to fire off five different classes of missiles covering medium-range, long-range and \"extreme-long-range\". This has led to the development of at least three distinct missile types in the 9M96, 48N6 and 40N6 supporting the S-400 system. The 9M96 holds a range out to 120 kilometers while the 48N6 reaches out to 250km and the 40N6 out to 400km. Missile speeds span Mach 2.3 to Mach 6.2 depending on missile type in play.\n\r\nDue to its wheeled arrangement, the S-400 missiles can be transported along roads easily enough, providing a harder target to track down and destroy (ala the Iraqi SCUD launchers of the Persian Gulf War). It is said to hold lethality against all manner of Western aircraft - from smaller cruise missiles and regular combat aircraft to larger bomber types and reportedly even those aircraft protected by stealth features. Off road travel is possible as well though speeds are decidedly reduced during such actions.

Such is the case with the Russian-originated \"Pantsir-1\", known to NATO as the \"SA-22 Greyhound\", a short- / medium-ranged, 8x8 wheeled, Self-Propelled (SP) Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system. The weapon system has been in active service (albeit in limited numbers) since 2003 and currently serves the Russian Army through over twenty examples as well as the army of Syria (a long-time Soviet customer). Furthermore, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan and the UAE are reported to have Pantsir-1 vehicles on order while Brazil is mentioned as a possible Pantsir-1 candidate in the near future. A naval version of the Pantsir-1 is also planned with the end-goal to equip various Russian naval destroyer warships and similar vessels with the potent defense product.\n\r\nThe Pantsir-1 is the actual surface-to-air component comprised of repeat-fire autocannons, a battery of missile launch tubes and an advanced integrated radar tracking/direction system. This component can, therefore, be affixed upon various chassis types including both wheeled and tracked as well as aforementioned warships. The wheeled version seen is a four-axle, 8x8 truck arrangement which an enclosed driving cab and attached operations cabin for the launch crew. The launcher component sits at the rear of the truck with an unfettered view of the action around the vehicle. The alternative identified form is a tracked offering with the launcher component affixed to the hull of a GM-352 vehicle. Development of the Pantsir-1 system began in 1990 as a replacement for the aging, though effective, \"Tunguska\" series anti-aircraft platforms.\n\r\nWork on a new air defense system culminated in a pilot vehicle (this on a Ural-5325 8x8 truck chassis) being unveiled in 1994. A more finalized version was showcased to potential customers during the 1995 MAKS show. However, lack of government funding slowed and ultimately shelved the project for a time until backers in the UAE provided the necessary capital to see the program through some five years later. The production model was then seen on the chassis of a KAMAZ-6560 8x8 truck and UAE Army versions were built atop the chassis of the MAN SZ 45 8x8 truck - showing the high adaptability of the Pantsir-1 system.\n\r\nThe Pantsir-1 is an all-modern, all-digital air defense weapon system coupling advanced tracking, search and engagement functionality to a hybrid cannon/missile armament to achieve high \"first-kill\" probability at short-to-medium ranges. Fixed upon the chassis of a mover vehicle, the Pantsir-1 becomes a capable mobile air defense platform ready to counter the challenges of the modern battlefield. The primary weapon system is the collection of 12 x 57E6 series radio-guided surface-to-air missiles held in four separate, three-tube launchers. The missile component is tied to 2 x 30mm 2A38M autocannons that fire can variable warhead types to suit the given defensive role. This \"one-two\" punch ensures a high kill probability against all manner of low-flying aircraft including fixed-wing, helicopters and cruise missile types. Fire control is directed by two phased-array, 360-degree coverage radar systems that reach out to detect at 36 kilometers while engagement can occur under 28 kilometers. The total vehicle crew is just three personnel - a driver for the vehicle and two system specialists for the launcher/guns.\n\r\nFirst combat use of the Pantsir-1 was through the Syrian Army when a system tracked and successfully downed an encroaching Turkish McDonnell Douglas RF-4E Phantom II reconnaissance aircraft in June of 2012. Beyond that, the exposure of the Pantsir-1 has been limited to due limited availability. That should drastically change with the number of systems currently on order - which may number as many as 250 units.\n\r\nIraq has received some Pantsir-S1 systems as part of a 48-strong deal with Russia signed in October of 2012.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-22 (Greyhound) / Pantsir-S1", "vehicle_type": "Mobile Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System (SPAAS)"}, {"id": "243238d0-9ae7-4cf0-bfa5-38215ae0b8eb", "year_model": "1970", "description": "\r\n        \tDesign work on the 2K12 \"Kub\" system began in 1959 under the direction of NIIP/Vympel (for the missile) and MMZ (for the tracked chassis) at the behest of the Soviet government. After successfully completing the requisite trials (delayed by various technological challenges), the design entered serial production in 1968 which ran until 1985. The system was formally introduced into limited Soviet Army service in 1967 before seeing widespread use by 1970 and operations concerning the unit continue with many nations even today - despite its 1970s heritage. The type has since seen successful combat actions through the Yom Kippur War, the Chad Civil War, the Iran-Iraq War, the 1st Lebanon War, the 1991 Gulf War and the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. To date at least 500 launcher units have been processed with some 10,000 missiles delivered. NATO recognized the 2K12 as the SA-6 \"Gainful\".\n\r\nDesign of the 2K12 is centered around the use of three rail-launched guided missiles utilizing an optical sight and continuous wave target illuminator. Missiles can detonate on impact or be set with a proximity fuze and hold an effective range of 15 miles against targets up to 45,930 feet in altitude. Each is powered by a solid fuel rocket motor and can reach speeds of up to Mach 2.8 which places any modern aircraft at risk. The system is categorized as a low-to-medium altitude interception device and its tracked nature assures that it can be relocated to any positions in defense of key installations. In its tracked form, the chassis makes use of six double-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear of the hull. The crew is entirely sealed in their armored vehicle while the traversing launcher - fitting the three missiles - sits atop the hull roof.\n\r\nThe 2K12 was modernized in 1973 to become the 2K12 Kub-M1. A further evolution of the system produced the improved 2K12 Kub-M3 of 1976. This was then followed by the 2K12 Kub-M4 in 1978 which was based on the 2K1 Kub-M3 and developed to work in conjunction with the newer 9K37 \"Buk\" anti-aircraft missile systems - which were inspired by the 2K12 family. The export version of the 2K12 became the 2K12E \"Kvadrat\" and these have since seen widespread use in Soviet/Russian-allied states and countries. The 3M9M1 became a variant in 1977 that was given an all-new tracked chassis, recognized by NATO as the \"SA-6B\".\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-6 / 2K12 (Gainful / Kub)", "vehicle_type": "Mobile Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) Defense System"}, {"id": "c4978980-bfe1-4fec-9365-3a597e0ca4d3", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tTo contend with ever-improving, more agile low-altitude aircraft emerging from the West during the Cold War, the Soviet military developed and ultimately adopted the 9K33 \"Osa\" (\"Wasp\") self-propelled, wheeled, amphibious Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) vehicle. It was designated \"SA-8\" and codenamed \"Gecko\" by NATO once its existence was verified. Design work by the NII-20 Research Institute spanned from 1965 into the early 1970s to which the system began formal service in 1971 (continuing today - 2014). The SA-8 has proven a combat veteran, seeing action in the Lebanon Civil War (1982), the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002), the Persian Gulf War (1991), the South Ossetia War (2008), the Libyan Civil War (2011), and the Syrian Civil War (2011-present). It is estimated that some 1,200 units have been produced with several notable variants having appeared.\n\r\nThe 19-ton system features a vehicle section with a running length of 9 meters, width of 2.75 meters and a height of 4.2 meters. It's typical operating crew is five. The vehicle consists of a lightly-armored hull form atop a 6x6 wheeled chassis. The chassis supports cross-country travel while the hull is cleared for amphibious crossings which then played well into established Soviet ground warfare doctrine (forged largely by actions in World War 2 some decades earlier). The vehicle featured a D20K300 diesel-fueled engine of 300 horsepower output which provided driving ranges out to 500 kilometers and road speeds nearing 80 kmh. In water, the vehicle managed a pedestrian 8 kmh. The driving compartment lay at front in the usual way with the launcher component was sat over the rear of the vehicle, the radar element affixed over the frontal center mass. The six road wheels, three to a hull side, were large and well-spaced for good balance while the overall hull shape was quite shallow, presenting a smaller target along the horizon. The powered launcher component fitted two groups of three short-range missile launch tubes (for a total of six missiles) in a side-by-side arrangement - the launchers separated at center the radar component.\n\r\nThe missile series of choice became the \"9M33\" mark, a weapon weighing 170 kilograms with a length over 10 feet. Its diameter was 210mm while the warhead held a High-Explosive, FRAGmentation (HI-FRAG) payload with contact and proximity detonation. Propulsion was through a solid-propellant rocket booster aided by a guidance system with dual-thrust rocket steering for fine corrections. The missile reached an altitude of 39,000 feet and range over 9 miles with speeds over 1,000 meters per second.\n\r\nAs with other Soviet-sponsored weapon systems of the Cold War, the SA-8 found its way into the inventories of many Soviet-supported states, nations, and allies. This list included Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia (later the Czech Republic), East Germany (some sold to Greece post-reunification), Ecuador, Georgia, Greece (from Germany), India, Jordan, Libya, Poland, Romania, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Kuwait also fielded the type and many were captured in the 1990 Iraq invasion - now falling to the Iraqi defense inventory. Czechoslovakian models were absorbed into the new Czech Republic defense network but eventually phased out during 2006. Similarly, Soviet SA-8s were absorbed into the new Russian Army but these were modernized to contend with newer aerial threats - about 400 or so may still be in the active inventory. Belarus, Poland, and Jordan versions have followed suit and completed local modernizations to combat emerging regional threats.\n\r\nVarious official marks have resulting from the SA-8's lengthy, still-ongoing service career. 9K33 - the designation assigned the original incarnation by the Soviets - was the model of 1972 and designated SA-8A by NATO. The 9K33M was a navalized version and known to NATO as SA-N-4. In 1975, a new missile was used on the 9K33M2 and designated by NATO as SA-8B \"Gecko Mod-0\". The 9K33M3 then appeared in 1980 with upgraded missiles and improved engagement ranges to which NATO marked it as SA-8B \"Gecko Mod-1\". Export versions were known under the local name of \"Romb\". The 9K33-1T is a Belarusian upgrade. The Osa-AKM-P1 is a Polish approach.\n\r\nLatest active use of this SAM vehicle has been in the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011 as an offshoot of the Arab Spring from the 2010 revolutions.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-8 (Gecko) / 9K33 OSA", "vehicle_type": "6x6 Wheeled Self-Propelled SAM Vehicle"}, {"id": "04c786fc-d1ed-4acb-8c8a-199fa014d293", "year_model": "1976", "description": "\r\n        \tWorld War 2 (1939-1945) finally brought to bear the power and lethality of in-direct missile strikes from one nation against another primarily through Germany's V-1/V-2 programs. In the post-war decades, the Soviets - already familiar with the inherent power of amassed formations of rocket projectors against its German foe - undertook considerable effort to bring about a plethora of missile/rocket-projecting solutions to bring to bear against the West should the Cold War ever have \"gone hot\". One of these creations, the OTR-21 \"Tochka\" (GRAU designation of \"9K79\", known to NATO as the SS-21 \"Scarab\") appeared in its original form in 1976.\n\r\nThis weapon, a 6x6 wheeled tactical ballistic missile launcher, has seen extensive combat service since, covering the clashes of the Yemeni Civil Wars (1994 and 2015), the First (1994-1996) and Second (2000-2009) Chechen wars, the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present), the War in Donbass (2014-Present), the Saudi involvement in Yemen (2015-Present), the Nagomo-Karabakh Conflict (2020), and the Russian invasion of neighboring Ukraine (2022).\n\r\nThe advancement of missiles led to larger, more powerful solutions that offered greater accuracy than that of carpeting an entire target area with rockets while still retaining the inherently terrifying psychological value. In-direct fire allows a launcher source to arc its lethal payload, from range, and rain down onto enemy positions or fixed targets, giving a tactical edge to the attacker in this scenario. The prospect of a wheeled delivery vehicle means that the system can be relocated to another firing location once resupplied with a fresh missile - however, this requires the commitment of accompanying resupply vehicles and additional support staff for optimal performance on the battlefield.\n\r\nSeries production of OTR-21 vehicles began in 1973 under the KBM (Kolomna) brand label followed by Soviet deployment of the mobile launchers in 1981 to East Germany. These were used to succeed an aging line of 9K52 \"Luna-M\" rocket projectors which arrived back in 1964.\n\r\nThe complete OTR-21 system involves a lightly-armored, all-wheel 6x6 military truck chassis capable of on-road / off-road travel seating a single missile launcher unit over the rear hull. The vehicle portion of the system is the 9P129. The rocket component - seated on the BAZ-5921 Mobile TEL launcher - is a single-stage, solid-fueled weapon with variable operational range depending on the production variant. These missiles reach speeds of Mach 5.3 and are guided to the target by inertial guidance systems (the \"Tochka-R\" version since added passive radar support to better engage radar-emitting installations).\n\r\nThe \"Scarab-A\" was the initial missile development of 1975 and could be used with High-Explosive (HE), FRAGmentation (FRAG), and nuclear warheads. These missiles featured an engagement range of about 43 miles but suffered from accuracy issues (error probability of less-than 490 feet). The \"Scarab-B\" (\"Tochka-U\") improved error probability accuracy by about 200 feet to less than 315 feet and range was enhanced to 75 miles. These missiles came online in 1989 after years of testing. B-models were then followed by the improved 'Scarab-C\" in the 1990s. Range was enhanced to 115 miles and error probability lowered to 230 feet - making for a much useful vehicle.\n\r\nMany former Soviet allies have since given up use of the OTR-21 system including Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic/Czechia), Poland, and Slovakia. However, the missile still remains in play for the forces of Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Syria, Kazakhstan, Yemen, and others. Russian Army versions have been succeeded by the 9K720 \"Iskander\" series in time.\n\r\nThe OTR-21 has seen active use in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine as Ukraine still fields it in number. About ninety were in inventory during peak usage.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SS-21 (Scarab) OTR-21 Tochka", "vehicle_type": "6x6 Wheeled Ballistic Missile Launcher Vehicle"}, {"id": "19f639e2-5b46-4396-b99c-eb5441f722e9", "year_model": "1985", "description": "\r\n        \tBeyond maintaining land-based silos and a fleet of ballistic missile launching submarines, the Russian Army also maintains a squadron (Strategic Missile Troops) of mobile ballistic missile launcher vehicles through the RT-2PM \"Topol\" design, known to NATO as the SS-25 \"Sickle\". These massive vehicles were introduced in 1985 and are in active use with the modern Russian Army.\n\r\nThe missile component began development in July of 1977 as an improved version of an InterContinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) able to reach any part of the world. It would be adopted to succeed an aging line of previous ICBM models then in inventory with the Soviet Army. By the middle of the 1980s, the missile had entered the requisite test stages and service introduction occurred that same year. Improvements made to the line followed into the 1990s to keep the weapon system a viable component of the modern battlefield.\n\r\nThe missile component carries the name of \"Topol\". it weighs some 99,400lb and has a length of 97 feet with a diameter of nearly 6 feet. The warhead is a single 800 kiloton fitting and the rocket motor a three-stage solid-fueled rocket engine. Range of the missile is out to 6,200 miles and the rocket can reach speeds of Mach 21 (16,000mph). An inertial autonomous guidance system guides the rocket along its course.\n\r\nThe carrier component of the Topol is the MZKT-79221 series ultra-heavy-duty trucks. These massive machines offer the strength and drive power needed in carrying the large ballistic missile to and fro. The vehicle's design is notable because of the multi-wheeled arrangement, seating eight axles with two-wheeled pairings each. The vehicle acts as the transporter erector launcher for the Topol missile and is a successor to the earlier MAZ-7917 vehicles, themselves having succeeded the MAZ-547 trucks of old. The operating crew is housed in a split forward cab at the front of the truck which overhangs the forward-most axle. The Topol missile itself overhangs the cab.\n\r\nThe Russian Army fields over 350 Topol missiles currently (2017). Modifications and modernizations to the system have continued. The Topol series is in service with the 35th Rocket Division stationed at Barnaul and this group maintains some 36 mobile launchers - though as many as 100 are thought to be on hand by Western observers.\n\r\nThe RT-2PM2 \"Topol-M\" is the latest incarnation of the mobile Topol system and is known to NATO as SS-27 \"Sickle B\".\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SS-25 / SS-27 / RT-2PM (Sickle / Topol)", "vehicle_type": "Mobile InterContinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Carrier"}, {"id": "e3b28ad0-3830-428c-9e19-4b49ef1ce2b4", "year_model": "2006", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9K720 \"Iskander\" was introduced to Russian Ground Forces in 2006 as a successor to the aging line of OTR-21\" Tochka\" mobile (self-propelled) short-ranged ballistic missile systems. The Tochka was a Soviet product of the Cold War years, introduced in 1976, and went on to see considerable service - particularly with Soviet-aligned Middle East customers. The Iskander family improves upon capabilities needed of short-ranged ballistic missiles on the modern battlefield and thus far it has been exported only to Armenia and Nigeria while having seen combat action in the ongoing Syrian Civil War (2011-Present).\n\r\nThe 9K720 Iskander is recognized by NATO forces as the SS-26 \"Stone\".\n\r\nThe weapon system is made up of two critical components: the missile itself and a large 8x8 wheeled transport vehicle. The transport vehicle has four well-spaced axles featuring oversized rubber roadwheels. The driving cab is set at the bow well ahead of the forward-most pair of wheels. The aft section of the truck is used to house the ballistic missile which rests horizontally when at rest and is erected vertically when the missile is readied for firing. A series of support arms are lowered about the chassis of the vehicle to stabilize the launch platform.\n\r\nThe missile is a single-stage, solid-propellant based weapon with an operational range out to ranges between 30 and 300+ miles and speeds hypersonically through the sky nearing Mach 6. The guidance unit is inertial-based, aided by GPS with terminal homing and accuracy is said to be within seven meters of the intended strike zone. The weapon weighs 8,400lb, has a length of 24feet, and a diameter of 3 feet. Its warhead can be variable, supporting the gamut of High-Explosive (HE), thermonuclear, sub-munition, Fuel-Air Explosive (FAE), and Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP) types.\n\r\nVariants include the \"Iskander-M\" which has been taken into service with the Russians and appears tobe the base production model. The \"Iskander-K\" supports the launching of cruise missile-type weapons of the Russian inventory for broader tactical value. The export version of the SS-26 is recognized as \"Iskander-E\" and features reduced complexity to help protect sensitive Russian technology and offers a range out to 280 kilometers.\n\r\nRussian forces maintain a stock of about 136 launchers to date (2018).

The T-34 began a long-running history of capable, cost-effective combat machines designed to match - or in some cases surpass - available Western offerings. The Cold War-era T-72 proved no exception, granted with excellent speed for its class and an inherent reliability that is always require by the modern battlefield. Perhaps most important to procurement authorities, the T-72 was a budget-conscious end-product which could be produced in the tens of thousands during a period when every effort was being made to stay one step ahead of the United States and Europe in comparable developments. As such, the T-72 has gone on to see an extended service life in many foreign inventories and has undoubtedly proven an export success. With over 25,000 examples delivered, the T-72 ranks only second to the most successful post-World War 2 tank - the T-54/T-55 (with as many as 100,000 being built). In comparison, the wartime T-34 saw 84,000 units produced.\n\r\nThe T-72 originated as a design to counter the expensive nature of the technologically-advanced T-64 of 1963. The T-64 was the primary spearhead Soviet Main Battle Tank and introduced the D-81T 125mm smoothbore main gun. To this point, Western offerings relied on a rifled 105mm system and have since gone on to adopt a 120mm smoothbore design themselves. The T-64 also coupled the 125mm main gun with an automatic loader which reduced the crew size to three and contained overall operational weights to manageable levels while promoting a reduced profile on the horizon. The T-64B was the first Soviet tank line to support firing guided anti-tank missiles from the main gun barrel which broadened its tactical value considerably. However, its procurement costs proved limited and only 13,000 T-64 tanks were produced from 1951 to 1962 from plants originating in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n\r\nThe prototype T-72 was born as the \"Object 172\" which evolved into the modified \"Object 172M\". Evaluations of this new vehicle were undertaken in 1971 and concluded the tank to be functional and capable, leading to its adoption as the \"T-72\" for the Red Army. Serial production began that same year, quickly replacing the T-55 and T-62 in production, and formal deliveries occurred the following. The T-72 was first unveiled to the public in the 1977 \"May Day\" parade and, amazingly, would retain its frontline status until the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991.\n\r\nExternally, the T-72 followed the tried-and-true doctrine of decades-long Soviet tank design. Much attention was always given to a very low profile from any angle and the addition of an autoloading mechanism lessened the turret crew to two personnel with the driver in the front-center of the hull (Western tanks generally utilize manual loading which required a fourth crewmember, a third person in the turret). The autoloading feature was devised as a carousel-type arrangement containing the charge in an upper rung and the projectile in a lower rung, brought together at the breech. The gunner could then respond to the commander's load and fire orders by electronically selecting the appropriate projectile and readying the main gun in this fashion. The commander's cupola was offset to the right of the turret roof and came complete with vision blocks. A integrated dozer blade was affixed to the underside of the bow to help plough tank obstacles or fill in anti-tank ditches with earth or sand.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-14 (Armata) (Object 148)", "vehicle_type": "Main Battle Tank (MBT)"}, {"id": "b11ac901-cbcf-4a36-86c1-3c2c9ebdd672", "year_model": "1958", "description": "\r\n        \tAfter the end of World War 2, the Soviet military had officially replaced their war-winning T-34 Medium Tank series with the T-54 family. These were then upgraded with NBC protection and a slew of other features to become the T-55 series a short time later, intended to counter the new, interim American developments. Going beyond simply upgrading the T-55, work also began on a new tank design based on the same proven T-54/T-55 system though intended to house a more powerful 115mm main gun. To fit the new armament, the base T-55 had her hull lengthened and given an all-new turret assembly designed specifically for a high-velocity smoothbore 115mm main gun - the U-5TS (2A20 \"Rapira\"). This weapon was of particular note for it marked the first time a production combat tank had been given a \"smoothbore\" barrel - to this point, all combat tanks fielded a rifled barrel, the Soviet direction proving a major upgrade to the 105mm rifled main gun being fielded by the new American M60.

As such, the type delivered roughly the same utilitarian appearance of its originator as well as the follow-up modification. The tank sported a low-profile design with a center-fitted turret emplacement. The glacis plate was very shallow and well-sloped for excellent point ballistics protection. The sides were dominated by the track system encompassing five road wheels to a hull side. The drive sprocket was held at the front with the track idler at the rear. Like the T-54 and T-55 before it, the T-62 lacked any track return rollers along the upper track region. The single diesel engine was held in a rear-set compartment and could generate its own smoke screen as needed. The turret was well-curved and squat in its general appearance, housing the 115mm U-5TS main gun armament as well as three of the four crew. The crew consisted of the driver in the front-left hull and the tank commander, gunner and loader in the turret/middle hull region. The turret was protected by up to 242mm of armor thickness along the front facing.  A pair of external fuel tanks could be fitted to the rear of the hull for improved ranges and jettisoned when empty. The main gun was fitted with a fume extractor and featured two-axis stabilization for adequate \"firing-on-the-move\". The main gun was also given case ejector actuated by the recoil action to which spent shell casings were ejected automatically out of the turret rear via a spring-loaded door after firing. The main gun was supplemented by a coaxial 7.62mm PKT series machine gun in the turret for anti-infantry defense. A 12.7mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun on the turret roof was optional and not generally seen in early production units. Up to 40 x 115mm projectiles were carried aboard, stored within the turret itself and primarily along the hull sides. 2,500 x 7.62mm rounds of machine gun ammunition were also carried for the coaxial machine gun. Power was derived from a V-55 12-cylinder diesel engine outputting at 580 horsepower. This supplied the vehicle with a top speed of 31 miles per hour on ideal surfaces with an operational range of 280 miles not including environmental factors.\n\r\nThe main gun was cleared to fire the requisite High-Explosive (HE) and Armor-Piercing (AP) projectiles of 115mm caliber. The HE breed consisted of the HE-FRAG-FS which stood for High-Explosive, Fragmentation, Fin-Stabilized. The HEAT-FS rounds was the High-Explosive, Anti-Tank, Fin-Stabilized variant. The AP round was the APFSDS - Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, Discarding Sabot. This projectile could range out at targets up to 1,100 yards away and penetrate up to 330mm of armor plate - a major upgrade from the projectile types fired from the 100mm main guns of the T-54 and T-55 series. The main gun held an elevation limitation of -6 to +16 degrees. One of the key limitations of the T-54/55 models were their lack of true \"hull down\" firing due to the main gun's depression restriction. The T-62 improved upon this limitation to an extent.\n\r\nThe T-62 was delivered with several notable standardized features including NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection for the crew as well as an automated fire extinguishing system which could also be manually actuated. An integrated snorkel could be erected prior to entering bodies of water and provide the T-62 with limited amphibious capabilities. The engine was used to generate a smoke screen, this essentially accomplished by injecting raw diesel into the engine for the desired result.

The type was a further evolution of the T-64 line with elements of the successful T-72 added for promising measure. The end result, the first production tank to utilize a gas turbine engine, proved a limited success with numbers never reaching those of its predecessor nor the overtly popular T-72. While still in active service today (2012), the days of the T-80 as a frontline battlefield solution are coming to an end as its available numbers are continually reduced with each passing year. The T-90 (based on the T-72) maintains the primary position in the modern Russian Army, leaving the T-80 as something of an interim solution at best,  a measure serving to bridge the gap between the expired Soviet-era T-64 and modern Russian Federation T-90.\n\r\nIn 1963, the Red Army began use of the T-64 Main Battle Tank which formed the spearhead of Soviet armor strength during the critical years of the Cold War. The T-64 incorporated an automatic loader coupled to a 125mm smoothbore main gun capable of firing guided anti-tank missiles. Its arrival certainly forced the West to take notice as it represented the most modern Red Army tank of the time. The T-72 was then developed in short order as a simpler, economical counterpart to the T-64, though it ended up surpassing the T-64 in both numbers and world popularity (some 25,000 T-72 tanks were produced to the 13,000 T-64s). Soviet tank doctrine called for both tank types to serve concurrently and allowed for financial flexibility in the long term. As the T-64 was considered something of a \"state secret\" in terms of its technology and capabilities, it was not openly exported as the T-72 was.\n\r\nAs such, the T-64 remained the principle high-tech Soviet Main Battle Tank to lead the Red Army onto victory in the event of total war across Europe. In the late 1960s, thought was already being given to a new design built upon the inherent strengths of the T-64. Many developmental tank designs had been in play since the close of World War 2 (1939-1945) for the Soviets and many of these went on to lay the foundation of Soviet tank technologies to come. Such developments began to refine a gas turbine engine that would one day be used in powering an armored vehicle though tank engineers would have to wait for technology to catch up with the desire.\n\r\nObject 288 was a tank testbed fitted with 2 x GTD-350 series aircraft turbine engines outputting at 690 horsepower. A second design, Object 219 SP1, utilized a single GTD-1000T multi-fuel gas turbine installation and this was able to output at 1,000 horsepower. After extensive testing of various chassis configurations, the Object 219 SP1 was modified into the refined Object 219 SP2 and it was this prototype that formed the basis of the \"T-80\". Design of the T-80 would span from 1967 until 1975 to which then serial production was ordered and the vehicle entered service in 1976 following the requisite army trials. Production of T-80s would last until 1992 to which 5,404 units would be delivered from LKZ and Omsk Transmash in Russia and Malyshev in the Ukraine. The gas turbine powerplant allowed for greater power over that of traditional diesel-fueled types at the expense of fuel consumption, general reliability and overall cost.\n\r\nIn keeping with Soviet tank design traditions, the T-80 managed a very low profile, exceptional inherent maneuverability and fielded a smoothbore main gun. The use of an autoloader in the turret reduced the traditional operating crew from four to three personnel to be made up of the driver (in the hull) and the commander and gunner (in the turret). The autoloader also allowed for a dimensionally shallower turret design and lighter overall weight. The tank's overall configuration was conventional with the engine at rear, the turret at center and the driver in front. The running gear of the T-80 consisted of six double-tired road wheels to a track side with the drive sprocket at the rear and the track idler at front. The upper track regions were protected over in side skirt armor. General armor protection is steel and composite which can be enhanced through add-on reactive armor blocks. Portions of the T-72's torsion bar suspension system was carried over into the T-80 which allowed for excellent inherent mobility for a vehicle of this weight class.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-80 (MBT)", "vehicle_type": "Main Battle Tank"}, {"id": "467f9019-f9ee-47fa-b4d2-192d0db39a0c", "year_model": "1995", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviets/Russians have always maintained a penchant for successful (and globally popular) tank designs since they unveiled their war-winning  T-34 Medium Tank during World War 2.

This helped to produce the TOS-1 (also \"TOC-1\") where the popular T-72 Main Battle Tank (MBT) chassis has formed the basis of a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). MLRSs are used as indirect fire weapons over range, often times attached to artillery regiments for massed firepower. Battlefield rockets have provided a tactical and psychological effect on enemy forces for generations and continues to do so today. Many modern armies stock special vehicles like MLRSs as a result.\n\r\nOmsk Transmash Design Bureau of the former Soviet Union headed design work on the vehicle in 1988. Obvious modifications to the existing T-72A model MBT included removal of its entire turret assembly, this structure accordingly replaced by a large and rectangular multi-shot rocket pack seated atop a traversing mount. The vehicle retained the original tank's crew of three and weighed 100,000 lb. Dimensions included a running length of 9.5 meters with a width of 3.6 meters and height of 2.22 meters. Power was through a standard V-84 diesel-fueled engine developing 840 horsepower. Performance specifications included a road speed of 37 miles per hour with an operational range out to 340 miles.\n\r\nThe multi-shot launcher pod was originally given 30 launch tubes in the TOS-1M variant. This was later reduced to 24 in the TOS-1A upgrade with sported a 3 x 8 tube arrangement. The rockets were of 220mm caliber and could carry variable warhead types to engage fortifications, light armored vehicles, and troops out in the open. The vehicle has been resupplied through a pair of accompanying TZM-T (KrAZ-255B) trucks which are modified especially for the rocket resupply role.\n\r\nPilot vehicles were evaluated operationally from 1988 into 1989 during the latter stages of the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) and found to be useful short-to-medium range assault weapons. Their development was kept rather \"close to the vest\" for it was not until 1999 that the vehicle was actually showcased to the public and seen in military parades since. Production had been from 1988 onwards and appears to continue today (2015).\n\r\nThe TOS-1 has managed to survive the post-Soviet defense budget crunch and is in operational service with the modern Russian Army which has allowed it to see additional combat actions as was the case during the Battle of Grozny (1999-2000) against Chechnya forces. A few foreign operators also exist, these being former Soviet satellite countries and Cold War-era customers - Azerbaijan, Iraq, and Kazakhstan - though none have operate the TOS-1 family in the numbers that the Russians field.\n\r\nDuring 2001, the Russian Army adopted a modernized and improved version of the original TOS-1M as the aforementioned TOS-1A. Changes to the base design included a reduction in the number of launch tubes used, installation of a new ballistics computer, and increased engagement ranges out to 3.7 miles. \n\r\nIraqi TOS-1 vehicles were used as recently as 2014 where their firepower was brought to bear on elements of ISIS during the assault on Jurf Al Sakhar in October. These were upgraded TOS-1A systems.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "TOS-1 (TOC-1)", "vehicle_type": "Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)"}, {"id": "28fdedbc-b9b8-4a5d-b54c-841a4acf3e3d", "year_model": "1978", "description": "\r\n        \tThe UR-77 \"Meterorit\" (\"Meteorite\") is a Soviet Cold War-era mine clearing / battlefield breaching vehicle. Design work was begun in 1977 and, utilizing the existing chassis of the 2A1 \"Gvozdika\" Self-propelled Artillery (SPA) chassis, the UR-77 was born. After its time in the Soviet Army, existing vehicles were taken over by the newly-established Russian Army forces. Beyond this, the vehicle has also been in operation service with the forces of Azerbaijan, Syria, and Ukraine and utilized in the First (1994-1996) and Second (1999-2000) Chechen wars, the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present), and the ongoing War in Donbas (the Russian Invasion of Ukraine; 2014-Present).\n\n\r\nBuilt atop the proven framework of the 2S1 SPA, the UR-77 shares the same track-and-wheel arrangement, powertrain, and powerpack. The running gear includes six small rubber-tired roadwheels to a hull side with the drive sprocket featured forward and the track idler aft.  The track link components run the entire length of the vehicle, are not supported by track-return rollers, and are not protected by armor skirts. The vehicle weighs 34,200lb (the 2S1 weighs around 35,300lb) and sits atop a torsion bar suspension system. A diesel engine of 300 horsepower provides drive power to the tank treads.\n\n\r\nAs the main armament of the 2S1 is removed in the UR-77, the standard operating crew is reduced from four to two (now just driver and commander) with the driver retaining his positioned at front-left in the hull. The same shallow glacis plate over the bow found on the 2S1 series enhances ballistics protection and the lack of a true traversing turret means that the reimagined vehicle has an even lower battlefield profile. The powerpack is contained to the front-right in the hull, allowing the rear of the hull to seat the line-breaching equipment.\n\r\nOver the rear of the hull is seated the launcher unit which raises up on a powered hinge for arced fire. Rocket-powered mine-clearing line charges are housed within a pair of launch tubes, firing out from the muzzle with the backblast being contained rear of the vehicle. Effective range of the weapon is approximately 300 feet. Upon hitting its mark, the line charge disrupts any armed, awaiting mine (even buried dangers), causing them to detonat. This destructive value is not lost on ground commanders either for the vehicle has been used to demolish standing structures that can house enemy elements.\n\r\nDespite its Cold War roots, the UR-77 continues to serve an active role in the modern Russian Army.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "UR-77 (Meterorit)", "vehicle_type": "Mine Clearing Vehicle"}, {"id": "88642d8e-18ac-437a-81dd-58bf4cacc14b", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tThe wars of the late 1990s and 2000s gave rise to a whole new class of armored vehicle called Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) providing frontline ground forces with enhanced protection in urban settings. The MRAP was used to good effect throughout the American and coalition wars in Afghanistan and Iraq where surprise attacks from mines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and guerilla-style assaults proved commonplace. A long-time fixture of South African forces, the MRAP eventually became a mainstay of major fighting forces such as the United States, Great Britain, and Russia.\n\r\nOne of the available Russian forces is the KAMAZ-53949 - also known as the Taifun K-53949 - born of the versatile \"Typhoon\" line of vehicles manufactured en mass by the KamAZ concern of Russia. The general form entered serial production in 2014 and has branched to include various types in 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 wheeled configurations. The K-53949 is a 4x4 wheeled form serving as both an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) of sorts and an armored cargo vehicle.\n\r\nMRAPs get their classification from the ability to sustain extensive damage or showcase enhanced resilience from blasts that would otherwise destroy or debilitate a traditional light-armored wheeled vehicle. A typical design quality of such vehicles is a Vee-shaped undercarriage used to deflect blasts away from the vehicle and its occupants. In addition to this, blast-resistant seats are usually part of the design makeup, increasing the likelihood of passenger survival in active warzones. Other notable qualities include blast/bullet resistant walls and windows, gun ports, and multiple entry-exit hatches/doors.\n\r\nThe K-53949 utilizes a conventional automobile-style layout with the engine at front and crew/passenger cabin middle-aft. Large road tires are featured with a run-flat ability and the vehicle is given high ground clearance. Armor protection is against small arms fire and artillery spray. An amphibious quality is granted by way of a ducted, raised exhaust stack originating from the right side of the engine compartment. The rear of the vehicle can be configured for various battlefield roles including cargo-hauling, Command Post (CP), Anti-Tank Guided-Missile (ATGM) missile carrier, and battlefield ambulance (known as the \"Linza\"). Armament (including Remote Weapon Stations - RWSs) is variable and seated atop the roof of the vehicle for complete 360-degree traversal of the weapon emplacement. Also, any personal weapons carried by the occupants can come into play as needed.\n\r\nInterestingly, there is heavy reliance on Western components in the general makeup of the Russian-borne Taifun. This includes the Cummins 6ISBe 350 series P-6 diesel-fueled engine which powers the 4x4 wheeled arrangement and coupled to an Allison 6-speed automatic transmission system. The engine propels the vehicle to road speeds of 105 kmh out to a range not exceeding 850 kilometers. The hull is developed by Israel-based Plasan Sasa.\n\r\nThe vehicle measures an overall length of 6.4 meters, a beam of 2.5 meters, and a height of 3.3 meters - giving proper clearance for air transportation in the hold of both tactical- and strategic-type airlifters. Two crew are typically featured with seating for an additional eight personnel. Entry-exit is through four automobile-style hinged doors and a rear access point. The vehicle can ford water sources of 1.75 meters deep (some preparation is required) and cross 0.5 meter trenches. Its gradient traverse limited is 60%. The vehicle sits atop a Timoney (of Ireland) hydropneumatic suspension system which aids in cross-country travel.\n\r\nThis Typhoon entry was developed as a private venture in 2010 and unveiled in 2013.

Unlike the ZiL-131, the ZiL-157 was only utilized by the Soviets, China, Vietnam, and North Korea but has, itself, been formally succeeded by the more modern ZiL-4334 series trucks in Russian service.\n\r\nDimensions of the base vehicle include an overall length of 7.04 meters, a width of 2.5 meters, and a height of 2.5 meters. Curb weight is 6,700 kilograms. Its payload can reach up to 5,000kg for in-road traveling (less so when going off road).\n\r\nKey qualities of the truck are its large road wheels and high ground clearance, allowing it to traverse cross-country and water sources. The suspension system includes solid axles coupled to leaf springs. Power is from a ZiL-130 6.0L V8 diesel engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission system with 2-speed transfer case. A pair of 45-gallon gasoline tanks fuel the engine.\n\r\nThe versatility of the ZiL-131 is key to its success, having been the host vehicle for a variety of field solutions including the BN-21 \"Grad\" Multiple Launch, Rocket Projector (MLRS) vehicles (detailed elsewhere on this site) relied heavily on by the Soviet / Russian army. Beyond this, variants that have appeared include models utilized by border guard elements, specialized fire trucks, MEDEVAC, SCUD missile carriers, general transport (open flatbed or soft/hard covered), dedicated Command Posts (CPs), fuel tankers, and even mobile field bakeries.\n\r\nOperators of the ZiL-131 currently (2022) include many former Soviet allies and supported states - notable entries being Georgia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Syria, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Former operators are Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Iraq, and Yugoslavia.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "ZiL-131", "vehicle_type": "6x6 Wheeled Military Truck"}, {"id": "f52f78eb-b9a7-40a7-a612-85b510e2dcc4", "year_model": "1965", "description": "\r\n        \tThe ZSU-23-4 \"Shilka\" system has been - and in many examples continues to be - a much-feared anti-aircraft system for pilots of low-flying aircraft all over the world. The effectiveness of the Shilka at low altitudes is a well documented story as the system has seen considerable action in several major global conflicts. The Shilka was initially reserved mainly for the Soviet Army and her (now former) supported states during the Cold War and went on to be exported heavily to ally nations in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. The Shilka defense system continues to serve in some impressive quantities with several armies around the world despite her 1960s-era origins. At the time of her inception, no anti-aircraft gunnery platform in the NATO inventory could match the lethality that was the ZSU-23-4 Shilka series.\n\r\nThe Shilka came about through a need by the Soviet Army to upgrade its existing self-propelled anti-aircraft gun capabilities. Her primary adversaries of the time were the United States and Great Britain and both were fully capable of fielding top-of-the-line ground attack aircraft including helicopters that would - in the event of all-out war in Europe - be called to limit the usefulness of Soviet armor. At the time, the primary system available to the Red Army was the ZSU-57-2 tracked series mounting a powerful set of 57mm cannons. However, despite this large-caliber armament, the system was inherently limited by its optically aimed tracking system, lack of integrated radar with no provision for engaging targets while \"on the move\". Onboard ammunition storage capability was also limited to just 300 rounds of 52mm projectiles.\n\r\nDevelopment on a replacement began in 1957 and continued into 1962. The new design - to become the ZSU-23-4 (otherwise known as the \"Shilka\" after the Shilka River found in Eastern Russia)  - incorporated the tracked chassis of the GM-575 with a flat, rounded turret system mounting 4 x 23mm rapid fire autocannons. A water-cooling system was fitted to keep the guns from overheating and at least 2,000 of 23mm ammunition could be carried aboard. A radar system (the RPK-2 \"Tobol\") was installed to aid the crew in the tracking and engagement of targets along the rear of the turret roof. The vehicle would be crewed by four personnel made up of a driver, commander, gunner and radar operator with the driver located at the forward portion of the hull and the rest of the crew in the turret. The turret was set at the middle of the hull roof with the engine mounted in a rear compartment. The vehicle utilized six rubber-tired road wheels with a long running set of tracks which gave good cross-country mobility in keeping up with Soviet armored formations. This effectively allowed  the weapon to be stationed just about anywhere a tank or similar wheeled vehicle could. The turret allowed for a full 360-degree traversal with extensive elevation that would let the crew engage both low-flying aerial targets as well as ground-based ones. Aerial targets could be engaged at 2.5 miles out while land-based ones at 1.5 miles. The radar itself could pick up targets as far out as 12 miles allowing the crew to be prepared to greet. Armor protection for the crew ranged from over 9mm on the turret to 15mm on the hull. Power was supplied from a V-6R series 6-cylinder, 4-stroke airless-injection water-cooled diesel engine developing 280 horsepower that allowed for speeds up to 50km/h on roads with a range out to 450km. The hull was seated on an individual torsion bar suspensions system with hydraulic shock absorbers fitted to several of the wheel pairings. Production by Mytishchi Engineering Works began in 1964 and continued on to 1982 to which some 6,500 examples were produced all. The ZSU-23-4 formally entered service in 1965 and over 38% of the production total went to serve in 23 countries around the globe.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "ZSU-23-4 (Shilka)", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun (SPAAG)"}], "aircraft": [{"id": "813ec004-4ace-4c8b-9a46-3e4cf158aa43", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Aero L-39 series of advanced jet trainer and light strike aircraft followed along the same lines as its predecessor - the L-29 \"Delphin\" detailed elsewhere on this site - in terms of development. Designed just three years after the successful L-29 became the frontline advanced trainer for the Soviet Union and associated Bloc countries, the L-39 emerged in prototype form and recorded its first flight on November 4th, 1968 prior to introduction with the Czechoslovakian Air Force in 1972. From then on, the aircraft was equally accepted and successful in the training of a new generation of pilots for the Soviet Empire and its satellite states and supporters. Total production exceeding 3,000 aircraft from 1971 to 1999. It became the first turbofan-powered trainer to enter serial production.\n\r\nCompared to the earlier L-29, the L-39 was a more simplified approach with modularity in mind, allowing the newer aircraft to be produced more efficiently and quicker than its counterpart. The powerplant increased thrust was added as was a new avionics suite along with a reinforced structure. The tandem, twin-seat aircraft - as in the L-29 before it - allowed for unfettered views out of the cockpit (save for the rear), bringing about a heightened sense of situational awareness. The training derivative was eventually branched into a light strike form and four underwing hardpoints were used to carry various ordnance options including rocket pods, air-to-air missiles, and conventional drop bombs. This was in addition to the standard, centerline-mounted 23mm GSh-23L twin-barrel cannon for close-in work.\n\r\nOutwardly, the L-39 was a complete revision over the L-29. It sported low-set, straight-edged,  monoplane mainplanes with a well-sloped nose assembly. Views were hindered by the raised fuselage spine but this, in turn, allowed for increased internal storage space. Twin, half-moon intakes were set to either side of the slim fuselage which aspirated the single turbofan engine installation. The tail unit included a single vertical tail fin and low-mounted horizontal planes as well as the singular jetpipe. The tricycle undercarriage consisted of a single-wheeled nose leg and two single-wheeled main legs under the wings.\n\r\nExport numbers for the L-39 Albatross were abundant was the case with the L-29 - though roughly the same set of customers greeted the new machine. Thailand went on to purchase forty of an export model designated with L-39ZA/ART that featured Israeli-produced Elbit avionics. The most numerous in terms of production was the L-39C model which helped drive total production of the L-39 system as a whole past the 3,000 mark.\n\r\nVariants have included the five prototypes and two static airframes as the L-39X (-01 through -07). The L-39C was the standard trainer for many Soviet entities during the Cold War. The L-39CM became an upgraded C-form for the Slovakian Air Force. The Ukrainians received the L-39M1 with AI-25TLSh series turbofan engines. The L-39V variant covered target tugs for the Czechoslovakian Air Force. A weapons trainer emerged as the L-39ZO. An armed trainer and light attack platform became the L-39ZA which supported air-to-air missile launching. The L-39ZAM was a Slovakian Air Force modernization of the L-39ZA mark.\n\r\nThe L-39 was then offered in a more refined form through the L-59 \"Super Albatros\" and the line further branched to include the L-159 \"Alca\". However, these did not go on to achieve the same level of success as the L-39, leaving Aero Vodochody to now offer an all-new, modernized version of the L-39 instead as the L-39NG (\"Next Generation\"). This was announced in August of 2014 with intended upgrades aimed at the avionics suite and engines (the U.S.-built Williams FJ44 series). The aircraft would serve the current military market as a low-cost advanced jet trainer alternative to more pricier mounts emerging from the West and Russia. The prototype is expected to go airborne sometime in 2016 with the product becoming available in 2018.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Aero L-39 Albatros", "aircraft_type": "Advanced Jet Trainer / Light Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "3d78373b-f316-4798-80fd-e78545bee35d", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tLong-time helicopter-maker Kamov of Russia produces the all-modern Ka-226 co-axial rotor light-utility helicopter that has since seen formal adoption by the militaries of Russia and India. The platform utilizes the Kamov signature co-axial main rotor arrangement, in which one multi-bladed main rotor is set atop another, which negates use of an anti-torque tail rotor unit. The rotors themselves carry an advanced blade design critical to efficiency and effectiveness. Under 100 units of this versatile helicopter have been completed to date (2018) with foreign market interest slowly growing.\n\r\nThe Ka-226 can trace its lineage to the earlier single-engined Ka-126 (17 built) of 1989 which, itself, was born from the much-earlier Cold War-era Ka-26 (816 built) of 1969. Work on the Ka-226 was begun around 1990 and intended to satisfy a Russian government need for a multi-role humanitarian relief platform.\n\r\nOn the whole, the Ka-226 shares a conventional design arrangement which sees the cockpit overlooking a short nose section, a centralized engine and passenger cabin, and a tail unit at the rear. The forward section of the aircraft relies on oversized panes for excellent vision out-of-the-cockpit. The flight crew enter/exit through hinged automobile-style doors along the forward fuselage sides. Aft of the cockpit (which sports side-by-side seating for the two pilots) is the multi-faceted cabin area.\n\r\nUnlike other similar light utility-minded helicopter types, Kamov engineers have fashioned a truly multi-role platform with their Ka-226 design for the entire cabin section is a module that can be readily replaced for different mission roles. This versatility allows the helicopter to undertake sorties ranging from general equipment/passenger transport, VIP service, and security to MEDEVAC, fire-fighting, and emergency relief.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Airbus Helicopters AS350 Ecureuil/Astar", "aircraft_type": "Light Utility Helicopter (LUH)"}, {"id": "f34c57b9-fdb8-4363-b07b-8dea0825a89c", "year_model": "1959", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-12 (NATO codename of \"Cub\") was the primary medium-lift military transport of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and allies during the Cold War decades. It operated in similar form and function to the American Lockheed C-130 Hercules which proved exceedingly popular in the West. The An-12 held a direct origin to the An-8, a twin-engine, high-winged light military transport adopted by the Soviet Air Force as well as the civilian passenger airliner concern of Aeroflot. The An-10 was then born of the An-8 to become a four-engined passenger hauler with lengthened fuselage for Aeroflot and, from this, was delivered the military-minded An-12 - retaining the former's four-engine design and high-mounted wings while introducing a rear cargo access ramp akin to the preceding An-8 design.\n\r\nWith more land area to defend than any other superpower of the time, the Soviet military was faced with the daunting prospect of finding ways to mobilize and transport large amounts of men, equipment and weapons to hotspots wherever they may arise. As such, the nation went through an extended period of developing medium and heavy freighters (which continued to this day) to help fill this important logistical role.\n\r\nThe An-12 was designed by Russian Oleg Antonov whose bureau shares his name. First flight of an An-12 prototype was on December 16th, 1957 and powered through 4 x Kuznetsov NK-4 turboprop engines. This same prototype was then severely damaged on a landing approach in 1958, perhaps serving as a symbol of the aircraft's troubled existence still to be realized. Further testing finally cleared the type for military service as the An-12BP and these were outfitted with 4 x Ivchenko AI-20 series turboprop engines. Production of the type spanned from 1957 into 1973 to which 1,248 were produced under various configurations and designations.\n\r\nThe value of such platforms as the An-12 lay in their short runway capabilities and hauling qualities. This was aided, in part, by the high-mounted wings and four engine installations. The high-mounted wing allowed for strong lifting qualities while also clearing the spinning propeller blades from ground personnel moving around the outside of the aircraft. The raised tail unit also allowed unrestricted access to the cargo hold by way of a powered door and loading ramp. With the cockpit set well-forward in the design, the fuselage could largely serve to manage cargo as well as fuel stores and other mission-pertinent components. While traditionally unarmed, some Zn-12 variants featured a 2 x 23mm NR-23 cannon installation at the tail to counter perusing aircraft - a common practice seen in many large aircraft of the Cold War period. A typical crew numbered five personnel to include a pair of pilots, a flight engineer, a navigator and a radioman.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-12 (Cub)", "aircraft_type": "Military Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "1245260f-abf6-47bb-b4d6-065e38c5d7cf", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-124 (NATO codename of \"Condor\") was the world's largest aircraft before the Antonov An-225 made its debut. The An-124 was developed specifically as a replacement for the aging An-22 with a military mission scope similar to the American Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, sharing a similar configuration.\n\r\nThe An-124 utilizes both nose and cargo doors for simultaneous loading and unloading and can move tons of supplies and equipment at the strategic theater level. Her listed empty eight is 175,000 kilograms which is superseded by a maximum take-off weight of 405,000 kilograms showcasing  type's hauling capabilities. Power is served through 4 x Ivchenko Progress D-18T series turbofan engines developing 51,600lbs of thrust each. The engine configuration allows for a top speed of 540 miles per hour, a cruise speed of 500 miles per hour, a range out to 3,300 miles with a service ceiling of nearly 40,000 feet (39,400 listed, all factors of course load-dependent).\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the An-124 is highly conventional with a wide, deep fuselage assembly capped by a high-mounted flight deck at the front and an elevated tail unit at the rear. The tail is finished with a single vertical tail fin and low-mounted horizontal planes. The elevated nature of the appendage allows for rear cargo access through proper structural clearance. This requires a strong support structure at the center of the design and the An-124 does not disappoint with 24 wheels managed by two main undercarriage positions under the main section of the fuselage. The nose is supported by a two-wheeled leg in turn. \n\r\nAs with other aircraft of this type, the An-124 makes use of shoulder-mounted wing assemblies offering excellent ground clearance. Each wing sports noticeable sweep along their leading and trailing edges, offering the required handling at low-speeds. Each wing also manages a pair of underwing engine nacelles which provide the necessary thrust for the platform.\n\r\nAs of this writing (2013), many An-124s actually sport civilian markings for they make exceptional material-hauling transports. Libya owns a pair of An-124s while Ukraine operates some seven units. The UAE manages a single example. Russian firms Aeroflot, Ayaks, Russian State Transport Company and Transaero Airlines each operate the type. The Russian Air Force remains the only military operator of the An-124 with 25 examples across the 12th Military Transport Air Division and the 224th Air Detachment of Military Transport Aviation. The United Kingdom was a former limited civilian operator of the type when several concerns - Air Foyle, HeavyLift Cargo Airlines, Antonov AirTrack, Titan Cargo and TransCharter Titan Cargo - made use of the series. All have since been dissolved or have gone out of operations involving An-124s.\n\r\nOver 50 examples have been produces since service introduction occurred in 1986. The series has existed in several notable variant forms including the base An-124 transport. The An-124-100 is a commercial cargo hauler while the similar An-124-100M-150 is outfitted with Western-minded avionics equipment.  The An-124-102 is another commercial variant. The An-124-130 existed as a proposed variant that fell to naught. The An-124-135 proved another air freighter variant. The An-124-150 remains a proposed upgraded mount as does the An-124-200, the latter intended to be powered by American General electric CF6-80C2 series turbofan engines of 60,000lbs thrust each. The An-124-300 is the most modern and technologically advanced offering of the An-124 family, having entered service in number with the Russian Air Force.\n\r\nIt was reported in January of 2013 that a new initiative by Volga-Dnepr Group of Russia is pushing for a restart of An-124 production.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-124 Ruslan (Condor)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Heavy-Lift Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "ab4aa86f-a95f-4bd3-bae4-ecbff3217322", "year_model": "2002", "description": "\r\n        \tModest turboprop-powered aircraft still have a place in the regional passenger hauler and cargo transport markets of the world.

A first-flight, by way of prototype, was had on September 17th, 1997 and service introduction followed in 2002. Only about twenty aircraft are in active service (January 2017) with nearly that amount on order.

The aircraft sports an overall length of 74.1 feet, a wingspan of 80.4 feet and a height of 27 feet. Empty weight is 28,240lb against an MTOW of 47,350lb. Power is from 2 x Klimov TV3-117VMA-SBM1 turboprop engines developing 2,466 horsepower each though an alternative fit is offered, one that is designed to make the An-140 a \"friendlier\" international player, by way of 2 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127A series turboprops of 2,500 horsepower (each).\n\r\nStated performance includes a maximum speed of 357 miles per hour, a cruise speed of 290 mph, a range out to 1,505 miles (ferry range of 2,300 miles) and a service ceiling of 25,000 feet. Rate-of-climb is listed at 1,345 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nNotable variants of the line are the An-140T tactical airlifter (designed for the rigors of military service), the An-140TK (a convertible passenger-or-cargo form), the An-140VIP (30 passengers), the An-140-100 (increased wingspan, multirole use), and the HESA IrAn-140.

This allows for the considerably large turbofan engines - one to a wing - to be underslung beneath each wing and held ahead of the leading edge while using a low-profile undercarriage. The cockpit sits aft of a pointed, short nose cone which provides good visibility from the cockpit of the surrounding airspace. The fuselage is expectedly tubular on the whole while being tapered at the rear to which a T-style tail assembly is featured. Rectangular doors along the fuselage sides allow for passenger entry/exit and the fuselage sides (complete with integrated staircases) are also dotted with vision ports. The undercarriage is wholly-retractable and consists of two double-tired main landing gear legs and a double-tired nose leg, the latter under the cockpit floor. The An-148 promotes a low ground clearance when at rest to which the engine nacelles are served well by the high-mounted wings. The cockpit takes a largely digital approach featuring five color displays and dual controls. Power is served through 2 x Progress D-436 turbofan engines developing 15,060lbs of thrust. Based on published numbers, cruising speeds reach approximately 500 miles per hour depending on variant.

A two-class internal arrangement seats a useful 68 passengers. The An-148-100Bc is a longer-range variant which increases operations out to 2,200 miles (from the 1,300 miles showcased through the base An-148-100A). The An-148-100E is another long-range model with an increased Maximum Take-Off Weight and can reach out to 2,700 miles.

The fuselage was tubular though squat, creating the wide-body internal volume required in the transport role. Bulges along the lower fuselage sides housed an array of landing wheels to coincide with the nose gear (also designed with rough-field operations in mind).

The undercarriage is a conventional retractable tricycle configuration with the twin-wheeled main legs recessing into the engine nacelles and the twin-wheeled nose leg retracting under the cockpit floor.\n\r\nThe An-24 differed from earlier Antonov company products in that it was designed and built to stricter military requirements centered on battlefield conditions - in particular operations from makeshift runways / rough fields. Besides being utilized as a military transport, the series was also handed various other roles that included humanitarian assistance, general cargo transportation, and VIP passenger hauling (up to 52 personnel in this role). Other forms were relied upon for the atmospheric reconnaissance role and still others were used to test various engine fits and other technologies in an active airborne setting - such was the aircraft's versatility.\n\r\nAs can be expected, the An-24 was evolved into many variants. \"An-24\" was used to mark the first prototypes. The An-24AT-RD was a transport with turbojet-boosting take-off capabilities. The An-24B seated 50 passengers and used single-slotted flaps while the An-24D was a planned but abandoned long-range passenger hauler. A pair of An-24LR models carried Sideways-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) for ice reconnaissance sorties. The An-24PS was used in the Search and Rescue (SAR) role while the An-24RT became a communications relay platform.\n\r\nThe related An-26 is a tactical transport complete with cargo ramp. The An-30 is used in the photographic-mapping role and carries specialized equipment. The An-32 is the An-26 developed for better handling of extreme weather conditions. The An-34 is the unused designation for the eventual An-24T mark. The An-50 became an abandoned jet-powered project involving the An-24 design fitted with 4 x Ivchenko AI-25 turbofan engines - it was not furthered.\n\r\nThe An-24V production mark was crewed by three and could ferry up to 50 passengers. Overall length reached 77.1 feet with a wingspan of 95.9 feet, and a height of 27.3 feet. Empty weight was 30,000lb against an MTOW of 46,300lb. Power was from 2 x Ivchenko AI-24A turboprop engines developing 2,550 horsepower each driving 4-bladed AV-72 series constant-speed propellers measuring 12.9 feet in diameter.\n\r\nThe aircraft could hope to reach speeds of 280 miles-per-hour out to a range of 1,500 miles (with full payload capacity reached) and its service ceiling topped at 27,600 feet. Rate-of-climb reached 375 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nCurrent (2020) military operators of the An-24 include the North Korean Air Force (one example modified to serve in the Airborne Early Warning - AEW - role), the Russian Air Force and Navy, and the Ukrainian Air Force and Navy. Post operators include Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Iran, Iraq, Poland, Vietnam and others. Civilian market forms are also in use or have existed in the past.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-24 (Coke)", "aircraft_type": "Twin-Turboprop Military Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "628a5203-5a91-4b7d-a261-8ca9b71fd725", "year_model": "1969", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-26 was developed from the An-24 of 1962 for the airliner passenger / general transport role. First flight of the An-26 product was on May 21st, 1969 and production spanned from then until 1986 to which 1,403 examples were ultimately realized. A plethora of variants then emerged and operators have ranged the globe with many airframes still in active service today (2014).\n\r\nThe original An-24 proved a design that was robust for the most harshest of conditions available across the vast Soviet empire - particularly in hard to reach areas of the frontier where few services were available. This propelled a new, modified form to gain traction, one in particular that included a powered loading ramp for ease of moving cargo pallets to and from the aircraft to awaiting bays or transport trucks. With a new ramp design finishing its testing phase, the installation commenced to produce the new working designation of An-26.\n\r\nAs finalized, the An-26 carried over much of the same form and function of the preceding An-24 model including its high-wing design and twin engine layout. The tail unit remained a single vertical fin with low-set horizontal planes. The flight deck was held at the extreme front end of the fuselage aft of a short nose cone. The cargo hold then made up a bulk of the available internal space remaining. Initial production models were recognized simply as \"An-26\" and were identified in NATO nomenclature as \"Curl-A\". A combo passenger/cargo-hauler form then became the An-26-100. The local Chinese variant became the Xian Y-7H military transport.\n\r\nOther limited production variants followed including an Arctic reconnaissance platform with special mission equipment, an atmospheric air lab, an assault transport prototype, various testbeds, a fire-fighting platform, and other proposed (some unrealized) designs.\n\r\nOperators have gone on to range from Angola and Belarus to Yemen and Zambia. Many military operators have since abandoned the type including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Poland, and Somalia. The United States operated An-26s through the 6th Special Operations Squadron of the United States Air Force from the period of 2003 to 2007. Soviet An-26s were passed on to the emerging states after the fall of the Soviet empire.

The design was based on the framework established by the earlier Antonov An-24 airliner of 1962. A first-flight, by way of prototype, was had on August 21st, 1967 and service introduction began in July 1968. From the period of 1971 to 1980, some 123 were built covering both civilian and military operators from Bulgaria and China to the Soviet Union and Vietnam.\n\r\nThe An-30 was known to NATO under the codename of \"Clank\".\n\r\nDesign-wise the An-30 retained much of the form and function of the An-24 that it was originated from. The nose section was obviously reworked for the new role but the aircraft carried a high-wing mainplane arrangement, each seating a turboprop engine at the leading edges. The fuselage was tubular and tapered noticeably at the rear to which a single vertical fin was mounted with low-set horizontal stabilizers. The undercarriage was of a tricycle arrangement and fully-retractable.\n\r\nAs built, the An-30 featured a crew of seven and a length of 79.6 feet, a wingspan of 95.9 feet and a height of 27.2 feet. Empty weight was 34,400 lb against an MTOW of 50,705lb. Power was from 2 x ZMKB Progress AI-24T turboprop engines developing 2,803 horsepower each. Maximum speed reached 335 miles per hour with a cruising speed of 265mph. Range was out to 1,635 miles and the aircraft's service ceiling was 27,230 feet.\n\r\nThe An-24FK served as the only prototype of the An-30's development and this was based on the existing An-24B with a slightly elevated flight deck and navigator's position in the glazed-over nose section. The An-30A was the first in-service production form and introduced into the civilian market through the Ministry of Civil Aviation (Soviet). Some of the stock was also sold off to export customers. The An-30B was the follow-up, militarized model for service in the Soviet Air Force and differed in its avionics suite. Later versions also had countermeasures kits fitted.\n\r\nThe An-30D \"Sibiryak\" was a long-range development of the An-30A production model. The aircraft were given increased range through larger fuel stores and were equipped with more modern and mission-specific systems. These served in the civilian market.\n\r\nThe An-30FG was a one-off Czech Air Force An-30 which carried Western radar. The An-30M \"Meteozashchita\" was a weather research platform. The An-30R became an NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) reconnaissance platform for Soviet Air Force service. This mark served handily in the Chernobyl crisis of 1986.\n\r\nThe An-30 series serves in a limited capacity today (2017) with civil operator Aero-Fret in the Congo and Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and Ukraine being the only known military operators.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-30 (Clank)", "aircraft_type": "Transport / Reconnaissance Aircraft"}, {"id": "40492e61-11c3-468b-911c-e4cac6f15c9c", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tBecause of the sheer size of the Soviet military during the Cold War era (1947-1991), its various services required various transport types to move man, machines and supplies about. The Antonov An-72 (NATO codename of \"Coaler\") became a product of the period, intended for the logistically-minded tactical transport role. The rather unique aircraft incorporated turbofan engines over the shoulder-mounted wings which made for maximum clearance of the jet wash and promoted excellent inherent lifting properties. The An-72 was eventually adopted as a successor to the aging Antonov An-26 \"Curl\" transport family (detailed elsewhere on this site) and would go on to see service with various Soviet states and allied nations around the globe.\n\r\nFirst flying in December of 1977 (in prototype form of which two would be built), actual production models were not available until the mid-1980s and, even then, these were highly-modified from their original presented forms. The An-72 was designed with Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) in mind so robustness and reliability were key qualities but an natural capability became excellent maneuverability despite the size of the aircraft. The high-mounted engines were purposefully placed so the engine exhaust could feed over trailing edge wing devices, effectively increasing low-level performance.\n\r\nThe An-72 (\"Coaler-A\") platform went on to spawn other variants that included the maritime surveillance-minded An-72P (Patrol), the An-71 \"Madcap\" AEW (Airborne Early Warning) aircraft and the An-74 \"Improved Coaler\", the latter with upgraded engines and a more traditional/conventional engine mounting. The An-72P was developed in conjunction with Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) and featured a revised \"glass\" cockpit, specialized Elta-brand radar, and an Electronic Warfare (EW) fit as well as long-range day-or-night observation equipment and related systems/subsystems. It also held provision for rocket and bombs and was armed through a single 23mm GSh-23L series autocannon. The An-72AT was a dedicated transport developed to accommodate foreign shipping containers. The An-72S became a VIP transport and could be used in the MEDEVAC role when configured as such.\n\r\nAbout 195 of the series were built under the An-72 and An-74 guises and production has spanning from 1977 to the present. The An-74 was developed (and produced in parallel to the An-72) along the lines of cold weather support and operated through a crew of five, added more fuel storage and installed a larger radar. It was introduced in 1983.\n\r\nAnother notable offshoot, the An-71, emerged in 1985 through a first-flight on July 12th. Only three prototypes of this mark were produced and the variant's program was ultimately cancelled. The version was intended for the Tactical AWACS (Airborne Early Warning And Control = AEW&C) role and carried a dish installation over the rear fuselage.\n\r\nCurrent (2017) military operators of the Coaler family line include Equatorial Guinea, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. The type also sees service in the civilian sector with various operators worldwide. Several have already given up on the series for more modern designs.\n\r\nAs designed, the An-72 featured a length of 92 feet, a wingspan of 104.7 feet and a height of 28.4 feet. Empty weight was 42,000lb against an MTOW of 76,060lb. Power was served from 2 x Lotarev D-36 1A turbofan engines developing upwards of 14,330lb of thrust (each) and maximum speed reached 435 miles-per-hour with a cruising speed of around 375 mph. Range was listed out to 2,690 miles.\n\r\nThe An-72/An-74 series eventually took on the nickname of \"Cheburashka\", a Soviet cartoon character, owing to its large over-wing engines resembling the character's large ears.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-72 / An-74 (Coaler)", "aircraft_type": "Tactical Medium Military Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "5a1630da-5362-4778-9f29-96ea51dac268", "year_model": "1984", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Beriev A-50 (NATO codename: 'Mainstay') serves the modern Russian Air Force in the Airborne and Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) role - commonly recognized in U.S. speak as 'AWACS'. The framework is that of the Soviet Ilyushin IL-76 'Candid' transport aircraft of the Cold War period with modifications completed by the Beriev concern to produce a new aircraft for the AWACS role. The most distinguishing feature of the A-50 series is its radome which sits over the rear dorsal section of the fuselage. Service introduction of the aircraft occurred in 1984 and production spanned from 1978 to 1992 to which some forty examples were completed. The A-50 remains in active service (though in modernized forms) with the Russian Air Force as well as the Indian Air Force - the only two global operators of the type.\n\r\nThe A-50 was developed as a successor to the aging Tupolev Tu-126 ('Moss') aircraft line which first appeared in 1962 (service entry followed in 1965). The Tu-126 was converted from the Tu-114 commercial airliner and became the Soviet Union's first AEW platform. In 1971, a prototype Ilyushin IL-76 recorded its first-flight and saw introduction in 1974 with nearly 1,000 units made over the life of its production run. This aircraft proved a multirole performer for the Soviet Empire and thus was selected by authorities for conversion to the AWACS role in the late 1960s with work continuing into the early-to-mid 1980s.\n\r\nA first-flight of an A-50 prototype was had on December 19th, 1978 and twenty-four examples were delivered for service in 1984.\n\r\nBeyond the obvious external structural additions, the internal landscape of the transport was reworked to take on crew stations with the total crew complement numbering fifteen. The 'Liana' surveillance radar system was fitted as a suspended saucer-like structure over the rear of the fuselage and this powerful system allowed for target tracking out to 650 kilometers for aerial threats (300 km otherwise). The radar was to assist in both intercept and ground-attack missions as well as provide valuable battlefield surveillance and air traffic control.\n\r\nThe aircraft sports dimensions that include a length of 152.7 feet, a wingspan of 165.5 feet and a height of 48.4 feet. Empty weight is 165,400lb against an MTOW of 365,000lb. Power is from 4 x Soloviev D-30KP turbofan engines developing 26,500lb of thrust each, providing speeds nearing 560 miles per hour and ranges out to 4,000 miles (a built-in air refueling capability is seen in modernized forms for extended operational ranges). The aircraft's service ceiling is approximately 40,000 feet.\n\r\nWhile A-50 marks the standard initial production forms, several modernized variants have emerged since including the A-50M and A-50U. The M-model adds the aforementioned in-flight refueling capability and the U-model of 1995 features extensive updates to its equipment (primarily the Vega-M radar fit, giving simultaneous tracking of 50 targets out to 125 nautical miles) replacing original first-run models in service. The Indian Air force operates the A-50E/I variant which includes Israeli EL/W-2090 series radar as well as Aviadvigatel PS-90 A-76 series turbofan engines, the same as fitted to the Ilyushin IL-76 family as well as the Tupolev Tu-204 narrow-body airliner and Ilyushin IL-96 wide-body airliner breeds.\n\r\nThe A-50I was a planned variant for the Chinese Air Force to be outfitted with Israeli radar but pressure put on the Israelis by the Americans forced the cancellation of this design.\n\r\nSeveral 'one-off' aircraft have also been developed: Izdeliye-676 and Izdeliye-776 both were designed along the lines of 'telemetry and tracking' platforms. Izdeliye-976 (SKIP) was added as a cruise missile support vehicle (serving missile tracking). Izdeliye-1076 became a 'special mission' aircraft.\n\r\nThe Russian Air Force has about 22 x A-50M models currently (2017) in service with another 4 x A-50U on hand. The Indian Air Force maintains a stable of five and these serve with No.50 Squadron out of Agra Air Force Station in north-central India.\n\r\nThe A-50 has been identified through satellite imagery as actively deployed in Syria during the ongoing Syrian Civil War (2011-Present) which includes Russian involvement on the side of the Assad regime.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Beriev A-50 (Mainstay)", "aircraft_type": "Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) Aircraft"}, {"id": "f460f3f3-c2f6-4e81-b0b6-732a04899905", "year_model": "2022", "description": "\r\n        \tThe DJI Mavik is an off-the-shelf quadcopter series originating from DJI of Shenzhen, China and belongs to a product line that currently (2022) includes the \"MAVIC 2 PRO\", \"MAVIC PRO Platinum\", \"MAVIC 2 ZOOM\", \"AIR\", \"AIR 2\", \"AIR 2S\", \"MINI SE\", \"MINI 2\", and the lineup's flagship product - the \"MAVIC 3\" (the focus of this article).

It was developed by the Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center of Iran with production handled by HESA (and based in the earlier \"Shahed-123\" which became a redesignation of the \"HESA-100\"). It appeared during September 2012, remains in active production and may have been procured by the Syrian government for its long-running civil war campaign begun in 2011. The Shahed-129 was debuted in mid-2012.\n\r\nExternally, the Shahed-129 seems to mimic the form of foreign types like the Israeli Hermes 450 and British Watchkeeper UAVs and can be assumed to offer similar over-battlefield capabilities. A tubular fuselage is used to house the engine, fuel stores, avionics and reconnaissance-minded mission payload. A \"blister\" assembly housing the primary optics fit is set under the aircraft, aft of the nose section, offering unobstructed 360-degree views. The wings are shoulder-mounted along the fuselage sides and of a straight design with each supporting a single hardpoint. The hardpoints hold a twin-rail launcher to carry up to two Sadid-1 missiles each - giving the Shahed-129 a four-shot capability. The undercarriage is wheeled though fixed in place during flight (as in the American Predator). The tail is made up of two outward-canted vertical fins and the engine drives a three-bladed unit in a \"pusher\" configuration at rear. The air scoop is noted under the tail.\n\r\nIn practice, the Shahed-129 relies on a Ground Control Station (GCS) for direct-control flying but can also take on pre-set waypoint travel through autonomous flight. Range is limited by the communications technology in play but enough to provide a useful patrolling capability for the Iranian Army and Navy services. Its dual-role (reconnaissance and attack) design allows for active patrolling of a given area and direct- attack capability from a single platform. Missile attacks can focus on land-based targets (such as vehicles and fortifications) as well as sea-borne ones like enemy patrol ships - the latter crucial for maintaining control over Persian Gulf water routes.

The engine of choice was to eventually become the Kuznetsov NK-4 series.\n\r\nA prototype of the Ilyushin design was revealed in June of 1957 and testing ensued throughout thate summer with a first-flight recorded on July 4th, 1957. The Il-18 was selected to succeed the aging line of Il-14 aircraft on the Ilyushin production lines and the initial market form became known as the \"Il-18A\", this offering seating 89. The engines, the NK-4 series, proved so unreliable that a move was made to the competing Ivchenko AI-20 after only twenty aircraft were completed with the original engine fit. The shift in powerplant then produced the \"Il-18B\" designation and a prototype of this form first flew on September 30th, 1958 and became the first major mark of the series. Then followed the Il-18 \"Combi\" which combined passenger and cargo functionality into one suitable airframe.\n\r\nThe Il-18D carried more powerful AI-20M engines (4,250 horsepower) and increased seating for up to 122 as well as an extra internal fuel tank for increased ranges. A communications model was born from this mark as well and three were produced to the standard for the Russian government. The Il-18D \"Pomor\" was a one-off Il-18D model for use in the fisheries industry. The Il-18D \"Salon\" was the VIP transport version of the Il-18D line.\n\r\nThe Il-18D featured a crew of nine with up to 120 passengers. It sported a length of 35.9 meters with a wingspan of 37.4 meters and height of 10 meters. Empty weight was listed at 35,000 kilograms with a MTOW of 64,000 kg. Maximum speed was 675 kmh and cruising was int eh 625 kmh range. Operational range was 6,500 kilometers and the service ceiling became 11,800 meters.\n\r\nA pair of Il-18D aircraft served as the basis for the Il-18DORR fisheries industry model. The Il-18E was based on the Il-18I but lacked the increased fuel capacity and, therefore, decreased its operational range. The Il-18E \"Salon\" was its VIP model. The Il-18Gr was completed as a converted cargo form.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-18 (Coot)", "aircraft_type": "Turboprop-Powered Passenger Airliner / Maritime Reconnaissance Platform"}, {"id": "98f9227e-7d5a-41d7-826b-35611330a017", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Ilyushin IL-76 heavy transport was debuted in the early 1970s, entered service in the mid-1970s and is still operating today - some 36 years after its inception. At any rate, the IL-76 has proven something of a success story worldwide with an estimated 960 examples delivered. The airframe has also become highly adaptable to the needs of its clients in varying roles. Roles include both military and civilian functions, in carrying military paratroopers or civilian passengers as well as heavy cargo hauling. Other roles have been pressed upon the IL-76 including that of Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), AWACS-type duties, airborne hospital, Electronic CounterMeasures (ECM) (IL-76PP), airborne command post (IL-VPK), maritime Search and Rescue (SAR), firefighting, \"Zero-G\" training for Soviet cosmonauts (IL-76MDK) and aerial refueling.\n\nThe Soviet Need\n\r\nThe Ilyushin IL-76 was born out of a Soviet 1967 requirement calling for a heavy cargo hauler capable of carrying loads upwards of 88,000lbs out over 3,000 miles at speed. This aircraft was to serve with both the VTA Soviet military transport service and civilian operator Aeroflot while replacing the prop-driven, heavy cargo Antonov An-12BP. Additionally, the new design would have Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capabilities in all weather types and inherent qualities to allow for operations from rough or unprepared airstrips. The aircraft would play a large role in servicing the remote, hard-to-reach outlying areas of the Soviet Empire. Ilyushin delivered on their concept - with a lead role played by G. V. Novozhilov - and the first prototype flew on March 25th, 1971.\n\r\nThe aircraft design made use of reverse thrusters and high-lift devices to help in its short-take off and landing requirement. The wings sported triple-slotted trailing edge flaps, near full-span leading edge slats and upper surface spoilers. The undercarriage was designed with rough field operations in mind, totaling twenty low pressure tires across five landing gear legs. Crew accommodations numbered seven personnel to include the pilot, copilot, navigator, flight engineer, communications officer and two cargo handlers. Though comparable to the American C-141 Starlifter in scope, the IL-76 proved dimensionally larger in size and with a greater operating weight at the expense of shorter range and a smaller internal cargo space. The IL-76 entered service in June of 1974 with a VTA development squadron to which NATO assigned it the codename of \"Candid-A\". Series production was handled by Tashkent Aviation Production Association of Tashkent, Uzbekistan beginning in 1975. During the Cold War, Uzbekistan was a republic of the Soviet Empire. \n\r\nA civilian conversion model - the IL-76T - was made available and was essentially an unarmed form with extra internal fuel in the bulging center wing structure. The unarmed IL-76TD was the last of the \"Candid-A\" production models. This particular model is of note in that the wings were strengthened, the avionics were upgraded and the engines were an uprated set of Aviadvigatel D-30KP-2 series engines. The engines maintained their power output even at higher altitudes. \n\r\nThe IL-76M was developed as a military variant and received the NATO designation of \"Candid-B\". This IL-76 could ferry up to 140 soldiers or 125 paratroopers as needed. The aircraft was protected with a twin-barreled rear stinger tail turret as well as Electronic CounterMeasures (ECM) pods along fuselage fairings and flare dispensers. The IL-76M was improved in the IL-76MD, essentially taking into account the improvements as seen in the IL-76TD.\n\r\nWhile the Tashkent facility is no longer in operation, the IL-76 still remains a critical component of the Russian air arm in the multiple roles required of it. It has proven a favorite performer of India and China as well, both maintaining military ties to Russia. During the Cold War years, some 10 IL-76s were leaving the factory floor. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, this number decreased substantially to only 10 per year.\n\r\nDespite the original intention to replace the turbo-prop powered An-12, the IL-76 proved that it could only compliment the former in joint operations - similar to the continued American use of the prop-powered C-130 Hercules family. As such, the IL-76 has never fully replaced the adequate and versatile An-12 in service. However, the IL-76 continued its evolution while in operation. Later production models featured improved maximum take-off weights and increased ranges and went on to set over two-dozen flight records for aircraft of this type.\n\r\nThe IL-76MDP was designed as a firefighting Candid, capable of dispensing some 44 tons of fire retarding liquid in two massive cargo hold tanks. These aircraft were fitted with specialized targeting and release instrumentation to assist the crew with accuracy. At the same time, the IL-76MDP could carry up to forty firefighters and \"weather changing\" launch cartridges when needed.\n\r\nThe IL-76PP is notable in its dedicated role as an ECM aircraft. Developed from the IL-76MD, the IL-76PP was given a longer undercarriage and fitted Landysh avionics equipment. Another IL-76MD development became the dedicated IL-76VPK command post sporting antenna, a ventral radome and various probes.\n\nBeriev Modifications\n\r\nBeriev took to converting the IL-76 as an Airborne Early Warning (AEW) platform sometime in the 1970s to replace the outgoing Tupolev Tu-126 \"Moss\". The Tu-126 became Russia's first AEW platform and was nothing more than a conversion of the Tu-114 commercial airliner. The new Beriev aircraft came under the designation of A-50 \"Mainstay\" and development began as far back as 1969. These aircraft were based on the IL-76MD models and fitted with Liana radar. First flight was achieved on December 19th, 1978, and the type finally entered service in 1984 with 24 examples. The A-50 was made identifiable by its saucer-type radome on a fuselage stem and manned by fifteen crewmembers. This system was inevitably improved in the A-50U appearing in 1995 and quickly replaced the first-run models. U-models sported Vega-M Shmel-II radar with simultaneous tracking of up to fifty targets out to 125 nautical miles. Israeli Aircraft Industries installed an Elta phased non-rotating radar array unit into an A-50I for its Chinese customer in 1999 but pressure from the United States forced a cancellation of this effort. The A-60 was a related airborne laser testbed while the IL-76SKIP/Be-976 proved a surveillance platform to monitoring missile launches and aircraft flight data.\n\nThe Ilyushin IL-78 \"Midas\"\n\r\nThe IL-78 (NATO codename of \"Midas\") was the converted aerial tanker form of the IL-76 transport with a three-point \"hose-and-drogue\" delivery system - two under each wing and the third emanating from the tail. Trials occurred in 1977 with a converted IL-76MD and the type finally appeared in service form in 1987 after a lengthy evaluation period -replacing the aged Mya-4 \"Bison\" tanker series. Fuel was installed throughout the wings and the fuselage. A standard crew of seven operated the aircraft with the rear tail gunner replaced by a rear observer. Applicable ranging radar and formation lights were located along the cargo hold ramp door, visible by any rear-approaching aircraft. The IL-78 \"Midas\" form is described in detail here.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-76 (Candid)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Transport / Tanker Aircraft"}, {"id": "8f699c65-69d0-4aac-98f8-14eb6e21c060", "year_model": "1984", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet / Russian military has received a great number of years of faithful service from its Ilyushin IL-76 line (NATO codename of \"Candid\") of four-engined jet aircraft. The series first flew in 1971 and was debuted in June of 1974 as a strategic airlifter to help Soviet forces support its interests around the world. Some 960 airframes were eventually completed with many exported to allies and former states - some servicing the civilian market as jetliners and others modernized into more capable military forms. In the 1970s, thought was given to modifying the type for service in the aerial refueling role as a tanker aircraft and this produced the IL-78 \"Midas\" of 1984. First flight was on June 26th, 1983. The type remains in service and production is ongoing today (2014) with 53 total units completed.\n\r\nThe IL-78 has its roots in a late-1960s initiative by the Soviets to produce a tanker offshoot of the IL-76 line but the bulk of the work to bring the new system to pass happened in the late 1970s thanks to evermore evolved forms of the IL-76 airframe that emerged. The IL-76 lost its cargo-hauling and management hardware during the conversion process  and was fitted with three refueling positions to service three awaiting/trailing aircraft at once. The aircraft utilized the proven three-point \"hose-and-drogue\" delivery system with a fuel dispensing position found under each wing and one under the tail. Trials were undertaken in 1977 through a converted IL-76MD airframe and this testing led to certification trials thereafter, spanning into the early 1980s. First deliveries were in 1984 and official service began in 1987 - replacing the outgoing stock of Mya-4 \"Bison\" tankers. The crew numbered seven with the rear tail gun position of the IL-76 replaced by an observer's perch. Additionally, ranging radar was installed as were formation lights at the cargo door ramp so as to be visible by the approaching recipient aircraft - particular in night time refueling exercises.\n\r\nOn the whole, the IL-78 retains much of the form of the classic Soviet IL-76. It features the large, high-mounted main wing assemblies each holding with two underslung engine nacelles. The flight deck is over the nose with a commanding view of the environment ahead and around the massive aircraft. The fuselage is very tubular and aerodynamically efficient with few protrusions apparent. The tail unit constitutes a single vertical tail fin with high-mounted horizontal planes in a \"T-style\" arrangement. The undercarriage is wheeled and fully retractable with a two-wheeled nose leg and multi-wheeled main legs under the mass of the airframe.\n\r\nOriginal production versions were known simply as \"IL-78\" and these carried up to 188,540lbs of fuel through two removable tanks held in the fuselage. The IL-78T was similar in scope though it kept the cargo-hauling capabilities of the original IL-76 freighter. The IL-78M of 1987 became the first true dedicated tanker form as it carried three large fuel stores in a fixed arrangement. The cargo door was removed (though the ramp was retained) as was the cargo management equipment. Carried fuel loads now reached over 300,000lbs. The export version of this mark became the IL-78ME. The IL-78MKI was a version delivered to the Indian Air Force (IAF) and were airframes completed in Uzbekistan with Israeli-based fuel transfer system and applicable equipment. The Chinese and Pakistani air forces received the IL-78MP which were tanker forms (removable fuel tanks) retaining some of their cargo-hauling and cargo management capabilities. Beyond these operators, the IL-78 has been taken on in limited numbers by the forces of Algeria and Libya. Ukraine also operates up to eight of the type. Furthermore, some IL-78 aircraft are operated privately by American companies overseas.\n\r\nPerformance from IL-78M models includes a maximum speed of 530 miles per hour with a range out to 4,535 miles. The aircraft sports a service ceiling of 39,350 feet. Power is through 4 x Aviadvigatel (Soloviev) D-30 KP series turbofan engines of 26,700lbs thrust each. Variations of this engine were featured in the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31\"Foxhound\" interceptor, the Ilyushin IL-62 \"Classic\" airliner, and the Tupolev Tu-154 \"Careless\" airliner.\n\r\nFrom March to April 2014, the Chinese Air Force acquired three IL-78MDs to help improve its long-range strategic ability. This initiative also falls in line with the long-term development of an indigenous strategic bomber currently on the drawing board for the PLA. The IL-78MDs were modified in Ukraine with Russian equipment. The PLA also relies on a fleet of twenty-six H-6U tanker aircraft - aerial refueling versions of the local Xian H-6 strategic bomber. The bomber itself is based on the Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 bomber of the early 1950s.\n\r\nThe IL-78M-90A is an all-modern, in-development version of the IL-78 series. It began flight testing in December 2018 and includes such upgrades as an all new wing with additional fuel cells and Perm PS-90A-76 series engines (as in the IL-76-90A transports). The engines will grant better fuel efficiency as well as greater power leading to improved performance specs (MTOW, take-off run, etc...).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-78 (Midas)", "aircraft_type": "In-Flight Refueling Tanker Aircraft"}, {"id": "7ce6de35-d2ff-4cb8-b163-0c759e664073", "year_model": "1992", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Ilyushin IL-80/IL-86VKP (NATO codename of \"Maxdome\") is an IL-86 four-engined, wide-body passenger airliner converted for specialized military service as an Airborne Command Post (ACP) / Command & Control (C2) aircraft. With the IL-86 developed in the early-to-mid-1970s, this mature airframe was selected for further development as a flying command post aircraft, resulting in the \"Maxdome\" offshoot. A first-flight involving a converted IL-86 airliner was had on March 5th, 1987 with deliveries following in 1988. Service introduction was unavoidably derailed by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 which led to official series introduction in 1992. Just four total aircraft were procured by the newly-minted Russian Air Force and this aging fleet continues in service today (2019).\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this IL-86 offshoot has been to support Russian governmental operations in the event of all-out war - namely nuclear war. This platform, therefore, is designed to keep high-ranking Russian personnel (including national leaders) out of harm's way, providing a \"flying headquarters\" of sorts while the situation on the ground is assessed and reacted to. In this fashion, the IL-80 is intended to operate along similar lines to the American's Boeing E-4B \"Advanced Airborne Command Post\" aircraft brought along by Boeing in 1974, these four examples built atop the framework of the classic Boeing Model 747 \"Jumbo Jet\" airliner.\n\r\nA chief identifying feature of Maxdome is the rectangular protrusion seen along the dorsal line of the fuselage just above (and aft) of the flightdeck. This contains a powerful SATellite COMmunications (SATCOM) fit. Also along the dorsal line are a series of antennas running from the flightdeck to midships. The nose section sees a fuel probe fitted to help keep the aircraft in the air for considerable periods of time (via aerial refueling).\n\r\nThe four IL-80 aircraft in the Russian Air Force inventory (though only three are thought to be operational) are operated by the 8th Special Purpose Aviation Division out of Chkalovsky Airport.\n\r\nThe Maxdome series is set to be succeeded by a newer design being developed atop the IL-96 (IL-96-400) framework. The IL-96 airliner is considerably more modern and provides broadened performance capabilities.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-80 (Maxdome)", "aircraft_type": "Airborne Command Post (ACP)"}, {"id": "af3fde9c-d7ac-4ecb-b298-d020e7596d10", "year_model": "1992", "description": "\r\n        \tIn relatively recent history there proved high demand for four-engined, wide-body passenger airliners leading the Russian-based (then Soviet Union) Ilyushin concern to develop its own market competitor in the \"IL-96\". The IL-96 was, itself, developed from the Soviet-era IL-86 (detailed elsewhere on this site) which went on to serve a limited list of Soviet-allied operators including Armenia, China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union (and later the reborn Russia), Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. None remain in civilian market service today (2020) though the Russian Air Force relies on four examples (in its IL-86VKP guise) for the all-important \"Airborne Command Post\" (ACP) role.\n\r\nThe IL-96 emerged from the ashes of the fall of the Soviet Empire which occurred between 1989-1991. Intended as a long-ranged counterpart to the in-service, short-ranged IL-86, the IL-96 was in the works throughout what remained of the 1980s, resulting in a prototype completing a first-flight on September 28th, 1988. The launch customer for the series became Aeroflot in 1993 but, the long-range, wide-body market was already being dominated by Western types from American-based Boeing and French-based Airbus - limiting the IL-96 today to just 30 total examples and these solely serving Cuba and Russia (including high-level governmental VIP roles for the latter).\n\r\nWithin this limited fleet, the IL-96 has only been evolved into a handful of variants led by the initial production IL-96-300 models. These were outfitted with 4 x Aviadvigatel (Soloviev) PS-90A turbofan engines of 35,300lb thrust and came available with a two-class configuration scheme able to seat about 260 passengers and fly out to ranges of 6,000 nautical miles. The planned, modified IL-96-300V, with its proposed dual \"Airstair\" access, was never furthered.\n\r\nThe IL-96M was developed as a three-class, 300+ passenger variant with Western customers in mind. This included a Western-style cockpit as well as support for the American 4 x Pratt & Whitney PW2337 turbofan engine. To this was added a 30-foot section of fuselage for increased operational ranges but differences with Boeing and the United States made sure this mark did not see the light of day. Similarly, the proposed IL-96T dedicated freighter model was doomed for at least the interim until re-engined with the local Aviadvigatel PS-90A1 turbofan and now built atop the newer, more capable IL-96-400 passenger-hauling form.\n\r\nThe IL-96-400 was based in the IL-96M complete with PS-90A1 turbofan engines and developed with a two-class configuration in mind, seating between 300 to 400 passengers and flying out to ranges of 5,400 nautical miles. Cuba ended up purchasing three of these aircraft in early-2013 while a single example was taken on by the Russian Air Force for the ACP role to succeed the aging IL-86 fleet. A short-lived version, the IL-96-400VT, was thought to have been proposed to the USAF for its aerial tanker requirement but held little chance in being selected by the service.\n\r\nThe IL-96-400T became the IL-96-400's dedicated freighter form and the IL-96-400TZ was proposed as an aerial tanker in 2015 for the Russian Air Force. It is unknown whether this mark has gained any steam in own development.\n\r\nThe IL-96-400M has emerged as the latest proposed form and features a lengthened fuselage and all-modern cockpit. This model is intended for service in the 2020s and beyond and is set to become the new in-service standard for the series. Able to carry just under 400 passengers, the IL-96-400M was, at least at one point, being partially financed by the Russian government.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-96", "aircraft_type": "Wide-Body, Long-Range Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "9286a0e7-9b43-4cf9-86ac-7ae018ac5b88", "year_model": "2002", "description": "\r\n        \tLong-time helicopter-maker Kamov of Russia produces the all-modern Ka-226 co-axial rotor light-utility helicopter that has since seen formal adoption by the militaries of Russia and India. The platform utilizes the Kamov signature co-axial main rotor arrangement, in which one multi-bladed main rotor is set atop another, which negates use of an anti-torque tail rotor unit. The rotors themselves carry an advanced blade design critical to efficiency and effectiveness. Under 100 units of this versatile helicopter have been completed to date (2018) with foreign market interest slowly growing.\n\r\nThe Ka-226 can trace its lineage to the earlier single-engined Ka-126 (17 built) of 1989 which, itself, was born from the much-earlier Cold War-era Ka-26 (816 built) of 1969. Work on the Ka-226 was begun around 1990 and intended to satisfy a Russian government need for a multi-role humanitarian relief platform.\n\r\nOn the whole, the Ka-226 shares a conventional design arrangement which sees the cockpit overlooking a short nose section, a centralized engine and passenger cabin, and a tail unit at the rear. The forward section of the aircraft relies on oversized panes for excellent vision out-of-the-cockpit. The flight crew enter/exit through hinged automobile-style doors along the forward fuselage sides. Aft of the cockpit (which sports side-by-side seating for the two pilots) is the multi-faceted cabin area.\n\r\nUnlike other similar light utility-minded helicopter types, Kamov engineers have fashioned a truly multi-role platform with their Ka-226 design for the entire cabin section is a module that can be readily replaced for different mission roles.

As seen in previous Kamov helicopter designs, the Ka-27 did not showcase a conventional tail rotor but was instead driven through two counter-rotating, three-bladed main rotors, one seated atop the other - this action counteracted the torque generated by one rotor assembly over the other.\n\r\nThe Ka-27 shares the same overall dimensions as its Ka-25 predecessor which means that very little in the way of onboard ship storage was revised to accommodate the Ka-27 upon acceptance into the Soviet Navy role. The Helix was crewed by three standard operating personnel that included the pilot, a \"tactical coordinator\", and an Anti-Surface Weapons Coordinator. There was also seating for up to sixteen passengers which lent the Ka-27 Helix well for the transport role when the interior is equipped as such (Ka-29TB).\n\r\nThe Ka-27 saw a first flight on December 24th, 1973 and was formally introduced during 1982 and some 267 examples were ultimately realized. These went on to serve both Soviet and Russian navies as well as the Ukrainian and Indian navies overseas. One of the Ka-27s offshoots became the modern Ka-31 which arrived in 1995 and serves in the Airborne Early Warning (AEW) role.\n\r\nVariants of the Ka-27 were led by the Ka-25-2 prototype. The Ka-27K served as the ASW prototype which produced the Ka-27PL (\"Helix-A\") ASW production model. The Ka-27PS (\"Helix-D\") became a dedicated SAR model and the Ka-27PV was its armed form. The PL was exported as the Ka-28. The Ka-29TB was developed as an assault transport with seating for sixteen passengers. A civilian market form became the Ka-32 and various sub-variants of this mark were later released.\n\r\nMilitary operators (beyond the Soviet Union/Russia) of the Ka-27 have gone on to include Algeria, China, India, Portugal, Syria, Ukraine, Vietnam, South Korea, and the former Yugoslavia.

The V-80 went airborne on July 27th, 1982 and evolved to become the V-80Sh-1 pre-production model. The Ka-50 squared off against the Mil Mi-28 \"Havoc\" - a conventional two-seat attack helicopter in competitive trials and was selected ahead of the Mil product in 1986. Funding delayed production for a time and renewed trials in 1994 did the Ka-50 project no better - 2000 saw the Mi-28 also selected for service. The Ka-50 became operational in 1995 and was produced through approximately 32 examples. Comparatively, the Mi-28 was introduced into service in 1996 and initially saw limited production for the Russian Air Force while Kenya entered the fray as an export customer (the Iraqi Air Force may become its next foreign operator of note).\n\r\nSince both attack types have been formally selected for quantitative procurement, Russian doctrine has evolved to include both platforms in future plans. The Ka-50/Ka-52, therefore, will be focused more on policing frontier territories of the vast Russian front while the Mi-28 will be utilized in the territories west of the Ural mountain range.\n\nBlack Shark Walk-Around\n\r\nFrom a design standpoint, the Ka-50 is very unconventional. The cockpit is situated forward in the fuselage with the engines just aft and t either side of the cockpit. Wings are fitted just under these powerplants and sport four hardpoints for a variety of ordnance options. Wingtip bulges are visible and field the aircraft's defensive anti-missile suite in the form of chaff and flare dispensers. Armor is such that all major components, systems and pilot are protected from weapon calibers ranging up to 20mm and 23mm. IR-suppressed exhausts and self-sealing fuel tanks assist the Black Shark in surviving the modern battlefield, important to consider when this type of aircraft is required to operate at low altitudes in hot zones. Engines are fitted high against the fuselage in an effort to keep the helicopter's critical powerplant system as far away from enemy ground fire as possible. The undercarriage - consisting of a tricycle-wheeled landing gear system - is fully retractable and promotes a \"low to the ground\" appearance when the helicopter is at rest. Construction of the Ka-50 involves more than 35% composite materials.\n\r\nThe most distinct feature of the Kamov Ka-50 is something of a Kamov-brand identifier - the twin contra-rotating co-axial main rotors. In this type of arrangement, the Ka-50 negates the need to balance the inherent power of the main rotor with a tail rotor unit common on most any other helicopter. In the Black Shark's case, the pair of counter-rotating main rotors (that is, each main rotor spins in the opposite direction of one another) balance the torque affect of one another out making for a stable and relatively responsive platform. It is a much noted fact that the loss of a tail rotor assembly to any modern helicopter more often than not spells certain doom for the system and crew alike. The Ka-50 makes use its main rotor assemblies to negate the possibility that the Black Shark can be lost through a direct hit on its tail section. As a result, combat survivability is greatly increased though at the expense of a more complicated set up. \n\r\nIn addition to combat factors, the deletion of the tail rotor assembly has a direct increase to the overall top speed, making it one of the fastest - if not THE fastest - attack helicopters in service. With power derived from the twin Klimov TV3-117VK turboshaft engines of 2,226 horsepower each, none of this output needs to be diverted to a tail rotor assembly and can instead be optimized to the centrally-located twin main rotors instead. Performance specifications include a top speed of 242 miles per hour (168 cruise speed), a range of 720 miles, a service ceiling of up to 18,000 feet and a rate-of-climb nearing 1,870 feet per minute.\n\r\nAnother noticeable design element present in the Ka-50 is the use of a single crewmember to command all of the available systems of the Black Shark. Though most contemporary attack helicopters utilize a dedicated pilot and gunner to split the tasks as related to combat, the Ka-50 provides the pilot a full suite of automated systems to keep the bird aloft and actively hunting. With attention given to this unique facet of the Black Shark's design, it remains to be seen whether the arrangement is actually a viable one considering the amount of instruments and systems the pilot must monitor and react to on any given sortie - particularly under intense combat conditions. In any case, the limitation of a single crewmember means the design also saves on weight that can be allocated to more vital components of the Ka-50 including armor and weapons.\n\r\nBattlefield survivability of the Ka-50 is given another major boost in the way of an ejection system in the K-37 ejection seat. Though quite uncommon in attack helicopters of today, the Black Shark features a complicated but life-saving process that can potentially save the pilots life. The system ejection process begins by having the twin main rotors ejected via controlled explosives followed by the ejection of the pilot a short moment later. This in itself sets the Black Shark apart from any other attack helicopter in this category and adds another thoughtful element to the survival design philosophy.\n\nWeapons Suite\n\r\nAs with any attack helicopter, armament is the true heart of the design. Available munitions include the latest in Russian anti-tank air-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft air-to-air missiles mounted on four external hardpoints on port and starboard wingstubs. The main weapon of the Ka-50 in the anti-tank hunting role is the tube-launched AT-16 Vikhr-M laser-guided air-to-surface anti-tank missile system. The missile has an operational range of up nearly five miles, offers armor penetration and can reach speeds of Mach 1.8. The Ka-50, and its two-seat variant, the Ka-52, as well as the Su-25T \"Frogfoot\" are all cleared for using the missile system. Additionally, the Ka-50 is slated to carry traditional gunship weaponry including munition-dispensing rocket pods featuring various warhead types. The Black Shark can also carry external fuel pods for increased range, gun pods and drop bombs as required. \r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kamov Ka-50 Black Shark (Hokum)", "aircraft_type": "Dedicated Single-Seat Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "8ab4baf1-e39d-49ab-9981-64507fefdf25", "year_model": "2010", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kamov Ka-52 \"Alligator\" (Hokum-B) is an upgraded form of the original Ka-50 \"Hokum\" attack helicopter line. While the Ka-50 utilized a single-seat cockpit, the most notable difference in the new mark is the twin-seat, side-by-side cockpit. Development of this attack helicopter began in 1994 leading to a first flight recorded on June 25th, 1997. While the Ka-52 includes a radar suite, additional crewmember, and all-new designation it more or less retains the same form and function as well as armament capabilities of the original. Additionally, the platform supports all-weather, day/night attack environments due to its various upgrades that include FLIR, TV sighting, helmet-mounted sighting, laser rangefinder, and mast-mounted radar antenna.\n\r\nThe Ka-52 is billed as an armed reconnaissance and combat platform able to take on the roles of assault, Close-Air Support (CAS), convoy protection, and armed patrolling. The helicopter maintains its weaponry under its short wingstub assemblies which allow for four underwing hardpoints. Onboard countermeasures, including signature reduction features, chaff/flare dispensers, and crew/critical systems armoring enhances battlefield survivability. Each pilot is also afforded K-37-800M shock-absorbing ejection seats. The twin-seat arrangement sports control redundancy meaning either pilot can manage the flight control aspects of the helicopter. The avionics suite is all-modern (complete with a high level of automation for reduced crew workloads) and the weapons suite flexible to support a broad range of weaponry. Attention has also been given to reduced maintenance and repair times by providing for better accessibility of key systems and components. \n\r\nThe Alligator features the Kamov helicopter trademark coaxial main rotors arrangement (2 x three-bladed systems) which eliminate the need for a countering tail rotor unit (this also increased battlefield survivability to an extent). These main rotors are driven by 2 x Klimov VK-2500 series turboshaft engines which support \"hot-and-high\" operations as well as cold weather service. Performance includes a maximum speed of 300 kmh with a cruising speed nearing 260 kmh. Ferry range is 1,100 kilometers with a combat radius of about 460 kilometers. Its operational service ceiling reaches 5,500 meters.\n\r\nThe Ka-52 carries a 30mm 2A42-1 cannon along the starboard side of its fuselage. There is limited traversal given which requires the pilots to position the entire aircraft in the direction of fire but overall accuracy is said to be better than that of a turreted chin gun seen in other modern attack helicopters. Beyond this standard installation, the wingstubs of the helicopter support Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), rockets, rocket pods, gun pods, and cannon pods as required.\n\r\nTo date, the Ka-52 has only been adopted by the Russian Air Force with possible plans to feature it in the Russian Navy as well dependent upon successful procurement of a new amphibious warship / helicopter carrier. The Air Force is planning on a Ka-52 stock of 140 helicopters with the Navy adding a possible 40 more units.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kamov Ka-52 Alligator (Hokum-B)", "aircraft_type": "Two-Seat Armed Reconnaissance / Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "a81fa86f-77bc-4b76-b708-a1336c3e38ec", "year_model": "2015", "description": "\r\n        \tThe medium-lift utility helicopter market is a fierce one and it therefore comes as no surprise that there are many participants in the field. Kazan Helicopters of Russia - once a contributor to the many Mil helicopter products -  now manages its own direction in helicopter development and manufacture. Following a failed joint venture attempt with Eurocopter, Kazan eventually struck out on its definitive own during the early-to-mid 1990s and formed its own in-house team of engineers with new product goals in mind. One of the resulting designs became a lightweight helicopter platform which achieved first flight on August 17th, 1999. Today, the product is known under the name of \"Ansat\", features several possible variations on the base design and is poised to generate some interest on the world market - particularly with many medium-lift utility types meeting the end of their useful service lives the world over.\n\r\nThe standard Ansat design features a crew of two seated side-by-side in a typical arrangement. The middle section of the fuselage is accordingly reserved for passengers to which the helicopter can seat up to ten in comfort. Additionally, the cabin can be configuration for various roles - both civilian and military in nature - which adds a quality of modularity to the product. The engine compartment is conventionally set atop the cabin roof and consists of 2 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PW2-7K turboshafts developing up to 630 horsepower each. The engines drive a four-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed tail rotor with the main rotor sitting atop a short mast while the tail rotor is offset to the starboard side of the aircraft. Large sliding side doors allow for relatively easy entry/exit of the passenger cabin and hinged automobile-style doors are used by the pilots at front. Vision out of the cockpit is expectedly strong thanks to large use of transparent windscreens where possible. The undercarriage is of a skid arrangement which allows the helicopter to land on unprepared surfaces with relative ease.\n\r\nAt least several major prototypes emerged from testing with the first leading the way in ground testing for a static airframe. The next prototype became was a flyable version which marked the line's first official airborne attempt in 1999. A follow-up prototype was identified a lengthened fuselage which increased internal volume and yet another prototype was granted new \"clam shell\" style doors at the passenger cabin, the lower section used as a handy stair case. The standard Ansat helicopter is listed with a maximum speed of 170 miles per hour with a cruising speed of approximately 155 miles per hour. Range is expected to reach around 335 miles with a service ceiling of 14,760 feet and rate-of-climb nearing 4,250 feet per minute.\n\r\nSuch a broad developmental approach has yielded several notable configurations being offered by Kazan: The \"Ansat-U\" is a military-minded helicopter trainer that features a dual-control scheme for student and instructor (this version has been accepted by the Russian Air Force as its next helicopter trainer platform). The \"Ansat-UT\" is another variant though featuring a wheeled undercarriage as opposed to the original's skid assembly. The \"Ansat-M\" is a MEDEVAC platform designed specifically for hauling two patient litters, medical staff and applicable mission equipment.  In an effort to interest the military market, the \"Ansat-UM\" has followed suit as a militarized MEDEVAC offering and can carry up to four patient litters. \n\r\nWhile these are all useful helicopter products, the most interesting offshoot of the Ansat line is the proposed \"Ansat-2RC\" - a vastly modified two-seat light attack helicopter model based on the Ansat internal workings. The crew are seated in stepped cockpits  and this has resulted in a slimmer fuselage  and thinner forward profile. The skid undercarriage is retained for simplicity and robustness as is the four-bladed main rotor, starboard side-mounted tail rotor and twin engine pairing. Standard armament includes a fixed-position 12.7mm heavy machine gun along the starboard side of the fuselage. Optional armament would be affixed along two short wing stubs each managing a pair of hardpoints. It is expected that the helicopter would support various Russian- and Western-originated ordnance products ranging from homing/guided missiles, rocket pods, cannon pods and even conventional drop bombs. An Ansat-2RC was displayed at MAKS 2007 to help prove the concept sound and generate early interest in the product.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kazan Ansat", "aircraft_type": "Multirole Lightweight Utility Helicopter"}, {"id": "09151ac0-1352-4990-91ea-ca18a615f8b7", "year_model": "2022", "description": "\r\n        \tIt is no secret that the nation of Iran seeks to showcase itself as a major global military power - this under the restrictions of long-standing sanctions. Its domestic military capabilities have been in consistent growth for the last few decades, giving rise to various new instruments of war including small arms, armored vehicles, air defense systems and - more recently - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Iran's collection of foreign-acquired and domestically-produced drones has grown considerably over the last ten years and each new promoted system has, in turn, promoted all new capabilities to its regional enemies and the world as a whole. \n\r\nOn September 1st, the \"Kian\" - said to be of wholly indigenous design and development - was unveiled by the Army and state-run media, offering the nation a new disposable reconnaissance-attack drone with a \"beyond-borders\" reach. The air vehicle represents one of the latest UAVs reportedly available to the service.\n\r\nIts design arrangement is relatively basic, characterized by a well-streamlined fuselage making up most of the aircraft's mass. The wing mainplanes are the only horizontal planes featured in the design and these members are set well-aft of midships, offering the needed flight control surfaces. At the tail end of the fuselage sits a single vertical fin. Internally, there appears to be a conventional propulsion scheme used in which a multi-bladed propeller unit is seated at the extreme end of the fuselage in \"pusher\" fashion. Video shows the Kian being launched from its support assembly (either on the ground or from the flat bed section of a truck) into the air under rocket assistance while the pusher prop is active. Once airborne (and the rocket fuel presumably is spent), the aircraft proceeds to the target/target area under the power of its prop-driven engine.\n\r\nIranian Army officials have detailed the Kian to have an operating ceiling of 15,000 feet with a range out to 620 miles. Design, development and testing are said to have all taken place within the span of twelve months.\n\r\nAs with other Iranian-born products, however, the statements and promoted videos should be taken with a grain of salt for the nation has made it a habit of featuring \"all-new\" domestic designs through media releases and field exercises before - promoting their precision and destruction capabilities without much evidence.

There have been several notable concepts put forth - including VTOL-capable (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) models - but few have materialized into viable in-service solutions for its Air Force, Army and Navy services. Kronstadt intends to change all that with their proposed Predator-class \"Orion-E\" MALE UAV displayed at MAKS 2017.\n\r\nLittle concrete information is available on the Orion-E as of this writing (2017) but a flyable prototype is known to be in existence. Construction is said to incorporate composites for robustness and as a weight-savings measure and specifications of the system include an overall length of 26.25 feet with a wingspan measuring over 50 feet. Its maximum payload capability is up to 440 pounds.\n\r\nOutwardly the Orion-E utilizes a long, slender fuselage containing the mission equipment, avionics suite, fuel stores and engine installation. An optics system is mounted in blister form under the aircraft's \"chin\". The engine appears to drive a multi-bladed propeller at the rear of the fuselage in a \"pusher\" arrangement (as in the Predator series). The wing mainplanes, set amidships, are straight in their design and feature clipped tips. Instead of a traditional tail unit, a V-style arrangement is used (as in the Reaper UAV) to dually serve as vertical and horizontal stabilizers.

The potency of the MiG-29 has since grown over the decades thanks to programs that have evolved the system from a deadly lightweight fighter to a potent, multi-faceted tool of warfare. The MiG-29 has proven a success worldwide with operators beyond the Soviet Union/Russia being Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czech Republic, Eritrea, Hungary, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Peru, North Korea, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Yemen. East German/German MiG-29s were eventually sold to Poland. Iraq no longer fields the Fulcrum while Romania has since retired her small fleet. Israel procured at least one example for aggressor training considering its most potent ally in the region would have been Russian-made MiG-29s. Yugoslavia is a former operator and these later fell into Serbian use during the Serb-Croat War. \n\r\nToday, Russia maintains some 445 MiG-29s in inventory as of early 2011. India also currently manages several dozen MiG-29s for its air force and navy air arms making it one of the primary export operators of the aircraft. North Korea operates at least 40 Fulcrums which were purchased from both Russia and Belarus. In 1997, even the United States purchased 21 Fulcrums from Moldova in an attempt to keep these Russian fighters from falling into rogue hands - giving American engineers unprecedented access to this fine fighter. Several of these MiG-29s went on to become museum displays across America. While an excellent proven fighter platform over the years, the MiG-29 has had her share of notable and much-publicized crashes, some resulting in fatalities. Nevertheless, her potency today is a far cry from what she was at inception and programs have brought about the best in her base design.\n\r\nBy the end of the 1960s, both the East and West were well on their way towards development of Fourth Generation jet-powered fighters. Fourth Generation jet fighters originated in the 1970s and introduced a myriad of new features to make for more capable, ever more lethal fighter mounts. The United States went on to introduce the venerable McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle in 1976 and the fleet was further strengthened by the arrival of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1978. The long-standing McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was still a fixture worldwide and since 1974 the Grumman F-14 Tomcat interceptor would patrol the skies wherever American carriers were. On the other side of the world, the Soviet Union was holding ground with their fabled MiG-21 \"Fishbed\" fighter of 1959 and the Sukhoi Su-15 \"Flagon\" of 1967. However, the Mikoyan concern also unveil their MiG-23 \"Flogger\" in 1970 which was then evolved into a capable ground-attack platform in the MiG-27. To counter new American and NATO developments, Mikoyan OKB was one of three Soviet firms tabbed with beginning work on a new Fourth Generation mount in 1970 - the other two being stalwart competitors Sukhoi and Yakovlev. Mikoyan-Gurevich became a household name in the dark days of World War 2, responding with the excellent single-seat, piston-powered MiG-1 fighter aircraft to match wits with German Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s.\n\r\nIn 1974, Soviet authorities detailed a requirement for a new lightweight fighter with excellent agility to replace the MiG-21, MiG-23 and Su-15 series along the Cold War frontlines. By this time, technology made it such that the new fighter aircraft could be fitted with increased digital processing and utilize the latest in missile weaponry as well as radar systems. The new development would be powered by equally-new engines and field an array of short- and medium-range air-to-air missiles as well as an internal cannon for close-in work. The fighter would be charged with direct competition against the best that West had to offer.\n\r\nMikoyan engineers set to work on the new requirement and, based on past operational experience of previous jet aircraft to their name, settled on a two-engine design layout from the standpoint that it offered up inherent benefits - not the least of these being better performance and basic crew survivability. The new fighter was christened the \"MiG-29\" and its early design forms presented an aircraft design not unlike the boxy Mikoyan MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" - a large, flat-bodied interceptor built primarily for speed and utilized to intercept aerial threats with missiles and radar. The new design featured a forward-set cockpit with a raise fuselage spine, twin engines buried in the fuselage side-by-side and high-mounted wing assemblies with an elegantly contoured wing leading edge. Engine exhaust rings were straddled by rearward-extending booms mounting the twin vertical tail fin assembly. The engines were aspirated by a large pair of rectangular intakes fitted to either side of the forward fuselage. In all respect, the design was nothing more than a glorified MiG-25 in its current form. Other designs then emerged, one even appearing to resemble the upcoming McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and still another seemingly mimicking the design style of the F-15 itself.\n\r\nIn 1971, it was resolved that the program should revolve around two distinct aircraft types based on the same overall airframe, only each were to be modified to suit different mission roles. This produced a dedicated interceptor form fitted with radar and increased fuel and a dedicated multi-faceted tactical fighter to work within shorter ranges and be faster to produce in number. In effect, each design was meant to counter the F-15 and F-16 in their respective primary roles. This approach also ensured commonality of parts across both mounts and improved logistics to an extent while also retaining inherent performance qualities regardless of mission role.\n\r\nOf the three competing Soviet firms, only Mikoyan and Sukhoi's proposals were selected for further development and it was Mikoyan that would eventually prevail - at least in the short term. Mikoyan moved ahead to develop the MiG-29 and the similar MiG-29A and different radar systems were trialed. Both designs also fielded a helmet-mounted sight (HMS). Interestingly, flight controls would be handled by a less complex system utilizing basic linkage mechanics as opposed to \"fly-by-wire\" controls becoming ever more prevalent in Western fighters. On June 26th, 1974, Mikoyan's submission was officially selected ahead of Sukhoi's two attempts and the legacy of the MiG-29 was born.\n\r\nHowever, in a turn of events on January 19th, 1976, Soviet authorities opted to develop a heavier dedicated fighter platform to match the F-15 directly and classified the MiG-29 as a \"lightweight\" fighter design meant to counter the reach of the F-16 directly. This initiative officially gave rise to the development of the much larger and highly-capable Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" series detailed elsewhere on this site. The two aircraft would, therefore, become the next generation mounts to welcome all upcoming Soviet fighter pilots and be fielded in strength side-by-side throughout the 1980s and 1990s while still serving operationally today. Interestingly, both fighters would also represent the first Soviet use of computer controlled avionics which further leveled the playing field between the Soviet Air Force and offerings of the West. New radar would also be developed specifically for these new breeds as would be more lethal air-to-air missiles based on the latest technologies available. The MiG-29 would. therefore, be more of a point defense fighter while the Su-27 would serve in the long-range role.\n\r\nDevelopment of the MiG-29 was no small feat for the Soviet aviation industry that generally lagged behind the West in terms of innovation. The MiG-29 program itself was to be a formidable foray into largely unknown territories and caution was exercised when possible in an effort to produce the very best end-product. Construction of the MiG-29 involved use of aluminum-lithium based alloys as well as composites, both measures to ensure that the airframe met Soviet weight specifications. Automatic flaps and LERXES would figure into the mix to provide for superb control and outstanding agility. Vision out of the cockpit was excellent thanks to a raised position and afforded the pilot a commanding view of the action ahead from all pertinent angles.\n\r\nMikoyan delivered their first of fourteen prototypes in the first \"Aircraft 901\" which more or less mimicked the design lines as found in production-quality MiG-29s to a certain extent. One major difference came in the well-forward positioning of the nose landing gear leg. Western observers were convinced that the new Soviet fighter featured \"swing wing\" (or variable geometry wing) technology to match the F-14 Tomcat, General Dynamics F-111 or the British Panavia Tornado but this was not the case - wings on the MiG-29 prototype were fixed in place and stemmed from a fixed fuselage root extension area - perhaps giving the impression to some of swing wings being used. The cockpit was held well-forward in the design with excellent visibility throughout. Large rectangular intake openings, slightly canted inwards at their top edges, were fitted under the fuselage and straddled the central tubular fuselage nacelle. Engines were low-set in the fuselage with wings shoulder-mounted. There were a pair of vertical tail fins outboard of each engine mount. Wings featured noticeable sweep along the leading edges and lesser sweep along the trailing edge. Horizontal tailplanes were fitted well-aft in the design, extending beyond the reach of the jet exhaust rings. The undercarriage was fully-retractable and of the tricycle arrangement with a pair of single-wheeled main landing gear legs and a double-wheeled nose landing gear. So as to not ingest potentially harmful field debris, the intakes could be sealed, taking in air from the leading edges during startup and taxiing actions. In many ways, the finalized form was not wholly unlike the original MiG-29 vision that borrowed so heavily from the MiG-25 - just excessively streamlined for a new generation of Soviet airman.\n\r\nFirst flight of the MiG-29 prototype was recorded on October 6th, 1977. After early evaluations of the system in flight, the nose landing gear was moved more aft to combat the leg perhaps encouraging the ingesting of debris into the awaiting intake systems for each engine. Direction stability was also improved by the addition of ventral strakes. Controlled spins were enacted by test pilots and it was soon found that the MiG-29's airframe design could actually self-recover our of potentially deadly in-air spins that would doomed most other aircraft. During development, another prototype - Aircraft 908 - was lost to an engine failure during a flight. The production-quality MiG-29 prototype became prototype Aircraft 917 and was noted for its extended rudder bases. Prototype Aircraft 918 then followed and was completed with an intact fire control radar (FCR) system. It was further used in testing of a possible navalized MiG-29 complete with an arrestor hook for carrier landings. Other prototypes followed that included a two-seat conversion trainer and mounts dedicated to the testing of specific onboard systems and components. \n\r\nIn 1979, the US Pentagon received a blurry satellite overhead profile image of what was the actual prototype MiG-29 and, in accordance with past NATO designation standards, afforded the new Soviet model the nickname of \"Fulcrum\". The image was not overly clear and subsequent artist impressions of the aircraft were well-off base and led to much deviation. Once further versions of the aircraft were identified, the primary fighter variant became known to NATO as \"Fulcrum-A\". The MiG-29 was formally introduced into the Soviet Air Force in August of 1983 and operational service was achieved in 1984. The first operating wing became the 234th Proskoorovskiy Fighter Wing. At their peak, some 800 MiG-29s would stock the inventory of the Soviet Union / Russia across 25 different fighter groups. The largest group was naturally stationed in East Germany to showcase the new fighter against its Western counterparts. In 1988, the MiG-29 was demonstrated to audiences at Farnborough, UK. There, pilots entertained crowds with an unprecedented \"tailslide\" maneuver - a feat which, up to this point, had never been accomplished by a combat aircraft.\n\r\nIn 1991, the political climate across Europe saw the end of the Cold War, essentially bringing an end to Soviet rule in the region and an end to the Soviet Empire proper. Russia entered a period of uncertainty and defense funding was drastically cut from what was enjoyed throughout the blank-check \"glory days\" of the Cold War prior. Production of MiG-29s was therefore slowed to the point of near full stoppage. The reunification of Germany allowed Western observers full access to East German MiG-29s for extensive scrutiny.\n\r\nThe original MiG-29 was fitted with a pair of Klimov RD-33 series afterburning turbofan engines delivering up to 18,300lbs of thrust each. This supplied the mount with a top speed in excess of Mach 2.25 (1,490 miles per hour), a service ceiling of nearly 60,000 feet and a range of 888 miles on just internal fuel. Performance was such that the MiG-29 could get airborne and achieve vertical flight within a short amount of time. Standard armament was a 1 x GSh-30-1 internal cannon which could be supplemented with external ordnance across seven hardpoints, six underwing and a fuselage centerline position. Such munition options included air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles and conventional drop bombs as well as external fuel stores and Electronic CounterMeasure (ECM) pods.\n\r\nThe Fulcrum sported excellent maneuverability and could maintain a high angle-of-attack (AoA) at top flight speeds. Agility was equally excellent and low-speed handling a true strength. Targeting was possible through the internal RP-29 pulse-Doppler radar suite that allowed for \"look down, shoot down\" capability - a must for modern aircraft. The pilot's helmet-mounted sight delivered pertinent target information and could be used to guide infrared air-to-air missiles towards a target that were not in the immediate vision arc of the HUD (Heads-Up Display). The integrated IRST system allowed for passive detection and engagement of multiple enemy aircraft. As mentioned above, prevention of debris ingestion into the low-slung intake openings during warm up and taxiing actions was handled by the automatically sealing intake doors. Upon the aircraft beginning to move, the leading edge inlets would give way to the primary intakes.\n\r\nThe MiG-29 was naturally branched out into a two-seat conversion trainer variant and designated by Mikoyan as \"MiG-29UB\". The type first flew on April 28th, 1981 and development involved three prototypes. The major obvious difference in this model was its two-seat, tandem cockpit arrangement with its rear-hinged canopy. To make room for the second cockpit, the production model's fire control radar was omitted but for the most part the MiG-29UB stayed faithful and fully combat-capable and, as such, could be relatively easily converted back into its combat form if need be. Without the radar, however, student pilots could only train for air-to-air missions. Upon identification of this model within NATO, the nickname of \"Fulcrum-B\" was afforded.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG-29 (Fulcrum)", "aircraft_type": "Lightweight Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "cb0c7740-cefb-4e2d-934f-693ef1e537f8", "year_model": "1979", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MiG-31 \"Foxhound\" was developed as an off-shoot of the record-setting MiG-25 \"Foxbat\". The Foxbat was of a fast breed of aircraft, but agile it was not. It was an airframe built simply to intercept incoming aerial threats utilizing its own powerful engines, an equally powerful radar system and long-range missiles to achieve altitude, head over distances at speed and unleash a potent payload against a target. However, the MiG-25 lacked adequate control at low-altitudes, was strictly a high-altitude weapon and relied on ground-based radar for intercepts. The MiG-31, though externally resembling the MiG-25, was essentially an all-new aircraft with more powerful engines, low-altitude lethality and a second crewman in a rear cockpit to specifically manage the expanded radar suite. Despite its 1980s lineage, the Colds War-era MiG-31 \"Foxhound\" remains in service today and still maintains the title for heaviest operational interceptor anywhere in the world, weighing in at some 61.7 tons.\n\r\nThe original MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" was developed in response to the North American XB-70 Valkyrie jet-powered, strategic bomber program ongoing in the United States. While the XB-70 was eventually cancelled amid ballooning project costs and the advent of intercontinental ballistic missile technology, MiG-25 development had proceeded to the point that production of the new interceptor was a certainty. By the time it joined active frontline Soviet forces, the \"Foxbat\" had already proven itself as a record-setting airframe, capable of Mach 3.0 speeds and fitting a capable radar coupled with the largest air-to-air missiles ever mounted on a military aircraft. This made the MiG-25 one complete and, ultimately, deadly interceptor worthy of note in the West. The MiG-25 appeared at a time in Soviet history when its air defense network had begun showing its age and the West was in development of far more technologically superior weaponry. The Foxbat helped to shore up several lacking elements in the umbrella of Soviet air defenses and, along with it, came a major move to upgrade all facets of protection across Soviet airspace. Key ensuing developments became the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" and Antonov An-74 \"Madcap\" AWACS platforms to go along with the preliminary phases of programs that would eventually spawn the excellent Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" and Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" multirole fighters.\n\r\nHowever, the latter pair was not set to begin operational service until sometime in the mid-1980s. For the interim, existing platforms were fitted with evermore capable interception radar and even more potent weaponry. To increase the potency of the existing MiG-25 series, Mikoyan went to work on a newer, longer-range interceptor that could operate in the same vein without the need for ground-based radar. While the Foxbat pressed all of the mission workload on the single pilot, the new aircraft would split the workload between a pilot and a dedicated radar systems officer seated in an aft second cockpit.\n\r\nBeginning with the Ye-155M research prototype, Mikoyan set out to address both the speed and range limitations of their MiG-25. While a Mach 3-capable airframe, the MiG-25 could only reach and sustain such speeds in short spurts with the engines being prone to \"flame outs\" during prolonged activity. Engine life was short - rated at about 150 hours each - and they proved as fuel-hungry as they were powerful, furthermore limiting operational ranges. As such, Foxbat pilots were instructed to operate their engines in the vicinity of Mach 2.8 and regular operation of Foxbats as a whole was generally curtailed. In fact, it was a two-seat Foxbat trainer that would see more flight time than any of her single-seat interceptor/reconnaissance sisters. Additionally, the Foxbat - built purely for performance - inherently exhibited poor handling at low altitudes and lacked much in the way of maneuverability - she was not a \"true\" fighter when compared to the agile offerings of the West and never designed as such.\n\r\nA pair of Ye-155M prototypes were selected to undergo a \"two-stage\" process in an effort to achieve a viable end-product. Firstly, the airframes would be used to test the new R-15BF-2-300 series engines which promised increased output - up to 7,250 more pounds of thrust than that as fielded on the production MiG-25 - thusly increasing performance specifications for both speed and operating altitudes. Secondly, the airframe would be revised to compensate for the increases higher operating temperatures naturally found in high-speed, high-level flight envelopes. However, since engine testing went over the intended developmental timeline, this forced the second stage of development to be scrapped.\n\r\nWhile never fully accomplishing the intended project goals, the two experimental Ye-155M airframes - now designated Ye-155MP - were reconstituted as test airframes and refitted to evaluate the new Soloviev D-30F6 turbojet engines of 34,170lb thrust. To help facilitate flight at high speed in all altitudes, the body construction of the Ye-155MP was revised in make-up to become 50% nickel steel, 33% aluminum light alloys and 16% titanium (the MiG-25s makeup was 80%, 11% and 9% respectively). In all actuality, the Ye-155MP was expected to enter service as another variant of the MiG-25 line (to become the MiG-25MP). First flight was recorded on September 16th, 1975. Its all-new radar facility was developed in parallel and provided the aircraft with \"eyes\" to look above, below and behind the aircraft's relative position while being able to track up to ten targets at 124 miles distance. The radar allowed for engagement of the top four threats simultaneously.\n\r\nTrials of the prototype ensued and delivered several issues for the Mikoyan design team to overcome. Engine intakes were revised over that as found on the MiG-25 to aspirate the complex and fuel-hungry pairing of engines buried deep within the boxy fuselage. The airbrakes were relocated from their MiG-25 \"shoulder\" positions to under the fuselage intake ducts. Limited range was addressed with the inclusion of an in-flight refueling probe (the Soviets were not as keen to establish in-flight refueling practices as was the West). The fuel probe was installed along the portside of the fuselage and, though not a part of early-production MiG-31s, would become standard fixtures on later series models.\n\r\nThe MiG-31 began series production at the Soviet Gorky Plant in 1979. With the capabilities of the MiG-31 now fully realized by Soviet authorities, the system was quickly dispatched to critical operating areas as the ultimate aerial deterrent. Foxhound crews were now being trained for the intricacies of its two-person response methodology, interception handling and in the in-flight refueling process. The MiG-31 had officially arrived and some 500 production examples were ultimately delivered.\n\r\nIn the early 1970s, the original MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" was a largely unknown beast to the West - rarely photographed and much less known about its true capabilities. Early estimates by the intelligence community believed it to be a fast and agile fighter that eventually forced the development of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle air superiority platform in the United States. However, the Western assumptions of the MiG-25 - in retrospect - was largely incomplete. In September of 1976, all the notions of the MiG-25 finally came to light when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to the West by way of northern Japan. American authorities were eagerly waiting on the ground and quickly took ownership of the MiG-25 and set about rigorously testing the Mikoyan product. Evaluations delivered the system's true inherent strengths and weaknesses and leveled the psychological playing field to an extent.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG-31 (Foxhound)", "aircraft_type": "Long-Range High-Speed Interceptor Aircraft"}, {"id": "bb6f81a2-582b-467b-9a93-95acdf60643d", "year_model": "1981", "description": "\r\n        \tThe original Mil Mi-8 \"Hip\" medium-lift transport helicopter series first flew in prototype form on July 7th, 1961 and was introduced in 1967. Since then, over 17,000 examples of the type have been produced while the series maintains an active presence within the inventories of many air services today (2015). The Mi-17 \"Hip\" model - based on the Mi-8M/MT variant of the Soviet/Russian military - was developed with exportation in mind and has been adopted by over twenty nations worldwide. The Mi-17 model achieved its own first flight in 1975 and was introduced in 1981. Notable serial production has been ongoing since 1977 with totals reaching around 12,000 units with production shared between the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant as well as the Kazan Helicopter Plant.\n\r\nExternally, the Mi-17 product shares many of the same features with its earlier cousin including a well-glazed cockpit offering good vision, sliding side doors access with rear loading ramp, and fixed wheeled tricycle undercarriage. One discernable difference is in the tail rotor mounting which now faces starboard instead of port side. The cockpit area has been given improved protection through additional armoring and larger Klimov TV3-117VM turboshaft engines have increased performance - the main rotor and gearbox are based on those developed for the Mi-14.\n\r\nBeyond its traditional role of personnel/cargo hauler, the Mi-17 can be outfitted for the gunship role, typically through multi-shot rocket pods fitted along wing stub mountings. Other versions have been equipped for Search and Rescue (SAR), VIP/general passenger transport, high-altitude, MEDEVAC, Electronic Warfare (EW), and airborne Command Post (CP) service. It has seen its fair share of operations over active combat zones ranging from Cambodia and India/Pakistan to Columbia, Macedonia, and Sri Lanka. Mi-17s were used by both sides of the Libyan Civil War (2011) and the rebuilding Afghan Air Force relies heavily on its Mi-17 fleet.\n\r\nOperators currently range from Afghanistan and Argentina to Sri Lanka and Thailand. China began local license production of the Mi-17 during May of 2008 and, despite its Cold War-era roots, the Mi-17 remains very much in play today with several nations still considering order of the type.\n\r\nThe base designation of the line is Mi-17 and it is known to NATO as \"Hip-H\". The Mi-8AMT based model is the Mi-17-1 for export. The Mi-17-1M is its high-altitude performance equivalent. The Mi-17-1VA serves in the airborne hospital role while the Mi-17-2 is the Mi-8MTV-2. The Mi-8MTV-3 becomes the Mi-17V-3 and the Mi-8MTV-5 is the Mi-17V-5. The Mi-17V-7 is outfitted with VK-2500 engines and its loading ramp has been replaced by clam shell-style doors. The Mi-17M was a test bed for what became the Mi-17MD (Mi-17V-5). New avionics greeted the Mi-7KF. Night operations support was brought to the Mi-17N. General passenger hauling service was through the Mi-17P variant. The Mi-8MTG became the export Mi-17PG. The Mi-17S serves as a VIP passenger model. Various other designs have been added to the Mi-17 product line.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-17 (Hip-H)", "aircraft_type": "Medium-Lift Transport Helicopter / Gunship"}, {"id": "f7bf1dea-688d-4589-b513-d7f3bda1372a", "year_model": "1973", "description": "\r\n        \tThe famous Mil Mi-24 \"Hind\" helicopter stemmed from a Soviet Cold-War requirement for a heavily armed and armored transport helicopter following in the mold of the equally famous American Bell UH-1 \"Huey\" model. American activity in the Vietnam War considering their helicopter usage directly influenced the form and function of the Soviet design, developing one of the most iconic aircraft of its time. The type went on to see combat operations throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and continues on in a more assault-oriented role even today - despite its Cold War upbringing. The Hind remains a feared, flexible and proven battlefield implement. Its strengths have been formulated into the more potent Mil Mi-28 \"Havoc\" which is currently seeing deliveries to the Russian Army. While the Mi-28 is a more dedicated anti-tank platform developed specifically to combat enemy armor with crew and systems survivability as a priority, the Mi-24 - its days appearing numbered - still finds a use on the battlefields of today.\n\nOrigins and Development\n\r\nFollowing the end of hostilities that was the Korean War, attention turned to the evolving nature of the battlefield as it related to the helicopter. The Korean War saw the first large-scale use of the helicopter in a variety of roles and the Soviet Army lacked any viable use of the vehicle type. War across Europe - should the Cold War ever go hot - would involve the coordination of thousands of troops coupled with air support and ground support to wage an effective war along multiple fronts. While armored vehicle carriers certainly had their place in Soviet doctrine, thought was given to move mechanized warfare into a new category by delivering a heavily armed assault helicopter capable of transporting combat-ready personnel into critical situations.\n\r\nVarious designs were tossed about with the Soviet firm of Mil heading the initiative. American involvement in the Vietnam War ushered in the new and viable concept of the armed helicopter as both transport and gunnery platform and Soviet authorities were convinced of a similar design. The Soviets initially took to arming their Mil Mi-4 \"Hound\" helicopters for the role but this was nothing more than an interim attempt. Mil - with founder Mikhail Mil in the lead role himself - eventually was tabbed for the endeavor and the ground work was laid for a competing armed helicopter of Soviet origin. The formal Soviet request occurred on May 6th, 1968 for a heavily armed and armored, twin-engine helicopter of great capability an survivability. The official Mil design (to be known as the Mi-24) was signed off in February of 1969.\n\r\nDevelopment of the new helicopter essentially stemmed from the strengths of Mil's preceding product - the Mi-8 \"Hip\". This included the engine arrangement as well as a slightly-modified main rotor attached to a two-person cockpit ahead of a passenger cabin. The fuselage was all-new in its design approach, intended to provide a much smaller head-on target to the enemy. The cockpit design saw the pilot and co-pilot seated in tandem under a joined glass cockpit, heavily framed and boxy in appearance.\n\r\nFirst flight of a prototype occurred on September 19th, 1969, this days after a tethered prototype went airborne. These prototypes were eventually joined y ten developmental vehicles which eventually culminated in evaluations beginning June of 1970. This produced several design changes to the original arrangement (including flipping the direction of the tail rotor and adding the Hind-style ordnance-carrying wings to the mix). The type was finally accepted for serial production and formally introduced into Soviet military service in 1972 - beginning the legacy of what would become the most remembered and identifiable Soviet military machine of the Cold War and staff multitudes of inventories of Warsaw Pact nations. Its initial inception and ultimate global reach became a serious concern to NATO warplanners throughout the Cold War.\n\r\nAfter some operational practice, the cockpit was redesigned to the more familiar Hind shape including two separate, stepped cockpits for better visibility and improved protection from ground-based fire. Additionally, the passenger-carrying quality was lessened as the attack role grew and munitions options took precedence over that of delivering troops to the field. The passenger cabin was later utilized for the carrying of \"refill\" AT-2 series \"Swatter\" anti-tank missiles. The changes - producing the well-known \"Hind-D\" line - helped the Hind grow its performance specifications while reducing its fragility in combat - particularly in the volatile low-level altitudes it was intended to operate in.\n\nHind Walk-Around\n\r\nIn taking the most widely-seen and accepted Hind helicopter form as our basis, the design is dominated by its stepped, two-person cockpit which seats the pilot in the rear and the gunner at the front.  Each position is armored and covered over in heavy, framed bubble glass panels with the front-most gaining the benefit of windshield wiper blades to combat the elements. The glass panels were bulletproof against small arms fire. The pilot's cockpit door was set to open to starboard whilst the gunner's door opened to the portside. The engines are stacked above and behind the cockpit along the rather slim fuselage. The main rotor mast is low-mounted and powers a large, five-bladed main rotor system. The fuselage is slender and rounded along all facings. There is a oft-forgotten passenger cabin at the heart of the fuselage's layout, identified by its many vision ports. The empennage is set off by a high-mounted tail installation that delivers the shaft that powers the large, three-bladed tail rotor fitted to the portside of the aircraft. Horizontal planes are affixed to the rear sides of the tail section. The undercarriage is retractable and consists of a double-wheeled nose landing gear leg and a pair of single-wheeled main legs arranged in a three-point stance along the fuselage bottom. Armament is spread across three major underwing hardpoints. Each wing is mounted above and rear of the passenger areas and fit three hardpoint pylons, two inboard and one at the wing tip. Additional armament is fitted to the starboard fuselage side or, in some models, in an under-forward-fuselage gun mount. Additional optics and specialized equipment can be fitted to the forward fuselage as well.\n\nHind Power\n\r\nPower for the Mi-24 is delivered through a pairing of 2 x Isotov TV3-117 series turbine engines, each delivering up to 2,200 horsepower. This provides the stout mount with a top speed of 208 miles per hour and an operational range nearing 280 miles. The maximum listed service ceiling for the aircraft is 14,750 feet, consistent with other helicopters in this class. Considering the weight of the Mi-24 at 18,740lbs (when empty), a fully-loaded 26,500lb Mi-24 is a non-too agile beast, taking away some of its combat effectiveness when used as a dedicated gunship.\n\nHind Ordnance\n\r\nArmament is the heart and soul of the Mi-24 series. A bevy of internal guns have been fitted to the family line throughout her evolution. This has included the four-barreled 12.7mm Yakushev-Borzov Yak-B Gatling gun and improved through the installation of a 30mm GSh-30K twin-barrel, fixed cannon. For more flexibility, a 23mm GSh-23L cannon was also fitted in a powered turret after combat operations dictated such a development. Additionally, suppression firepower can come in the form of general purpose machine guns mounted at the cabin windows (when in the armed assault role). External ordnance carrying remains the forte of the Hind family line. This includes the mounting of integrated cannon or machine gun pods, anti-tank guided missiles and rocket pods. Additionally, the Hind can utilized conventional drop bombs for strategic bombing of enemy emplacements.\n\nHind Operations\n\r\nThe Hind helicopter series saw its baptism of fire in the 1977 Ogaden War (1977-1978) which involved Ethiopian elements pitted against Somali forces though the first major Soviet use of the machine was in the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghanistan War where Hinds operated in concert with low-flying Sukhoi Su-25 \"Frogfoot\" strike aircraft. The helicopter served in operations aimed at dislodging and disrupting rebel forces throughout the unforgiving Afghan terrain while being assigned to convoy transport and fire support missions as needed. The Mi-24 was designed specifically for such a conflict and made use of cannons, machine guns, rockets and conventional drop bombs in the regular sorties against its guerilla foe. While their heavy armament and armored systems proved well for the low-flying role at hand, these machines also proved vulnerable to low-altitude anti-aircraft systems - particularly the American-made, CIA-delivered FIM-92 \"Stinger\" short-ranged, surface-to-air missile. Despite high losses, Afghan rebels feared and respected the power of the Mi-24s and bestowed the rather terrifying nickname of \"Satan's Chariot\" to the helicopter. Despite the large Soviet commitment to the war effort, the Empire cut its losses in 1989. The last loss of life in the war occurred when an Mi-24 was shot down by Afghan rebels, its crew killed in the crash.\n\r\nThe next key showcase for the Mi-24 was in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War. These forms were the Mi-25 export variant and fighting for the Iraqi military. The near-decade long conflict saw a massive loss of life on both sides with little ground being gained in either direction. While Hinds played a large role, their armament lacked the latest in available technology and were also susceptible to ground-based fire. A most infamous role undertaken by Mi-25s in the war were in the much-publicized chemical-based attacks on unarmed Kurdish civilians in Northern Iraq. The conflict between the two Arab nations also saw the Mi-24 engage enemy aircraft including the recorded downing of an American-made Bell AH-1 Cobra and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II operated by the Iranians. Iraqi Mi-25s were put to use once again in the 1990 Iraqi invasion of neighboring Kuwait, sparking the 1991 Persian Gulf War which resulted in a stellar Iraqi military defeat. Into the 1990s, the Hind garnered an increasing reputation through the Croatian War of Independence, the Chechnya Wars and other world-wide conflicts. In the latter part of the decade they also saw operations in the Kosovo War.\n\r\nTo a much more modern extent, the Mi-24 has continued strong use of force in both the Afghanistan invasion of 2001 and Iraqi invasion of 2003 following the events of 9/11. Polish Mi-24 mounts have been used in support of coalition forces and even delivered six of its own Hinds to the Afghan military. In the 2008 South Ossetia War, both the Russians and Georgians fielded their own Mi-24 systems - the Russians inevitably holding the advantage in the lop-sided conflict. The 2011 Arab uprising in Libya has seen Libyan leader Gaddafi utilize his powerful Hinds against rebel forces. Several are known to have been lost in the ensuing figting.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-24 (Hind)", "aircraft_type": "Armed Assault Gunship / Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "a924d822-74d8-4294-85e7-b131cac51642", "year_model": "1983", "description": "\r\n        \tSince its adoption into service with the Soviet Air Force during the early 1980s, the Cold War-era Mi-26 (NATO codename of \"Halo\") has been the largest and most powerful helicopter anywhere in the world. This heavy-lift series was developed to replace the aging Mil Mi-6 series. The Mi-26 was given an all-new, eight-bladed main rotor driven by a pair of Lotarev powerplants which helped the helicopter become a proven performer in both military and civilian roles - serving well in humanitarian relief efforts through its impactful supply-delivery capabilities.\n\r\nThe Mi-26 is powered by twin Lotarev D-136 series turboshafts developing approximately 11,400 shaft horsepower each and these are installed atop the cargo hold section of the fuselage abaft of the flight deck. Performance-wise, this massive machine can reach speeds up to 185 miles per hour and cruise at 160 miles per hour. Range is out to 1,200 miles with a service ceiling of 15,100 feet being possible. The 105-foot diameter eight-blade main rotor features advanced design and construction and is paired to a five-bladed tail rotor fitted along the vertical tail fin facing starboard. The helicopter's cockpit cabin is set well-forwards in the design, overlooking a short, rounded nose cone assembly and offering excellent vision out-of-the-cockpit. The cargo area is spacious and suitable for hauling up to 90 infantry with gear, 60 medical litters with staff or up 44,100 pounds of cargo. Her power is such that she can be used to carry heavy construction equipment to areas traditional rugged Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft cannot. Entry/exit is through sliding side doors as well as a powered loading ramp at rear which opens at the base of the tail section. The undercarriage is fixed and wheeled, consisting of a traditional tricycle arrangement. The standard operating crew for the Mi-26 is five made up of two pilots, a flight engineer/loadmaster, dedicated navigator, and a flight technician.\n\r\nThe Mi-26 has evolved from its original V-29 prototype to appear in a variety of dedicated and specialized forms. These include modernized models, MEDEVAC versions, a dedicated Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform, passenger/cargo types, and an airborne heavy-lift crane version. There has also been a dedicated fire-fighting platform.\n\r\nBeyond the militarized versions of the Mi-26, there are also civilian market variants in service. Since its inception, it is reported that about 300 Mi-26 helicopters have been produced. First flight was on December 14th, 1977 with service introduction coming in 1983. Deliveries followed thereafter and full operational status was reached by 1986. \n\r\nThe Mi-26 was designed by engineers at the storied Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant in Moscow, Russia.\n\r\nAn Mi-26 Halo, with over 125 Russian personnel aboard, was downed by a Chechen surface-to-air missile system in August of 2002, killing all passengers and crew. More recently, Chinese Mi-26's have taken part in disaster relief operations in quake-effected regions of China.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-26 (Halo)", "aircraft_type": "Heavy-Lift Transport Helicopter"}, {"id": "e386b0f5-1c7d-4063-9f6e-f084899f285b", "year_model": "2009", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mil Mi-28 (NATO reporting name of \"Havoc\") was a product of the Cold War designed as an anti-tank attack platform similar in scope and function to the American Hughes AH-64 Apache series. As in the Apache, the Mi-28 featured an armored tandem-seat, stepped cockpit for a pilot and weapons officer, a chin-mounted turreted cannon and wingstubs along the fuselage sides for various munitions options - rockets and anti-tank missiles.\n\r\nThe Mi-28 system was on the drawing boards by early 1980 and flew in head-to-head competition trials with the Kamov-inspired single-seat, twin-rotor Ka-50 design. Though the eventual loser in the trials, the Mi-28 was still accepted for continued development and entered serial production in 1987 as the \"Mi-28A\" - being formally debuted to the public in the Paris Air Show of 1989. Though production for the initial mark did not last long (primarily due to its daytime-only operational status), the system was evolved in the Mi-28N day-night attack system (identified by the addition of a radome over the main rotor mast). Development of this new breed was slow as priority was still handed to the Ka-50 series and defense budgets were terribly slashed after the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991. However, due to the fall of the Soviet Union, the much-limited Ka-50 series began giving ground to the multi-role qualities of the Mi-28 which eventually superseded the Ka-50 as the standard Russian attack helicopter in the post-Cold War world. The proved more adaptable to the ever-changing conditions of the modern battlefield of the time, were more conventional in their two-crew arrangement and were less expensive to produce in the numbers required. After the protracted development of the new day-night Mi-28N (\"Night Hunter\"), an official introduction to the inventory of the Russian Air Force service occurred on October 15th, 2009. The Mi-28 and Ka-50 have since been fielded side-by-side, interestingly both now representing the Russian standard attack helicopter. The Russian Army received their first Mi-28Ns in 2006 as a replacement for their aging Mi-24 Hinds in the dedicated attack role.\n\r\nThe Havoc features a distinct elongated nose design which houses the required electronics suite. The crew of two (pilot in rear with the gunner in front) sit in tandem in a fully-armored framed cockpit capable of handling small arms fire up to 14.5mm in nature. The pilot (rear) benefits from the use of an advanced helmet-mounted display. Interestingly, piloting controls are not made redundant in the aft cockpit in an effort to promote strict concentration from either crewmember in his respective cockpit. Power is derived from 2 x Klimov-brand turboshaft engines driving a five-blade main rotor and a four blade tail rotor (facing starboard) while generating 2,200 horsepower each. Interestingly enough, despite its classification of \"attack helicopter\", the Mi-28 Havoc features a three-person passenger compartment  just aft of the main cockpit (similar to the larger Cold War-era Mil Mi-24 \"Hind\" series helicopters). However, this compartment is intended moreso as a rescue feature for downed airmen than for the transporting armed combatants into battle. Base armament of the helicopter is a powered underslung 30mm Shipunov 2A42 Autocannon in a chin mounting while wingstubs provide four hardpoints for anti-tank missiles, rocket pods and gunpods as required. The Havoc can, therefore, engage soft and hard targets at ease. The undercarriage is fixed and consists of two main landing gear legs at front  and a tail wheel at the rear. Overall design includes the forward-set armored cockpit, engines fitted high amidships, a long-running empennage housing the tail rotor shaft and a vertical tail fin capping the end of the aircraft.\n\r\nRussia remains the primary operator of the Mi-28 Havoc series though an export version has been offered to several interested nations including North Korea (Mi-28NAe), Iraq and possibly India, Algeria and Venezuela. Though only some 52 or so Havocs are currently active in the Russian inventory (as of 2012), it is expected that, at delivery's end (perhaps in 2015), nearly 70 systems will be available to the Russian Air Force. To date, a dozen make up a training squadron while the remainder form three regiments.\n\r\nIndian interest in procuring 22 examples of the Mi-28N (with Western electronics) remains, though the Hughes AH-64 Apache series may well replace the interest due to the complex and expensive nature of the conversion process required.\n\r\nThe Russian-Iraq deal for 30 Mi-28N helicopters was officially secured and announced on October 9th, 2012. This make Iraq just one of three formal operators of the Mi-28, joining Russia and Kenya - the latter having ordered 16 examples.\n\r\nMil has unveiled an all-new dedicated trainer variant of its formidable Mi-28 as the Mi-28UB. The platform is intended for those crew who will ultimately pilot the Mi-28N variant. The Mi-28UB features redundant controls at both cockpits to spread workload between the two pilots (unlike the single-stick configuration of the original Mi-28 production model). The new variant will potentially open sale of the Mi-28 to interested customers now that a dedicated trainer is available (previously, Mi-28 students trained on Mi-24 \"Hinds\"). The Mi-28 is intended as the modern replacement for the Mi-24 - though the Mi-24 itself has been modernized for its large export base as the Mi-35.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-28 (Havoc)", "aircraft_type": "Dedicated Twin-Seat, Twin-Engine Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "1de65671-c4e9-499d-a3ea-e317e7b45894", "year_model": "2005", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mil Mi-35 \"Hind\" became a major upgrade to the classic Soviet-era Mi-24 \"Hind\" assault gunships and transport series of heavy helicopters. When the Mi-24 received various system  upgrades, the Mi-24V model variant was born and from this came the Mi-35 which originally served as the export designation. The Mi-35 carries a multirole classification and retains the tandem, two-seat crew arrangement as well as passenger cabin of the original Mi-24 and weapons are still held externally underneath wingstubs as in the original. The system entered series production in 2005.\n\r\nCompared to the original Cold War player, the Mi-35 has been given upgraded avionics and navigation along with a digital glass cockpit for each crewmember. The helicopter is also outfitted with a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging device, and improved target sighting systems. Internally, the helicopter has received reinforcement of its structure for increased battlefield survivability. The five-bladed main rotor utilizes fiberglass construction and armament wingstubs have been shortened to help promote a thinner forward/rear profile. Additional work has been put into rough field and \"hot-and-high\" operational capability as well.\n\r\nThe changes added to the Mi-24 to become the Mi-35 have considerably modernized and broadened the Cold War product considerably. All-weather and day-night operational capabilities are considered strong as is over-water service allowing the Mi-35 to function in nearly any battlefield environment. Optional equipment includes the OPS-24N observation-sight system, upgraded Anti-Tank (AT) functionality, and support for non-Russian communications kits.\n\r\nBeyond the attack helicopter role, the Mi-24/Mi-35 is something of a unique combat helicopter in that it can ferry up to eight fully-equipped combat troops thanks to its cabin area set under the main rotor and engines. Additionally, this space can be used to ferry cargo loads up to 1,500 kilograms overall while a sling system allows for an additional 2,400 kilograms to be carried externally. Beyond these roles, the helicopter can also serve as a MEDEVAC platform for ferrying wounded and associated medical staff. Onboard survivability is improved through a modern Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), IR jammer, IR suppression system at the engine exhaust vents, cockpit and critical components armoring, and a chaff/flare dispenser.\n\r\nIts engine makeup is 2 x Klimov VK-2500 series turboshafts with reduced noise levels and maintenance requirements. The Mi-35 retains the Mi-24's fixed wheeled tricycle undercarriage. Maximum speed reaches 310 kmh with cruising near 260 kmh. Hovering ceiling is 3,150 meters with a maximum operational ceiling of 5,400 meters. Ferry ranges reach out to 1,000 kilometers with a combat radius of 460 kilometers.\n\r\nAs armament is at the heart of the Mi-35 system, the helicopter can boast an impressive dedicated or mixed array of weaponry. This includes up to eight Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) across the four presented underwing hardpoints. Rocket loads are either 80mm S-8 series or 122mm S-13 series munitions used alongside or in place of the missile armament. 23mm gun pods can also be carried under the wingstub assemblies while there is also a twin-barreled 23mm cannon mounted in the chin turret as standard.\n\r\nTo date, the Mi-35 has been taken on by the Russian Army as well as Azerbaijan, Iraq, and Brazil. Mi-35 represents the standard version based on the Mi-24V while the Mi-35 is an export night attack variant with improved sensors for low-light-level operation. The Mi-35M2 marks updated Mi-35Ms for service in the Venezuelan Army. Similarly, the Mi-35M4 is for the Brazilian Air Force though with Israeli avionics (as the AH-2 \"Sabre\"). The Mi-35O is a Mexican Army model with locally-developed FLIR system. The MI-35P is the export designation for the Mi-24P model which is closely related to the Mi-24VM and Mi-35M3 is used to designate export-minded Mi-24VMs. The MI-35U is an unarmed trainer variant of the combat-capable Mi-35.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-35 (Hind-E)", "aircraft_type": "All-Weather Heavy Assault Gunship / Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "9bd855d0-762a-45e2-ab8a-d98d0854f65b", "year_model": "1967", "description": "\r\n        \tNumbering well over 12,000 production examples, the Mil Mi-8 (NATO reporting name of \"Hip\") can be viewed as one of the most successful helicopter designs of all time. It has seen use as a passenger transport, troop transport, vip transport, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, assault, artillery spotter and airborne command post throughout its tenure with the various nations that have purchased the aircraft. Even today, the Mi-8 remains in use as an operational-level instrument in many of the air forces and army groups that have seen value in the type. As of this writing, production continues despite some 42 years since the first Mi-8 rolled off of the assembly lines at the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant - then  under the Soviet banner.\n\r\nThe Mi-8 was developed as a replacement for the Mi-4 \"Hound\", a piston-engined transport helicopter appearing in 1953 that could seat up to fourteen personnel. Utilizing some of the successful internal workings of the Mi-4, the new Mil design featured a single Soloviev turboshaft engine of 2,700 shaft horsepower mated to an all-new enlarged fuselage. The prototype took on the name of Mi-8 (\"Hip-A\") and achieved first flight on July 9th, 1961. Follow-up developmental testing soon revealed the design to lack in power and, as such, the single engine idea was dropped in favor of a twin-engined design featuring two Isotov TV2 turboshaft engines. A five-blade main rotor was also used in this revision which produced the second prototype, first flying on September 17th, 1962. Minor revisions followed and the Mi-8 was fully introduced in Soviet Air Force service sometime in 1967. The initial production versions all fell under the NATO designation of \"Hip-C\" and constituted the base militarized model and a civilian model (noted for its square windows instead of round). Since then, the Hip series has been expanded to include a plethora of upgraded and specially-designed versions.\n\r\nExternally, the Mi-8 maintains a most utilitarian look about her. She sports a low-slung front crew area with extensive glazing that offers up excellent views from the cockpit. Immediately to the cockpit's rear is the spacious crew cabin with side-mounted sliding doors. On most versions, the tricycle undercarriage is static (one such Hip offered a retractable undercarriage) which adds to the types distinct look. Two engines are mounted above and to the rear of the crew cabin area and power a large five-blade main rotor system. The empennage is also a distinct feature of this rotorcraft as it sits high in the design and sports a single vertical tail fin, horizontal plane and a three-blade tail rotor mounted to the starboard side (the similar Mi-17 mounts the tail rotor to port). A modified Hip system features a rear-loading ramp. The crew consists of a pilot, co-pilot and a loadmaster.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-8 (Hip)", "aircraft_type": "Multirole Medium-Lift Helicopter"}, {"id": "50a83ec2-6e85-49b4-b030-2ec79415b765", "year_model": "1981", "description": "\r\n        \tIranian engineers have been hard at work in building up local Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) stocks for the military. This has included regular Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) types as well as armed, munitions-delivery Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) platforms. The Ghods \"Mohajer\" (also spelled as \"Mahajer\") represents one of the former as it primarily serves as an intelligence-collecting system. It has been taken on by the forces of Iran, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela (the Mohajer-2 locally-produced as the SANZT \"Arpia\") as well as Hezbollah forces. Four major variants mark its production and service run to date with subvariants being developed as well.\n\r\nThe need for an ISR system came about during the bloody Iran-Iraq conflict of the 1980s which pushed Iranian industry to develop a local solution for its Army. This resulted in a collection of prototypes emerging in the early part of the decade to which operational forms were then used in actual war zones between the two neighboring countries. The original series was named \"Mohajer-1\" and began the line of Mohajer UAVs still in service today (2016). Beyond its use as a ISR platform, it is said that some models operated in the conflict were, in fact, armed with rockets for assailing ground targets - in essence evolving the Mohajer into a UCAV with broader tactical usefulness.\n\r\nFrom this work came a more advanced form offering greater operational range and improved navigation. The model was designated as \"Mohajer-2\" and took over production for use in the Iranian Army. As built, the Mohajer-2 was given a length of 9.6 feet and a wingspan of 12.5 feet. Its propulsion system consisted of a WAE-342 series 2-stroke engine delivering 25 horsepower while driving a two-bladed propeller in a \"pusher\" configuration (the propeller seated at the rear of the airframe). The fuselage was largely tubular in its general shape with straight wing mainplanes seated near midships (displaying clipped wing tips as well). Twin booms made up the empennage and a joining horizontal plane was featured between each vertical tail unit. Optics were fitted to a rotating blister assembly seen under the nose of the aircraft. Performance included a maximum speed of over 100 miles per hour, a range out to 90 miles and a service ceiling up to 11,000 feet. Endurance is about six hours of flight time.\n\r\nAdditional advancements to the line inevitably produced the \"Mohajer-3\" which further increased range and over-battlefield capabilities. Still further work begat an even more advanced version - this becoming the \"Mohajer-4\" - which, itself, has gone on to produce a pair of subvariants all its own. While retaining the general form and function of the Mohajer-2 line, the Mohajer-4 sports a boxier fuselage and three-legged undercarriage. The wing mainplanes also showcase wingtips cranked upwards.\n\r\nThe Mojaher series adds quite a bit to Iranian (and allied) actions in a region consistently beset by war and tribal/political struggles. Its evolution continues today (2016) and evermore improved versions are being worked on and tested. The line has certainly gone a long way in helping to propel local aero-industry to produce a self-sustained Iranian UAV industry.

While dominant examples in the UAV category of the world today are primarily of conventional take-off and landing, the Camcopter is a rotary-wing system with qualities more akin to a helicopter allowing for true Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL), not requiring use of long prepared runways. This drastically broadens the mission scope of such UAVs and makes for a multi-faceted, multi-role platform ready to fulfill a variety of mission requirements regardless of terrain for the discerning UAV-minded customer. The Camcopter S-100 is also billed as a solution that goes beyond military-minded use and can be operated in conjunction with law enforcement and civilian services. For example, such a VTOL system can be used in counter-smuggling operations, environmental disasters, data collection or real-time information reporting.\n\r\nAustrian-based Schiebel, the concern behind the Camcopter S-100, was founded in 1951 in the field of electronics and branched out into military products during the 1980s, specifically developing battlefield mine detectors. Schiebel then tried its hand in the field of UAVs during the 1990s ultimately delivering their S-100 in 2005. The first S-100 customer became the United Arab Emirates but recent interest has been received from the German, Pakistani and French navies. S-100s are produced out of the Schiebel Wiener Neustadt facility south of Vienna.\n\r\nThe Camcopter S-100 exhibits an very interesting design appearance that sports a shapely \"tear-drop\" fuselage. The nose is well-formed and dominated by a large grill assembly along its top side and vent slits along its lower areas. The deep portion of the fuselage contains the powerplant while the underside of the fuselage houses the variable payload facilities. The empennage is essentially a short tail section capped by a dorsal and ventral vertical tail fin. The dorsal fin also features vertical tail planes in a \"T\" arrangement. The ventral tail fin doubles as a tail skid in a three-point stance when the S-100 is at rest. The undercarriage includes the tail skid as well as a pair of wheel-less forward main landing gear legs. The two-blade main rotor assembly sits low against the fuselage spine while the two-blade tail rotor (used to counter the inherent torque rotation caused by the main rotor blades) is set to the portside of the aircraft. S-100 construction includes use of composites with a reinforced internal structure for the rigors and abuse of the battlefield - even in maritime environments. Dimensionally, the S-100 presents a running length of 10 feet with a width of 4 feet and a height of 3.65 feet.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Schiebel Camcopter S-100", "aircraft_type": "Rotary-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle"}, {"id": "492a97d3-805a-4891-8843-d1deb2204aed", "year_model": "2021", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sokol Altius us a heavy-class combat drone of Russian origin, the program established in 2011 with a first-flight undertaken in 2016 and serial production having begun in 2021.

The Soviet design was no doubt inspired by the impressive and powerful \"swing-wing\" American design and attempted to follow suit with an equally capable mount worthy of her Soviet airmen. After some 35+ years of active service, the end is near for the impressive Fencer, gradually outdated in many facets of her makeup. She was debuted in anger during the Soviet war in Afghanistan and saw combat in the Persian Gulf War of 1991, actions against Chechen rebels of the Chechen Republic and thought to have participated in recent operations over South Ossetia in the 2008 \"limited war\" with Georgia. In all, approximately 1,400 Su-24s have been produced by Sukhoi OKB in three distinct operational variants and delivered to a handful of foreign operators.\n\nThe Sukhoi Bureau and Their Su-7 \"Fitter\"\n\r\nThe Sukhoi design bureau had its origins in wartime 1939 and became something of a household name throughout World War 2. In the post-war world - 1959 to be exact - the firm delivered their first Su-7 \"Fitter\" jet-powered fighters to the ranks of the Frontal Aviation (Frontovaya Aviahtsiya), this being the tactical component of the Soviet Air Force. The initial Su-7 was a dedicated tactical air superiority fighter design while the follow-up Su-7B was introduced as a ground attack version in 1961. One of the pre-requisites of the Soviet Air Force's acceptance of the Su-7 into service was that the firm also develop a suitable all-weather strike variant to be tied with a new navigation/attack system known as the \"Puma\".\n\r\nSukhoi set about on some preliminary work in trying to utilize the existing Su-7 airframe for the all-weather strike task. It was quickly realized that the Su-7's airframe was ill-suited for the amount of additional avionics and equipment that would be required in making the Fitter a right \"fit\" for the role. As a result, other designs solutions were entertained.\n\r\nWhile introduction of the Fitter did well to strengthen the Soviet Air Force's aging fleet of fighters, there was no true solution in beefing up her long-range bomber arm. In the inventory remained the aged Ilyushin IL-28, introduced in 1950 and categorized as a medium bomber. The Yakovlev Yak-28 \"Bewer\"/\"Firebar\"/\"Maestro\" series was unveiled in 1958 and first flew in 1960, intended to become the answer to the growing Soviet question. However, once in service, the Yak-28 was quickly noted for its disappointingly short operational ranges and small payload capabilities - two qualities critical to a successful bomber design in the Cold War. Additionally, weapons firing and general munitions delivery accuracy left something to be desired by the Soviet Air Force. Regardless, some 1,180 such systems were placed into circulation and the type was developed to fulfill a variety of battlefield functions.\n\nThe F-111 Outshines Them All\n\r\nSoviet personnel were not blind to the aviation progress being made in the United States as per their USAF General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark twin-engine, swing-wing, two-seat fighter-bomber. The aircraft began its life in 1964 and was officially introduced in 1967, pioneering a variety of technological advancements in the realm. The F-111 featured a terrain following radar (as opposed to terrain avoidance radar), variable sweep of her swing-wing assemblies and an afterburning turbofan engine. Swing-wing capabilities allowed an aircraft to vary its drag during different phases of flight - landing, take-off, cruise. \n\r\nWhile practical in both use and design, a \"swing-wing\" approach often involved a complicated set of internal working functions that had to be incorporated into an already complicated aircraft design. Only a few aircraft have ever fielded variable sweep wings and this included such notables as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Panavia Tornado, Rockwell B-1 Lancer and Tupolev Tu-160 \"Blackjack\" - all appearing some time later. Terrain following radars served the aircraft by allowing it to fly at supersonic speeds just underneath the perceived radar screen and deliver munitions from this low altitude with accuracy. It should be noted, however, that the F-111 itself overcame a variety of obstacles during her development - these being both political and technological in nature - to become the 560+ examples delivered to the USAF. Success, it seemed, came at a cost from any angle. On the other hand, the new breed of military aircraft being fielded by the Americans now outclassed just about any Soviet offering at the time.\n\r\nOf similar note here is the technological advancements made in the world of surface-to-air detection and engagement - also playing a key role in the growing Soviet long-range bomber need. The current crop of Soviet bombers were ill-suited in their operations against such newer active defenses being fielded by NATO allies. For the Soviets, what once appeared to be a small hole in the dike initially had now exploded to become a bleeding chasm of desperation to some extent.\n\r\nSukhoi set to work to fulfill the new Soviet air arm requirement. They set their eyes on a long-range interdiction bomber design mimmicking the performance capabilities of the American F-111 without the complicated swing-wing functionality. The culmination of this early design work revealed the S-6, a mockup delta-wing model design fitting a pair of side-by-side Tumansky R-21F-300 turbojet engines. The aircraft would be piloted by a crew of two personnel seated in tandem, this helping to achieve a slimmer forward profile. While the design was ultimately reviewed, the progress was eventually nil as the \"Puma\" nav-attack system development was lagging sorely behind. Further tests of the mockup also revealed some key limitations that would ultimately doom the S-6 as a viable solution.\n\nThe S-58VD Flying Laboratory\n\r\n1964 saw the Sukhoi firm press their attention onto the \"S-58M\", a modified form of their Su-15 \"Flagon\" interceptor product. By this time, the Soviet Air Force came back with a revision to their original requirement and sought an airframe with STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) capability. This provided for something of a mechanical nightmare to the internal design layout of the new Sukhoi aircraft. Not only was the type to feature two afterburning turbojet engines for the supersonic speed requirement, she was now required to showcase STOL qualities through the implementation of four smaller turbojet engines for improved vertical ascension. The powerplants of choice became a pair of Tumansky R-27F-300 base engines and four Kolesov RD-36-25 series turbojets to fulfill the vertical thrust role. The radar of choice came under the \"Orion\" name. An existing Su-15 airframe was converted for the new engine arrangement to become the developmental \"S-58VD\". The new S-58VD was given a wider cross-section to make room for the crew of two seated side-by-side as well as the wider radar system to be mounted in the nose. Comparatively, the S-58VD shared a general overall external appearance to the Su-15 it was developed from (including the dual Tumansky engine layout and single vertical tail fin) but the wider forward profile quickly differentiated the type from the original.\n\r\nThe S-58VD featured a long, relatively flat nose cone ahead of the two-man cockpit. The pilot and co-pilot sat under a canopy not unlike that as featured in the F-111 Aardvark. Each professional sat in \"zero-zero\" Zvezda K-36D series ejection seats, allowing for ejections at any airspeed and at any altitude (in contrast to earlier seat designs that required certain speed and altitude minimums). The streamlined fuselage contoured rather elegantly into the squared-off rear body. Rectangular intakes were fitted to either side of the fuselage and this boxy shape carried on to the aft portion of the airframe. Wings were fixed and swept along their trailing edges in a sort of \"double-delta\" format, with each wing featuring a pair of underwing weapon stations. The tail section was dominated by the single vertical fin and applicable horizontal tail surfaces to each aft fuselage side (the latter all-moving surfaces). The undercarriage was conventional and made up of two double-tired main landing gear legs and a nose landing gear leg fitted a pair of smaller wheels. Of particular note in the S-58VD design were the four RD36-35 lift engines buried within the middle portion of the fuselage at about amidships. The upper panel of each intake sported doors meant to open and aspirate the engines when they were activated for STOL flight. The developmental aircraft was now assigned the more formal designation of \"T-6\" in 1965.\n\r\nThe S-58VD design itself would go on to become a flying laboratory of sorts, collecting STOL data from 1966 into 1969. Her captured information proved invaluable and showcased a loss of operational range over the gain of her STOL capability. Lift engines were always something of a peculiar love affair with aircraft engineers since the prospect of vertical flight was born with Leonardo Da Vinci. However, in 1960s terms, the devices required to achieve such flight were still rather large contraptions taking up vital internal space and making up critical weight increases for very little tactical gain. The areas within such an aircraft were best suited for the carrying of internal fuel stores to feed thirsty afterburning turbojet engines. Control of the S-58VD during the STOL process was also noted to be adequate at best, requiring much attention and direct pilot interference. True STOL operation would not be realized until the arrival of the subsonic British Harrier jump jet and perfected to an extend by the upcoming stealthy Lockheed F-35 Lightning II.\n\nThe T6-1 Prototype\n\r\nThe initial T6 prototype became the \"T6-1\", completed in May of 1967 and launched for the first time on July 2nd of that year. Initial evaluations were conducted sans the four lift jets to do away with early complexities during in-flight performance testing. The lift jets were not installed on the T6-1 until October of 1967 and the primary Tumansky R-27F-300 turbojet engines were later replaced in whole by a new pair of Lyulka-brand AL-21F series engines.\n\nThe F-111 Raises Eyebrows\n\r\nThe Soviet Air Force vision for the new aircraft was decidedly different than the T6-1 being offered from Sukhoi. Testing revealed that the design - in her current form - lacked the desired function sought. The 1967 display of the American F-111 Aardvark at the Paris Air Show only served to drive home the painful point - her variable wing, low-level flying was duly noted by aircraft firms all over the world - Sukhoi and her Soviet overseers being no exception. Her variable geometry wing design proved the swing-wing concept sound for a powerful mount such as the Aardvark. The Sukhoi firm finally steered itself in the direction of applying a similar swing-wing style function to their T6.\n\nThe T6-2I Prototype\n\r\nWork on a new T6 prototype began on August 7th, 1968, producing the T6-2I. The T6-2I was essentially the T6-1 airframe mated to a new variable geometry wing system though the four lift jets were formally dropped. First flight was achieved on January 17th, 1970 and testing continued on until 1976, covering some 300 total flights. Seventy-three flights were made by T6-2I in 1971 and covered basic flight dynamics incorporating the various wing sweep settings. Only later were more complex systems thrown into the mix (including the automated flight system) and most evaluations were handled at low altitudes. A second swing-wing prototype, the T6-3I, was included beginning in late 1970. The T6-3I completed 90 flights in 1971 and contributed 300 flights of her own. A fourth swing-wing prototype, the T6-4I, began evaluation service on June 16th, 1971 but was lost to accident in 1973 after completing just 120 flights. Final evaluation of the T6 program concluded in 1976 with various landing scenarios to test out the airframe during rough-field, unpaved operations.\n\r\nFurther development of the T6 eventually included the incorporation of the \"Puma\" nav-attack system coupled with the \"Orion-A\" attack radar. Terrain avoidance was handled by the Relyef radar and featured an automatic flight guidance system. The design was furthered into production-standard forms within time. Even before the new aircraft had completed her various test regimes, however, the Soviet Air Force - happy with what it saw in its IL-28 replacement - quickly ordered the type for production under the designation of \"Su-24\".\n\nFencer Production\n\r\nProduction was selected to begin at Factory No. 153 at Novosibirsk. The first production Su-24 went airborne on December 31st, 1971, with test pilot Vladimir Vylomov at the controls. Early Su-24s (\"Fencer-A\") were fielded in small numbers and this limited to trials units, leaving the Fencer-Bs as the true initial production face of the line. Fencer-C came online some time later and sported improved avionics. Though differences between the three were many, they were more-or-less minor enough to not warrant new designations from Sukhoi. Only NATO required the varying \"Fencer\" designations for their own nomenclature.\n\r\nHer rush to delivery produced a few teething problems from the start, forcing several  - though multiplying - modifications to be enacted (both to current and former aircraft) based on operational feedback from crews. Such changes included the enlarging of an internal fuel tank to increase the aircrafts range. Another included am aerodynamic revision of key rear fuselage surfaces in an effort to reduce airframe drag. The brake chute was relocated and a ram-air inlet was installed at the base of the tail fin. While early Su-24s sported variable intake ramps within their intake openings, this was later dropped to improve maintenance requirements and save on weight. The removal of these devices dropped the overall speed of the Su-24 from Mach 2.18 to Mach 1.35 - as devastating as this may have appeared, the expected low-level operations of the Su-24 suffered little in the move. The countermeasure capabilities of early Su-24s were progressively updated to include improved radar warning and missile launch warning coupled with integral onboard jamming equipment.\n\r\nThe Su-24 would not be formally accepted into service until February 6th, 1975. Her slab-sided fuselage eventually earned her the nickname of \"Suitcase\" from her crews. The West would not find out about the Su-24 until perhaps 1974 to which the incorrect designation of \"Su-19\" was assigned. Interestingly, this mistake would not be officially corrected until 1981. In true NATO fashion, the codename of \"Fencer\" was applied to the Su-24 - \"F\" being for \"Fighter\" (\"B\" was reserved for Bombers as in the \"Brewer\", \"Bear\", \"Bison\" etc...). It was not until the Soviet Air Force began arriving at East German air fields in 1979 did many of the fantastic Western estimates about the new Soviet aircraft finally dissolve.\n\nSu-24 Walk-Around\n\r\nThe Su-24's external design owed much to both the T6 prototypes as well as the Su-15 \"Flagon\" from which it was directly developed from. She sported a long oblong fuselage with flat surfaces along all her sides save for the upper surface. The cockpit was situated aft of the nose assembly housing the important radar suite. The operators (pilot and systems officer) sat in a side-by-side arrangement under a glass canopy featuring relatively light, unobtrusive framing. There was a forward canopy portion split at the center and a main canopy portion that opened as individual assemblies, each hinged along their respective rear frames. The pilot and his radar operator entered/exited the aircraft by way of individual \"clip-on\" ladders to the left and right sides of the forward fuselage. This was a necessity for the Su-24 sat a good distance from the surface of the tarmac - herself measuring some 20-feet, 4-inches in overall height. By any measure she proved a very large design when viewed up close. As in her prototype, the air intakes were mounted along the sides of the fuselage and sported rectangular openings to aspirate their respective turbojet engines buried further aft in the fuselage. Of note here was use of splitter plates to divert \"dead air\" away from the intake mouth and fuselage sides. Interestingly, the rounded curves of the forward fuselage quickly gave way to the true Soviet-style Cold War-era design of sharp angles and flat, featureless surfaces found further aft. The tricycle undercarriage remained largely unchanged from the prototypes.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-24 (Fencer)", "aircraft_type": "Long-Range Strike / Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "50e63f67-58d7-4064-8309-20a263ada3b2", "year_model": "1981", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the early 1980s, the Sukhoi Su-25 (NATO codename of \"Frogfoot\") has served the close-support air strike interests of the Soviet/Russian Air Force as well as the air forces of several nations around the world (primarily Soviet-allied countries or ex-Soviet states). The type has acquitted itself quite well through a plethora of combat exercises during her lengthy operational career. At her core, the Su-25 is  design comparable in battlefield role to the equally-storied Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack platform of the United States Air Force. Despite its decades-old origin, the Su-25 continues in a frontline operational role today (2012) and has been consistently - and adequately - modernized for the rigors and dangers of the modern battlefield. With her supporters still in place, the Su-25 should continue to bring a decade or more of faithful service for the near future as the horizon still lacks a viable replacement.\n\r\nThe Cold War spanned from the late 1940s into the late 1980s and covered a tension-filled portion of modern world history. The line was essentially drawn between the West - led by the United States and her European allies - and the East - headed by the Soviet Empire born from the upheaval of World War 1. The Soviet Union became a powerful military force during World War 2 thanks largely in part to Adolf Hitler's decision to invade the East, his forces finally being stalled by stretched supply lines and the Russian Winter within view of Moscow proper. The Soviet response was massive and brutal as manpower and machine were relocated through all manner of methods, eventually driving the German invaders back into Germany to which then the capital of Berlin was eventually claimed by the Soviet Army through bloody street-to-street fighting.\n\r\nThe events of World War 2 revealed a redesigned Europe where new nations  rose and old ones fell - many guided under various spheres of influence. The differences in ideology politics between East and West would eventually come to a head and, as it was appropriately believed that, the next large-scale war would be witnessed across Europe once again, this time involving thousands of modernized tanks and armored vehicles coupled with massive artillery barrages and air support. Additionally, nuclear weapons would come into play - both on the large scale and on the smaller, portable scale. \n\r\nAs such, both sides began development of dedicated anti-armor measures - heavily-armored and armed tanks, anti-tank missiles, field guns and aircraft. For the latter requirement, the Americans turned to Fairchild Republic which ended up producing the excellent A-10 Thunderbolt II, a twin-engined, jet-powered aircraft armed with a massive 30mm nose-mounted Gatling gun designed specifically to defeat Soviet armor from above. Additionally, the straight-winged nature of the vehicle promoted multiple weapon stations for fitting air-to-surface, armor-defeating guided missiles, rocket pods and drop bombs. The A-10 was a very well-armed machine and extensively armored for the low-level attack role with engines mounted in individual nacelles high above the fuselage to increase survivability. First flight was on May 10th, 1972 to which introduction of the system was finally granted in March of 1977. The United States Air Force became the primary (and sole) handler of the machine.\n\r\nThe Soviet response was similar in scope - a largely conventional, straight-winged design to be powered by turbojet engines and capable of delivering a broad array of munitions. Design was charged to the Sukhoi concern which had already totaled decades of experience in developing viable jet-powered aircraft for the Soviet Air Force (the other well-known Soviet concern being Mikoyan). The new requirement was written for an armored, ground-attack-minded aircraft intended to support ground forces in a combined arms initiative - particularly where enemy armor was in play. Key to the design would be its field survivability and weapons delivery while all other qualities could be deemed somewhat secondary in nature (primarily speed and agility).\n\r\nDevelopment of what would become the \"Su-25\" could be traced back to 1968 following various design studies culminating in the T-8-0 testbed. A working prototype did not officially fly until February 22nd, 1975 when the \"T-8-1\" pilot vehicle was sent airborne for the first time. The aircraft was outfitted with a pair of Tumansky RD-9B turbojet engines and further review led to many inevitable revisions to the product. The T-8-2 became the second true prototype while the T-8-2D mimicked much of what became the finalized Su-25 pre-production design. T-8-3 served as a developmental model. The first Soviet Air Force group stocking the new Su-25 was made operational in 1981 to which NATO recognized the aircraft as the \"Frogfoot\". Production of the Su-25 began in 1978 out of Factory 31 of Tbilisi, Georgia (then under the Soviet sphere).\n\r\nThe Su-25 was completed with a rather basic design approach. The cockpit was set to the front-end of the fuselage in the traditional sense with a clear canopy bordered by large window framing. The sole pilot sat in an titanium-armored \"tub\" that offered maximum protection from ground-based small arms and cannon fire. The aircraft was given a short, pointed nose-cone assembly and a rather stunted fuselage running length. The engines were mounted along the sides of the fuselage as opposed to a side-by-side internal arrangement so as to space them well apart, decreasing the likelihood of a dual-engine flameout or power loss resulting from a direct hit. The engines were aspirated by rounded-rectangular, side-mounted intakes aft of the cockpit and exhausted through circular openings along the sides of the empennage. base The empennage itself was traditional, consisting of a single vertical tail fin, a pair of horizontal tailplanes and a short \"stinger\" protruding from the base of the rudder. Wings were largely straight appendages in their overall design, exhibiting sweep only along the leading edge while being left mainly straight at the trailing edge. These assemblies would be called on to support all manner of munition options across multiple underwing hardpoints. Interestingly, the Su-25 utilized a unique wing-tip-mounted airbrake system that consisted of an upper and lower panel section hinged at the front of the wing. when actuated, the panels sprung open to quickly decrease the speed of the aircraft as required. The aircraft's engines were also a unique quality of the design in that they could be fed with standard aviation fuel as well as diesel, gasoline and kerosene in extreme circumstances. As the aircraft would also be called upon to operate from rough airfields, it proved good foresight to include external maintenance equipment pods which the Su-25 could carry from base-to-base on its own. As such, maintenance could be conducted on the aircraft without a full service outfit being present. The undercarriage was made up of two single-wheeled main landing gear legs and a single-wheeled nose leg, all retractable into the design to complete the aerodynamically refined shape of the aircraft.\n\r\nThe Su-25 featured a standard fixed armament of 1 x 30mm GSh-30-2 internal cannon supported through 250 rounds of ammunition. The underwing and underfuselage stations amounted 11 total hardpoints for the carrying of up to 9,700lbs of external ordnance. Munition options included short-range air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs, rocket pods, gun pods, guided air-to-surface missiles, cluster bombs and conventional drop bombs. At least two hardpoints are plumbed for external fuel stores.\n\r\nThe Su-25 saw extensive combat service in the Soviet involvement of in Afghanistan where their close-support functions could be put through their paces. Operational service in the theater led to beneficial upgrades and modifications of the base Su-25 which improved the type on the whole. As the Mujahedeen began relying more on American shoulder-launched Stinger surface-to-air missiles, the Su-25 was given dedicated survival measures such as IR suppressors over the engine exhaust rings and onboard chaff/flare dispensers to help scramble ground-based radar tracking and homing missile signals. The first Su-25s arrived in the theater in May of 1981 and, in all, some 50 Su-25 aircraft would be deployed during the war. The aircraft ultimately gave a good account of themselves while surviving heavy sortie loads for several years. Lack of progress in the conflict eventually led to a Soviet withdrawal in 1989 after nine years of bloody struggle.\n\r\nThe Su-25 went on to find many suitors in the war-minded world. Operators beyond the Soviet Union/Russia included Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Chad, Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Gambia, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, North Korea, Peru, Slovakia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n\r\nIran and Iraq fought one of the bloodiest wars of the 1980s through the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988. Iraq invaded Iran under the pretenses of upholding Islam and utilized its recently received stock of Soviet Su-25s by the end of the conflict. Several hundred sorties were handled by Iraqi Air Force aircraft in attacks against Iranian positions with one Su-25 credited lost to Iranian air defenses. Ironically, during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, at least seven Su-25s escaped coalition air strikes to Iran and were confiscated by Iranian authorities. Two additional Su-25s were lost to coalition fighters after being engaged by superior F-15 Eagles.\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991, the Russian Air Force retained the services of the Su-25, particularly during the tough years following shrinking defense budgets. This proved important for the aircraft line during the Russian wars of the new decade. Chechnya had proven a thorn in the side of of Russian authorities for quite some time due to the ongoing actions of separatists and this culminated in the \"First Chechen War\" of 1994, a conflict that would last until 1996. Su-25s were brought to bear against seemingly outmatched Chechen forces who utilized an effective guerilla-style ground campaign in turn. While air superiority was achieved by the Russian Air Force, the war ended with a Russian withdrawal of troops in the region and Chechen separatist claimed the victory (aided by foreign fighters, primarily Mujahideen). The war had proven very unpopular on the Russian front (which dwindled overall support) while Russian military moral was at a new low (consequences of a fallen superpower). This eventually forced the Russians to call a ceasefire. At least four Su-25 aircraft were lost in the conflict.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-25 Grach (Frogfoot)", "aircraft_type": "Close-Air Support (CAS) / Ground Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "c5c35ebf-d6db-4caf-b9b4-1d1af2797bcb", "year_model": "1985", "description": "\r\n        \tDesigned as a counter to the excellent American swing-wing Grumman F-14 \"Tomcat\" carrierborne fleet defender and the classic McDonnell Douglas F-15 \"Eagle\" air superiority fighter, the Soviet/Russian Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" became an instant classic when introduced into service during June of 1985. The twin-engined heavy platform evolved from its air superiority roots to become a complete multirole fighter during its lengthy time aloft. Even today the series continues as a frontline answer to the West's 4th Generation types and the line has evolved to include the related Su-30, Su-33 and Su-35 as well as several Chinese-originated offshoots. It is expected that the Su-27 family will maintain a presence over the modern battlefield for some decades more even as the in-development Sukhoi T-50 PAK-FA (detailed elsewhere on this site) makes its appearance in suitable numbers for the Russian Air Force.\n\nSu-27 Origins\n\r\nOrigins of the Su-27 place it back in the 1970s when the Soviet Air Force and Ministry of Aircraft Industry joined resources to study concepts for future Soviet fighter platforms. Multirole models were the call of the day - a single aircraft to accomplish various roles such as interception, air defense neutralization and ground attack. Air powers typically adopted two aircraft classes to meet the need - a medium-to-heavy  model alongside a lightweight performer. For the United States, this ultimately became the F-15/F14 paired with the General Dynamics F-16 \"Fighting Falcon\".\n\r\nFor the heavy-class fighter,  the Soviet focus fell to a design expected to showcase excellent performance and maneuverability despite its size while the lightweight aircraftlwent on to become the Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\". The heavy fighter force would account for over one-quarter of the Russian Air Force fleet, the lightweight development used to fill the rest of the stock - built along the lines of economic mass production and readily available to Soviet export allies around the world.\n\r\nCentral Research and Development Institute No. 30 pressed ahead and drew up plans for a new heavy fighter form, giving it a sleek, wing-body blending shape with twin vertical tail fins set atop and a twin engine arrangement. The wing-body arrangement provided the strength needed to carry large, heavy war loads and the twin engine configuration offered the necessary power and survivability needed of a high performance combat craft (should one engine be lost in combat, the aircraft held a better chance of returning home with the intact powerplant still in play). Situational awareness for the pilot was to be handled by an advanced onboard suite as well as a bubble-style canopy offering excellent all-around vision. Powerful scan-and-tracking radar would be fitted in the nosecone.\n\nSukhoi T10\n\r\nThe design was designated internally as \"T10\" and constituted the blended wing-body form (as the \"T10-1\") alongside a more conventional winged design (the \"T10-2\"). The latter design was dropped when it was deemed the advantages of the first offering were worth the risk and investment. With the design more or less fleshed out, power-players Sukhoi, Mikoyan and Yakovlev competed for the Ministry contract with a formal Air Force review coming in 1972. The Sukhoi design won out while Mikoyan was selected to fulfill the lightweight fighter requirement (producing the MiG-29). Engineering work continued on the T10 leading to many refinements until finalization was had by 1975. Construction on the flyable prototype was then begun.\n\r\nEngines used to power the fighter would come from Lyulka and they produced the AL-31F turbofan engine. With origins in the AL-21F-3 afterburning turbojet, the AL-31 series also offered afterburner capability and two of its kind would be used to power the Sukhoi prototype.\n\r\nShould the aircraft come to pass, the T10 would become the first Soviet aircraft to feature a true Fly-By-Wire (FBW) controlling with no mechanical linkage set between the control systems and the wing surface areas. Avionics would of course be state-of-the-art for the time and include a Head-Up Display (HUD) offering pertinent performance and mission information. A Fire Control Radar (FCR) and electro-optoelectronic targeting system would make the fighter a lethal adversary by assisting the pilot in all facets of targeting and engagement. Like the MiG-29, the Sukhoi T10 would also be fitted with an avionics suite largely digital in nature - another Soviet first for a combat aircraft.\n\r\nAll new missiles were also in development to round out the list of components necessary in bringing to life a frontline fighting machine to contend with anything the West could offer now and in the near future.\n\nDevelopment\n\r\nThe T10 prototype recorded its first flight on May 20th, 1977 and managed nearly forty flights into January of 1978 before ending its days as a museum showpiece. Early testing magnified aerodynamic issues that were appropriately dealt with. However, the program suffered a major setback when the second prototype was lost in a fatal crash on May 7th, 1978.\n\r\nThat same year, work began on construction of the third prototype which introduced outward-canted tailfins as well as being outfitted with the AL-31F series engines. This forced a major revision of the engine housings from intake to exhaust port to accommodate the powerplants. The aircraft was used as both an engine testbed and as a naval fighter prototype - completing ski-jump take-offs and being finished with arrestor gear and a reinforced undercarriage for the role. For 1983, a fourth prototype joined the stable for service as an avionics and weapons testbed. It claimed its first flight in October of 1979. A long range of prototypes then followed including high-speed, high-performance types intended for record-setting exercises. Even as the Su-27 entered serial production and frontline service, development continued on bettering the line.\n\nSu-27 Variants\n\r\nThe Su-27 managed a plethora of variants and designations throughout its flying career. The original prototype was the aforementioned \"T10\" (known to NATO as \"Flanker-A\") and T10S followed with an improved configuration mimicking production standard Flankers more closely. \"Su-27\" was used to mark pre-production vehicles with the AL-31 series engine. Rounded wingtips were a physical difference of early Su-27 aircraft.\n\r\nThe initial production-quality fighter became \"Su-27S\" (NATO codename of \"Flanker-B\") and these were single-seat fighters fitted with improved AL-31F engines, leading edge slats, and clipped wingtips. The vertical tail surfaces were moved further outboard as well. Su-27P became an air superiority / interceptor model lacking ground attack functionality, primarily issued to the Soviet Air Defense Forces. Su-27PU (to become the Su-30) evolved into a two-seat model based on the Su-27P interceptor - these carried equipment to help support older Soviet fighters then in service. The mark was later revised to become multirole platforms for export.\n\r\nSu-27UB became two-seat trainers (\"Flanker-C\") arriving in 1986 with a second cockpit for the instructor (at the expense of internal fuel and operating range). The Su-27S was exported as \"Su-27SK\" and the \"Su-27UB\" two-seat trainer was sold abroad as the \"Su-27UBK\". China evolved the Su-27SK as the Shenyang J-11 (detailed elsewhere on this site). Trainer forms retained all of their combat capability despite their primary role of flying classroom.\n\r\nThe Su-27SK variant was given an overall length of 72 feet, a wingspan of 48.2 feet and a height of 19.5 feet. Empty weight was 36,100 lb against a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 67,100 lb. Power is from 2 x Lyulka (Saturn) AL-31F turbofan engines developing 16,910 lb of dry thrust and 27,560 lb of thrust with afterburner engaged. Maximum speed reached Mach 2.35 or 1,550 miles per hour at altitude. Range is out to 2,200 miles and a service ceiling of 62,523 feet is reported. Rate-of-climb is listed at 59,000 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe Su-27SK carried a standard, fixed armament in the form of 1 x GSh-30-1 series internal cannon with 150 rounds afforded. Ten external hardpoints were in play capable of carrying up to 9,770 lb of stores for either Air-to-Air (AA) or Air-to-Surface (AS) sorties. A typical fighter/interceptor loadout became 6 x R-27 medium-range AA missiles with 2 x R-73 short-range AA missiles. Those Flankers equipped for ground attack had their armament load capabilities broadened considerably and carried anything from conventional drop stores and precision-guided munitions to guided missiles and rocket pods. Specialized mission forms were also forged, these equipped with anti-ship and anti-radar missiles.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-27 (Flanker)", "aircraft_type": "Air Superiority / Ground Attack / Multirole Fighter"}, {"id": "f421959e-120b-4e5f-8ee4-dedd6fa2a05c", "year_model": "1996", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-30 was initially developed as a further modification to the existing Su-27 \"Flanker\" series but ended as its own, all-new mark. The aircraft encompasses a multi-mission design frame based on the Su-27 though incorporated a second crewman (seated in tandem), improved datalinking and increased operational endurance. Production of this series model began in 1992 and is ongoing as of this writing (2017). Some 540 have been produced to date with operators (beyond Russia) now including Algeria, Angola, China, Belarus, India, Indonesia, Kazahkstan, Malaysia, Uganda, Venezuela and Vietnam - making this combat platform an important product in the Sukhoi fighter lineup.\n\r\nThe Su-27 family of large fighters makes up the backbone of the Russian Air Force and Navy Aviation fleets. It has proven itself to be a highly versatile, high performance combat platform that has wowed generations of onlookers at air shows and proven popular with former Soviet states and allies worldwide. Developments like the Su-30, Su-34 and Su-35 only serve to keep the line strong and the product a viable instrument over the modern battlefield.\n\r\nFrom development beginning in 1986, a first-flight in prototype form (based on the two-seat Su-27PU interceptor) was recorded on December 31st, 1989. However it was not until 1996 that the product was formally introduced into service for 1991 saw the formal end of the Soviet Empire of the Cold War (1947-1991).\n\r\nAt its core, the Su-30 represents a powerful evolution of the original Su-27 Flanker. It improves on the original's operational range and carries with it a refined air-to-air / air-to-surface all-weather attack quality. In this way, the same platform can be used to undertake both air space denial and ground strike missions as needed as it has a broadened support for various munitions types and its onboard systems can support both air and ground attacks. The general form and function of the Su-27 are retained but the mission set of the Su-30 is expanded considerably.\n\r\nPower is from 2 x Saturn AL-31F turbofan engines set within the lower body of the aircraft. These are fed through side-mounted intakes and exhausted at the rear as normal. Additionally the engines offer a reheat capability, better known as afterburner, which allows for short bursts of power and, therefore, short bursts of speed. The aircraft is capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.0 (1,300+ mph) out to a range (on internal fuel) of 1,850 miles. Its service ceiling is 56,800 feet and rate-of-climb is 56,800 feet-per-minute. Because of an integral refueling probe, the aircraft can expand its patrol range / mission endurance window up to 10 hours. Certain hardpoints under the aircraft are also plumbed for jettisonable fuel tanks. The second crewmember also alleviates crew fatigue on longer sorties.\n\r\nThe Su-30 carries the standard 30mm GSh-301 series automatic cannon and 150 projectiles are afforded it. Externally there are no fewer than twelve hardpoints and these support the full gamut of Russian munitions included air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles (including anti-ship and anti-radiation), rocket pods, general purpose conventional drop bombs and precision laser-guided bombs. The OEPS-27 forms the electro-optical targeting system of the aircraft. The nose houses a long-ranged phased-array Bars planar radar system.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-30 (Flanker-C)", "aircraft_type": "Two-Seat, Twin-Engine Air Superiority / Strike Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "496d23d0-1734-41e0-82a7-f129c49dae83", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-34 (NATO reporting name of \"Fullback\") is a dedicated Fourth Generation two-seat fighter-bomber/strike fighter platform based on the successful Su-27 \"Flanker\" air superiority fighter series for the Russian Air Force. The Flanker family of aircraft was born out of the Sukhoi Design Bureau in the 1970s and entered service in December of 1984, having since spawned into a handful of capable combat-minded roles including the Su-33 (\"Flanker-D\") navalized multi-role variant and the Su-35 long-range, air superiority/strike series (\"Flanker-E\"). While being largely based on the preceding Su-27 design (exported worldwide as the \"Su-30\") and incorporating some of its key qualities, the Su-34 is regarded as an all-new, independent aircraft design as it is heavily modified and intended for the strike role as primary with air superiority being a secondary quality of the design.\n\r\nThe Su-34 began life under the Sukhoi \"T-10V\" product designation, an initiative brought about by a 1980s Soviet Air Force requirement for a new, long endurance, high-speed tactical bomber intended to supersede the outgoing Sukhoi Su-24 \"Fencer\" series in the same role. The Sukhoi concern looked to its new Su-27 airframe as a possible starting point, the aircraft now beginning to take hold in useful numbers across the Soviet air inventory. The airframe was a excellent commodity and flexible enough to modify for the requirement, as proven through the promising - though ultimately abandoned - twin-seat T-10KM-2 navalized training aircraft once intended for the Soviet Navy. Sukhoi engineers felt comfortable with retaining much of the Su-27 arrangement with only a new forward fuselage added to the mix. As the Su-27 family of aircraft relied on a single-seat configuration, the fuselage was allowed a nice cylindrical design shape. However, for the new fighter-bomber endeavor, this would be modified through a new approach in which two pilots - seated side-by-side - would be added to a widened cockpit. To this, engineers then installed forward wing canards ahead of the main wing elements intended to improved stability and increase maneuverability. The Su-27's Lyulka series turbofan engines were uprated for greater power in the new Sukhoi initiative. The ultimate goal for the program was to develop a competent strike platform while retaining the excellent fighter qualities (handling and performance) of the Su-27 family. The Sukhoi program ultimately yielded the first T-10V-1 prototype form (born from an existing Su-27UB) which went airborne for the first time on April 13th, 1990. The T-10V designator was then dropped in favor of \"Su-27IB\" to indicate the type's new fighter-bomber role (\"Istrebeetel'-bombardirovschchik\"). The Su-27IB was first formally unveiled in 1992 and a second prototype followed, taking to the air on December 18th, 1993. By this time, the series was assigned the officially Russian Air Force designation of \"Su-34\" and further codenamed \"Fullback\" by NATO.\n\r\nThe most obvious design departure of the Su-34 when compared to the Su-27 was its larger cockpit cabin and forward fuselage assembly. The cockpit was deliberately designed as a large, comfortable operating space for the two crew and applicable systems. The area aft of the cockpit would feature a full in-flight galley and lavatory to help offset the fatigue and physical stresses undertaken by the crew over long sorties - the crew can stand or lay down as needed. The crew was made up of a primary pilot and his weapons operator, seated in a side-by-side arrangement (as in the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark fighter-bomber). The use of two crew allowed the mission workload to be spread about, lessening crew fatigue (and inherent mistakes) while a consistently pressurized cockpit allowed for a working environment not requiring cumbersome oxygen masks to be worn. The resulting Sukhoi aircraft retained the wings, tail unit, fixed intake engine nacelles and aft-fuselage of the original Su-27, incorporating the new forward fuselage and a modified rear \"stinger\" housing a rear-facing/scanning radar array. The Su-34 makes use of the prominent rearward-looking radar system housed in a \"stinger\" at the rear of the fuselage to counter any approaching enemy threats in pursuit of the aircraft. The undercarriage consists of two main landing gear legs and a nose leg, the former outfitted with a pair of inline wheels to offset the added weight of the new design while the latter makes use of a dual-wheel, side-by-side arrangement. These were different from the simpler configuration of the Su-27.\n\r\nThe Su-34's cockpit is a modern, all-glass effort dominated by CRT displays and sporting the latest in Russian avionics technology as well as digital processing systems. Views from within the cockpit are relatively good thanks to the large clear canopy with only a forward frame splitting the frontal view - though the raised fuselage spine (required for larger internal volume) defeats any rearward visibility for the crew. The cockpit's noticeable duck-bill type design approach features a pronounced \"nose-down\" appearance which aids the crew in taxiing actions and landing of the aircraft. Onboard systems propel the Su-34 (and the Russian Air Force for that matter) into the modern age and feature real-time digital battlefield management systems, advanced targeting and tracking options and a vastly improved navigation suite over previous Russian attempts. Onboard automation extends the overall value of the aircraft by allowing the crew to concentrate on other facets of the mission at hand - engine status, crew health and scanning/incoming threats can all be handled by the aircraft - autopilot is truly autonomous requiring only directional input, the aircraft capable of guiding itself to a point. The crew (as well as engine intakes and internal fuselage fuel cells) are armored for protection against enemy ground fire when in the low-level attack role. Each operator is also afforded the typical Russian helmet-mounted sight and ejection seating. HUD  (Head-Up Display) is present and stealth features have been subtly incorporated throughout the airframe (including use of a radar-absorbing skin coat) - though the Su-34 remains a largely conventional Fourth Generation aircraft design and not a true stealth design (as in the now-retired F-117 Nighthawk).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-34 (Fullback)", "aircraft_type": "Fighter-Bomber / Long Range Strike Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "f86d900d-2a2f-4719-b091-4ba8b7dae2e4", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-35 (NATO: \"Flanker-E\") is the latest (2013) variant of the successful Su-27 \"Flanker\" family of air superiority aircraft. The original Su-27 was born in a late 1970s Soviet Air Force initiative to counter the American McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle air superiority mount.  Since then, the type's tactical value has broadened considerably in the ground attack role and the line has even spawned the navy-centric carrier-based Su-33. The Su-35 is marketed as a true 4th/4.5th Generation multi-role performer built upon the strong and proven qualities of the Su-27 line - retaining its air-to-air prowess while incorporating advanced ground attack features. The Su-35 emerged from the modified Su-27M developmental series to which the finalized \"Su-35\" designation came about in 1993 though the aircraft was already publicly displayed by the time of the 1992 Farnborough Air Show. Ten total prototypes of the Su-35 were then built, four being conversions from existing Su-27s while the rest being new-build aircraft beginning official Russian evaluation in 1996. The Su-35 differs from the original Su-27 in its inherent multi-role capabilities, highly modernized avionics (including the new Tikhomirov NIIP Irbis phased antenna array), long range endurance, thrust vectoring (and new) NPO Saturn 117S engines and streamlined aerodynamic qualities. First flight was recorded in June of 1998 and, after an extended period of testing, formally entered production after adoption by the Russian Air Force as the \"Su-35S\" in 2010. \n\r\nThe aircraft features an integrated in-flight refueling probe, provision for ECM (Electronic CounterMeasure) pods, upgraded and more powerful engines, larger wing surface areas and a forward and rear-facing Phazotron radar system capable of simultaneous tracking of 24 targets up to 62 miles (100km) away over uneven terrain. An additional auxiliary internal reserve fuel tank has been added as well to bring about the require operational range. The cockpit sports an updated color CRT display as well as HUD (Head-Up Display) along with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) capability with quadruple redundancy - the onboard computers able to to find four different ways to achieve the desired flight control action. Avionics include an Irbis-E passive phased array radar system. The advanced nature of the Su-35 nets it the formal classification of \"4th Generation Fighter\" - though its true capabilities go well beyond the original/current crop of 4th Generation mounts while falling short of the standard adopted for true 5th Generation mount (such as the American Lockheed F-22 Raptor series).\n\r\nOutwardly, the Su-35 retains much of the clean sleek lines of the Su-27. It is a noticeably large aircraft with well-swept wings, a long running forward fuselage and side-by-side engine layout. The Su-35 makes use of a nose cone to house its powerful tracking radar system. Twin vertical tails, each sitting atop the engine installations, are fitted aft on the fuselage in the usual way. Cockpit visibility is excellent for a machine of this class. The engines exhaust through thrust vectoring rings at the extreme aft section of the fuselage, providing excellent maneuverability and allowing the Su-35 to complete moves off limits to other 4th Generation mounts. The Su-35 also features the Flanker-style stinger at the tail - an extended portion of fuselage housing a rear-looking radar facility.\n\r\nDepending on production mark, power is provided by 2 x Saturn 1117S afterburning turbofan engines with the aforementioned thrust vector control. The engines output at 32,000lb thrust each on full thrust and roughly 19,400lb each on dry thrust alone. The thrust vectoring system allows for excellent agility when compared to the conventional Su-27 mount, the aircraft able to make tighter turns for evasion in a close-range dogfight or for out maneuvering incoming homing/guided missiles (the Russians have adopted an agile-minded approach to modern dogfighting unlike the speed/stealth-minded approach of the West). The Su-35S lists a top speed of Mach 2.25 at altitude, roughly 1,500 miles per hour and range, on internal fuel, is out to 1,900 nautical miles while Su-35S can ferry out to 2,400 nautical miles. The Su-35S will have the capability to operate at service ceilings of 60,000 feet and sport a 55,100 feet-per-minute climb rate.\n\r\nAs a multi-role fighter platform, the Su-35S benefits from the full array of Russian-sponsored ordnance options across no fewer than 14 weapon hardpoints, 12 underwing and under-fuselage - all external. A 30mm GSh-30 internal cannon is standard for close-in fighting (150 projectiles allocated) while the wingtips are reserved for the R-73 (AA-11 \"Archer\") short-range air-to-air missile. Additionally, the wingtip rails can be removed and replaced with specialized ECM pods as mission parameters dictate. The remaining hardpoints will be home to various air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, anti-radiation missiles, anti-ship missiles, laser-guided bombs, guided rocket pods, unguided rocket pods, and precision weapons as needed.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-35 (Flanker-E / Super Flanker)", "aircraft_type": "Multirole Heavy Combat Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "694717e2-cb3a-42cc-99e0-f5cb6ceb3d3f", "year_model": "1967", "description": "\r\n        \tTo service local, regional and international passenger and freight travel during the Cold War period (1947-1991), Soviet aero industry was forced to develop internal solutions to meet the demand. One product of the time became the Tu-134, known to NATO under the codename of \"Crusty\", which has operated for decades since its introduction in 1967. The type went on to see considerable service in both military and civilian roles, such was its versatility, with examples still in active service today (2018) with a few users. At peak usage, the Tu-134 could claim many operators in some forty-plus countries worldwide.\n\r\nThe Tu-134's development was spurred by the French advancement of relocating an aircraft's primary propulsion away from wing mainplanes and onto the aft section of the fuselage. This had an effect on two key qualities of a passenger-minded aircraft - it reduced cabin noise by keeping the engines further away from the passenger center and it reduced over-under drag at the wing mainplanes. Large Soviet airplane-maker, Tupolev - primarily recognized for their contributions to the military bomber category, was commissioned by the Soviet government to produce a similar design to the ground-breaking Sud Aviation \"Caravelle\" and thus began the story of the Tu-134. The new aircraft would be used to begin succeeding the line of aged and outdated prop-driven passenger types then in Soviet service with its primary market being short-ranged routes across the Soviet sphere of influence - including East Germany.\n\r\nTupolev responded with a prototype form, the Tu-124A, that first-flew on July 29th, 1963. The aircraft carried swept planes at both the main and tail members. The engines were mounted on short wing stubs located along the aft-end of the fuselage and the mainplanes (swept back at some 35-degree angles) were low-mounted at midships. The cockpit was set aft of a short nosecone in the usual way (with side-by-side seating for its two pilots) and the aircraft was given a \"T-style\" tail arrangement which set the horizontal planes high about its design while the support structure was the vertical fin itself. A tricycle undercarriage was used for ground-running and, interestingly enough, a brake parachute was used to retard the aircraft's run down the runway upon landing (this was later succeeded by more conventional thrust reversers when these were added to the D-30 engines in future models). The nose section was originally glazed over for the navigator's position but later covered over as the series matured to include radar.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-134 (Crusty)", "aircraft_type": "Passenger Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "84e8b9b7-e0df-45f0-bcca-dd47ed6698b2", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tupolev Tu-143 (Reys) was developed as a dimensionally-smaller, low-to-medium-altitude, short-ranged version of the preceding Tu-141 reconnaissance drone (detailed elsewhere on this site) by the Soviet Union's Tupolev OKB concern. The newer version achieved its first-flight in 1970 and was brought online in 1976 - though not officially introduced into service until 1982. The series - of which some 950 were eventually produced - went on to stock the inventories of the usual Soviet-allied players of the time including Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia (eventually passed on to Slovakia), Iraq, Romania, and Slovakia. \n\r\nDespite its Cold War-era origins, the Tu-143 still manages to serve with the powers of Belarus, North Korea, Russia (reserved as aerial targets), Syria, and Ukraine today (2022) though it is considered an obsolete design as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) go.\n\r\nBorrowing design lines from the earlier Tu-141, the Tu-143 was essentially \"missile-like\" in its general appearance with the exception of a turbojet engine seated over the aft section of the fuselage dorsal line. Mainplanes were added low, and to the sides, of the aft-section of the fuselage while small canard-like foreplanes are set along the sides of the fuselage aft of the nose. The nosecone was capped by a noticeable a probe protrusion. As the aircraft lacked a conventional undercarriage, a launch vehicle (encompassing the Tu-143's own transport tube) was used in the take-off process which also involved Jet-Assisted Take-Off (JATO) from the launch rail (the booster pack seated under the aft-section of the fuselage) with recovery handled by parachute deployed at mission's end.\n\r\nDimensionally, the T-143 was given an overall length of 26.4 feet, a wingspan of 7.3 feet, and a height of 5 feet. Its launch weight reached 2,710lb and power form the single Klimov TR3-117 turbojet of 1,300lb thrust provided the vehicle with a maximum speed of 590 miles-per-hour. The vehicle's rated service ceiling was 16,500 feet and its range was 125 miles.\n\r\nSeveral notable variants in the Tu-143 family line ultimately emerged beginning with the M-143 of 1983 which was a dedicated target drone. The Tu-243, first flying in 1987, was then offered in 1999 as an improved version for reconnaissance work: its fuselage was lengthened by 10 inches to accommodate additional fuel storage to enhanced operational ranges while the internal guidance system was improved and a more powerful Klimov TR3-117 series engine outputting 1,410 lb thrust was installed.\n\r\nFrom this work came the announcement that an all-new, more powerful model was in development, the Tu-300 \"Korshun\". This offering was to provide much-needed support for more modern sensors and feature munitions-delivery support. With the fall of the Soviet Empire in the late-1980s / early-1990s, this project struggled to gain footing and was not revitalized until 2007 - though its current development status is unknown.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-143 (Reys / Flight)", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance Drone"}, {"id": "65df7abb-89c7-4003-a733-0d3123325a1a", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tupolev concern of Russia holds an aviation history dating as far back as 1926, having since established a name in large military and commercial aircraft designs. To supply the latter with a new medium-ranged hauler (replacing several outgoing turboprop models), Tupolev assumed a three-turbofan-engined, low monoplane wing design comparable to Western offerings of the time. The three engines were held in the aft-section of the fuselage, a configuration popular during the 1960s and 1970s, and design work on the type preceded its first flight, this recorded on October 4th, 1968. After passing trials and gaining the required certifications, the new design emerged as the Tu-154 with production beginning in 1968 and spanning until 2011. Deliveries from Tupolev to awaiting carriers began in 1970 to which formal introduction was in 1972, this with Aeroflot. 1,025 examples were ultimately produced and this breed stocked some 21 airlines during her operational tenure. Today, roughly 100 are still flying, impressive considering the type's inception over 40 years ago. Upon recognition from the West, NATO observers christened the aircraft the \"Careless\".\n\r\nUnlike Western airliner types, the Tu-154 was specifically designed for very rigorous conditions and for navigating the broad and unforgiving airspaces common to the then-Soviet frontier. The undercarriage was reinforced for operations from rough airfields while the body was developed to content with freezing conditions of the north. Since maintenance facilities in more rural areas of the country would offer little to no service for the aircraft, the Tu-154 was designed to operate for long periods of time before requiring a scheduled overhaul. Such stresses undoubtedly caused several of the 39 published accidents involving the Tu-154 series during its service life. Other factors usually centered around pilot/crew errors and accidents.\n\r\nDesign of the Tu-154 was conventional with a slim, tubular fuselage, forward-set cockpit, low-mounted swept main wing assemblies and a high-mounted Tee-style tailplane atop a vertical fin. All three engines were concentrated to the rear of the design with two straddling the vertical fin and the third buried at its frontal base (running from the fuselage spine). The sides of the fuselage were appropriately dotted with rectangular windows for passenger viewing. There were four rectangular access doors to either fuselage side for quick embarking/disembarking of passengers. Cargo was stored in the deck beneath the passenger seating area. The flight crew sat well-forward in the design with good views over the nose through a framed window set. The vehicle traveled along the ground view a tricycle undercarriage that consisted of two main landing gear legs and a nose leg. The main legs were of note for their multi-wheeled design, wheels numbering six in all. The nose leg was conventional with a two wheel set. Internally. the Tu-154 was arranged to carry approximately 164 passengers. Outwardly, the Tu-154 was highly comparable to the American Boeing 727 series and the British Hawker Siddeley Trident models - both appearing prior to the Tupolev design.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-154 (Careless)", "aircraft_type": "Commercial Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "eb887505-ca51-4adf-a04d-1c88dd85998f", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tSince its inception, the Tupolev-produced Tu-160 (NATO codename of \"Blackjack\", nicknamed in Russia/Soviet Union as the \"White Swan\") has been the largest jet-powered, swing-wing combat aircraft platform ever produced, mounting the most powerful jet engines fitted to any military aircraft. Developed as a direct counter-product to the United States Air Force's Rockwell B-1 \"Lancer\" strategic bomber, the Tu-160 was designed to fulfill the slightly different role of stand-off missile launching. In contrast, the B-1 served primarily to deliver of large amounts of precision munitions in the form of cruise missiles and other potent air-to-surface types. The Tupolev system, though having mostly fallen to general neglect and under-use since the close of the Cold War, has received some recent attention as Russia strives to regain her former military glory. Though looking every bit a direct copy of the B-1 bomber, the Tu-160 is in fact many times larger than her American counterpart - though no less lethal - and sports better range and a larger munitions capability.\n\r\nOrigins of the Tu-160 date as far back as the United States North American XB-70 Valkyrie supersonic, long-range Mach 3.0-capable bomber project. The USAF project was a promising venture and two prototypes were eventually built and tested. One was tragically lost to an in-flight accident with a chase plane and the entire program was eventually cancelled. In 1967, half-a-world-away, the Soviet Union herself was beginning to move on a similar program. The agreed requirement came down for a supersonic bomber capable of Mach 3 speed. Similarly to the XB-70 program, the Soviet attempt was far-reaching and much less fruitful, the general realization being that such a system was beyond reach of becoming an effective solution.\n\r\nAs a result, product requirements were scaled back and, in 1972, a new Soviet attempt was launched for a like-minded system within a shorter scope. This airframe would make use of variable-geometry wings and reach supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2.3. The new product was to match wits with the equally-new Rockwell B-1A Lancer strategic bomber gaining steam in the United States. Tupolev, under the direction of V. I. Bliznuk, delivered their supersonic Tu-144-inspired \"Aircraft 160M\" large-scale bomber design into the fold and the Blackjack legacy was more-or-less born. Tupolev's design competed against a Sukhoi T-4 and Myasishchev M-18 offering and, while the Myasishchev product was generally accepted as the \"winning\" design, the Tupolev firm was elected in 1973 to head its development based on their successful history and overall potential in approaching the new Soviet bomber initiative.\n\r\nThough development of the B-1A Lancer was stopped (for a time) in 1977, development of the Tu-160 continued until production resulted in about 30 such examples - with roughly 19 of these resided in the Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union. Eight of these were later transferred back to Russian hands in a debt-relief agreement at the beginning of 2000. It is suspect as to whether Ukraine maintains the military infrastructure to field their remaining Tu-160s. Some sources also stated that Ukraine lent or sold up to three non-military Tu-160 examples to the United States to be used as \"satellite-launching platforms\". Interesting in that the United States generally launches any satellite by way of Titan rockets.\n\r\nIn all, the Tu-160 family includes a variety of forms, some produced in quantity and others reserved for experimentation. The Tu-160S was used to designation serial production Tu-160s and define experimental versions from their pre-production counterparts. The Tu-160M is a modernized, lengthened version fielding two Kh-90 hypersonic (beyond Mach 5.0) long range missiles. The Tu-160P was a long-range version while the Tu-160PP was a dedicated Electronic Warfare Aircraft (EWA) platform fitted with Electronic CounterMeasures gear. The Tu-160R was a true strategic reconnaissance product. The Tu-160SK served in a \"commercial\" format, utilized as a satellite-launching platform. The Tu-170 was a designation used for conventional bomber Tu-160s in an effort to skirt the SALT-2 treaty limitations.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-160 (Blackjack)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Long-Range Heavy Supersonic Bomber Aircraft"}, {"id": "5b5f9213-d5ee-4053-8da4-c8a74ff449c4", "year_model": "1995", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tu-204 is a narrow-body, twin-engine passenger airliner developed by Tupolev OKB of Russia at the tail-end of the Soviet Empire's reign and introduced in the period thereafter with air carrier Aeroflot. The type has mainly proven popular with former Soviet-aligned nations including China, Cuba, Egypt, and North Korea who have purchased the series in limited numbers when compared to Western counterparts of same class and role. Fewer than 100 airframes have been delivered despite a series introduction had in 1996 and no one year has resulted in more than ten airframes being completed.\n\r\nIts prototype flew for the first time on January 2nd, 1989, some thirty-plus years ago. The aircraft is broadly comparable to the American Boeing Model 757 twin-engined airliner detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the Tu-204 aircraft is conventional: the cockpit/flight deck is positioned over and aft the short nosecone assembly. The fuselage is tubular and lined with oval vision ports while the tail incorporates a single rudder fin with low-mounted, all-moving horizontal planes. The mainplanes are low-mounted along the fuselage sides, swept-back for aerodynamic efficiency, and positioned near midships. Each member supports a single nacelle engine component which is slung under the wings. More modern incarnations of the aircraft also sport winglets for added stability and enhanced fuel economy. A retractable tricycle undercarriage is used for ground-running and is made up of double-bogied main legs and a single-bogied nose leg.\n\r\nInternally, the typical cabin arrangement is of single-aisle with three seats to a fuselage side. As a multi-role airframe, however, the internals can be completely reworked to accept cargo loads for long-haul transport sorties. In the cockpit, the flight crew sits side-by-side with control columns and rudder pedals duplicated as expected. The throttle quadrant is on a shared center console and various controls are positioned in an overhead set up. More modern variants of the line naturally have more modern cockpits complete with color displays and a more minimal instrument panel arrangement as a whole.\n\r\nThe original production airliner was the \"Tu-204\" and the freighter version became the \"Tu-204C\" (to include the \"Tu-240-100C\" and the \"Tu-240-120C\" marks). The \"Tu-204-100\" of 1995 switched to the (Aviadvigatel) PS90 turbofan engine of 35,300lb thrust. Its longer-ranged counterpart became the \"Tu-204-200\". Today, the mark is produced under the \"Tu-214\" designation.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-204-120\", \"Tu-204-220\", \"Tu-204-120C\", and \"Tu-204-220C\" have all been offered with foreign avionics and engine fits in an effort to expand the product line in Western-leaning markets.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-204-300\" (\"Tu-234\") was given a shortened fuselage with enhanced operational ranges. The \"Tu-204-500\" is a dedicated short-ranged hauler that's faster with smaller-area mainplanes.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-204SM\" (\"Tu-204CM\") fulfills the medium-haul market requirement and is formed from the earlier Tu-204-100/300 series.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-206\" is a proposed private-venture testbed.\n\r\nThe related, heavier, and longer-ranged \"Tu-214\" was born from the Tu-204-200 and is manufactured outside of Tupolev facilities, primarily with Aviastar-SP and Kazan Aircraft Production Association. Various sub-marks of this model have been produced including special-mission governmental and military types.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-204", "aircraft_type": "Narrow-Body Passenger Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "a8f8c10d-c700-4974-a8cf-09ddded6d842", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tupolev Tu22M \"Backfire\" was/is a dedicated strategic bombing and maritime strike platform primarily serving Soviet interests (both during the Cold War and even today). The Tu-22M represented a further evolution of the original Tu-22 \"Blinder\" which failed to impress along many lines. However, the Tu-22M incorporated enough major changes that it could be considered an \"all-new\" bomber aircraft and brought about improved use of missile armament and supersonic flight as well as introducing variable geometry wings.\n\r\nWhile the original supersonic Tupolev Tu-22 \"Blinder\" medium bomber failed to live to its expectations in replacing the aging Tu-16 \"Badger\" series, work inevitably began on a \"variable-geometry\" of the same aircraft. Variable geometry wings were being researched as early as the 1930s and it was the Germans who made good progress on the subject in World War 2. The technology was furthered during the Cold War with the (arguably) best example of this type of aircraft being the American Grumman F-14 Tomcat carrier-based interceptor. Other aircraft to incorporate this technology ultimately included the Rockwell B-1 \"Lancer\", the General Dynamics F-111 \"Aardvark\", the MiG-23/MiG-27 \"Flogger\", the Panavia \"Tornado\" and the Tupolev Tu-160 \"Blackjack\". The evolution planned for the Tu-22 was nothing new to Soviet avionics for the Sukhoi Su-7 \"Fitter\" began life as a fixed-wing fighter aircraft onto to become the swing-wing Su-17/Su-20/Su-22 family of fighter bombers a short time later.\n\r\nWhat the original Tu-22 design lacked was inherently poor handling. She proved technologically complex and require high maintenance levels with poor turn-around times. She was a complex beast and, to add insult to injury, proved limited in a performance sense - the Tu-22 actually failed to improve upon the qualities of the subsonic Tu-16 in many respects, essentially labeling itself a disappointment overall. Production of the type totaled just 311 aircraft. The implementation of variable geometry wings would allow the \"new\" aircraft the ability to adjust its wing planform inflight, in direct response to changing speeds and airflow, providing stability at low and high speeds. The Tupolev concern toyed with the idea of fitting their Tu-22 with swing-wings as early as 1962 and design work on such an airframe began as early as 1962. Ultimately, the firm produced the \"Samolyot 145\" prototype to test the idea in a practical sense and a formal prototype then emerged as the \"Tu-22M0\" which took to the air for the first time on August 30th, 1968. After a short evaluation period, the \"Tu-22M\" was formally adopted for service in the Soviet Air Force. When NATO observers identified the plane as unique (this in September of 1969), it was assigned the incorrect designation of \"Tu-26\" with the codename of \"Backfire\", Western observers believing that the Tu-22M was, in fact, an all-new aircraft in the traditional sense. The initial production mark (Tu-22M1) therefore became the \"Backfire-A\". \n\r\nThe Tu-22M pre-production form was limited to just nine examples while the early Tu-22M1 was produced in another nine examples in 1971. The first truly \"definitive\" production form therefore became the Tu-22M2 (\"Backfire-B\") with its NK-22 series turbofan engines. The upcoming Tu-22M3 was given improved NK-25 turbofans and was known under the NATO codename of \"Backfire-C\" which went online in 1983 (first flying in 1976). A new nav/attack radar was introduced as were other refinements. A rotary missile launcher was installed in the bomb bay and overall performance specifications were improved to an extent. All Tu-22M-capable Tu-22M production models were then upgraded to the more modern Tu-22ME standard. The Tu-22M3 itself was upgraded to the Tu-22M3M mark with new avionics and provision for guided munitions dispensing. Tu-22M2 versions fitted with NK-23 engines were known as Tu-22M2Ye.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-22M (Backfire)", "aircraft_type": "Swing-Wing Supersonic Strategic / Maritime Bomber"}, {"id": "b4f1752a-9429-4835-8de9-6b92e09012bc", "year_model": "1956", "description": "\r\n        \tFollowing the developmental Tupolev Tu-80 and Tu-85 programs was the famous Tupolev Tu-95 \"Bear\" which proved a common site in the skies over the Pacific and elsewhere during the Cold War decades. The aircraft owed much to the two preceding developmental designs, both of which were cancelled after just prototypes were completed and evaluated though all could trace their lineage back to the Tupolev Tu-4 \"Bull\". While the Tu-4 was produced under the Soviet Tupolev brand label, it was nothing more than an unlicensed copy of the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress of which three was force-landed on Soviet soil and confiscated during World War 2 (1939-1945) following raids on Japan. The B-29 offered Soviet engineers the necessary data on producing long-range heavy bomber types which were then lacking in the Soviet air arm amidst growing concern over the American reach and its nuclear program. The Tu-80 utilized conventional propeller-driven power which ultimately lacked the qualities desired when compared to the promising Tu-85 and its reciprocating engines. However, both eventually lost out to the turboprop-powered \"Tu-95\" development which went on to have a very healthy service life that continues even today (December 2013).\n\r\nThe decision to move towards the turboprop form over a turbojet configuration promised better endurance as jets still proved fuel-hungry propulsion systems. The offer for a new, swept-wing ,jet-powered strategic bomber initially fell to the competing concern of Myasishchev who sold the Soviet military on the idea of a 590 mile per hour bomber with 8,070 mile range. No to be outdone, engineers at Tupolev went hard at work on a competing type and this was initially based on captured war-time plans from Germany for a swept-wing , jet-powered bomber. The Myasishchev design was eventually adopted as the jet-powered, swept-wing M-4 \"Bison\" but Tupolev persisted in its own design goal nonetheless, and influenced, in part, by its existing large-body aircraft programs in the Tu-4 and Tu-85. Swept-wing design experience would be forged through the existing Tu-16 \"Badger\" and Tu-88 products.\n\r\nTwo Tupolev design forms then became apparent: one was a four-engined jet development competing against a four-engined turboprop variant. While logic of the time favored the jet, Tupolev was sold on the range of the turboprop approach with its propeller-driven configuration. The technology for this was formed through the captured German Junkers Jumo 022 system. By this time, the Tupolev product was granted the working designation of \"Aircraft 95\" - better known as the \"Tu-95\" - and offered official support from the government though, on several occasions, Tupolev owner A.N. Tupolev himself had to fight governmental hierarchy to keep his Tu-95 project alive - authorities still favoring a jet-powered design form.\n\r\nFirst flight of a Tu-95 prototype was finally recorded on November 12th, 1952. The design exhibited a lengthy, tubular-yet-squat fuselage with wide-spanning, high-mounted, swept-back wings. Each wing managed a pair of turboprops in long nacelles found at the leading edges. These turboprops drove two four-bladed propellers in a contra-rotating fashion. The cockpit was stepped and sported heavy framing though all four engines could be clearly seen from the seat positions. The nose was glazed for the bomber crew. The fuselage tapered slight to form the empennage to which a single, high-reaching vertical tail fin was mounted along with low-set, swept-back horizontal tail planes. The undercarriage was fully-retractable and of the tricycle configurations - this traced back to the original Boeing B-29 approach. The prototype was recognized internally at Tupolev as the \"Tu-95-1\" and power was served through 4 x Kuznetsov 2TV-2F coupled turboprops. Standard armament included 1 or 2 x 23mm AM-23 radar-controlled cannons in the tail - a common fixture of large Soviet bombers of the period. The bomb-carrying capacity reached nearly 20,000lbs and eventually would include support for missiles.\n\r\nWith the program proceeding, the gearbox ultimately delivered trouble during testing and this led to the loss of prototype 95-1 when engine No. 3 caught fire in flight. It eventually broke free of its mounting and caused the aircraft to crash, amazingly killing only four of its eleven crew on May 17th, 1953. This particular event steered the design team away from the original Kuznetsov engines and towards the Kuznetsov NK-12 series instead. This move begat the \"Tu-95-2\" prototype.\n\r\nAfter passing all of the requisite testing and evaluations, the Tu-95 was officially adopted for service in the Soviet military with production spanning from 1952 to 1994. Some 500 units would be built in all with formal introduction of the aircraft occurring in 1956. The aircraft carried the NATO codename of \"Bear\" once properly identified.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-95 (Bear)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Reconnaissance / Heavy Bomber Aircraft"}, {"id": "a0c7df98-c7d1-4a9f-80b7-432efa2b1b93", "year_model": "2005", "description": "\r\n        \tIn recent years, Russian defense forces have been adopting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in greater numbers. One type in having made its way into the inventory of the Russian Air Force is the compact Yakovlev \"Pchela\" (\"Bee\") which is used for the Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance (ISR) role. The system is used by the militaries of both Russia and North Korea (2018). A first-flight was recorded in 1990.\n\r\nThe vehicle's design consists of a tube-like fuselage which houses the optics and avionics set in the front and the powerpack in the rear. The optics are held in a traversing \"blister\" mounted in the chin position and integrates real-time video feeds with protected data-link capability - giving ground commanders access to real-time battlefield data. The engine drives a shrouded propeller unit in \"pusher\" configuration at the tail. Over midships is a shoulder-mounted, straight wing mainplane. The undercarriage is a static, shock-absorbing four-legged tube assembly.\n\r\nAs designed, the air vehicle has a an operational range out to about 40 miles from its ground remote-control post and can reach altitudes in excess of 8,000 feet. Maximum speed reaches over 110 mph. The system can remain airborne for some two total hours. The launch process requires use of two solid-propellant booster rocket-driven engines and recovery is by way of a parachute deployed to retard the fall of the vehicle as it returns to the ground. The vehicle is flown either through pre-set mission waypoints (automated flight) or by remote, manual input by a ground-based operator.\n\r\nBeyond its stated value to the ISR role, the Pchela can also be used to designate targets for accompanying attack aircraft and can further serve as a target drone for training actions. Like other UAVs of this class, the Pchela is designed with a modular payload-carrying capability which can be arranged to suit the needs of the customer.\n\r\nAccording to Yakovlev marketing materials, the complete Pchela field system includes up to ten air vehicles with associated (dispensable) booster launchers, the mobile GCS and launch rail (built into the compact tracked, air-droppable BTR-D armored vehicle), a supporting URAL-4320 military truck, and a loader-transporter GAZ-66 series military truck.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Pchela (Bee)", "aircraft_type": "ISR Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)"}, {"id": "a0d54bbd-7afe-4f88-b467-aac23e854b6c", "year_model": "2010", "description": "\r\n        \tAdvanced jet-powered trainers with secondary strike roles are becoming an ever more growing presence on the modern battlefield due to their initial procurement costs (this usually in some great number), long-term maintenance costs and inherent dual-role functionality. Such aircraft allow a potential operator the ability to train all-new generations of airmen while maintaining a limited attack capability in their fleet of lightweight systems - making them highly appealing to budget-concious interested parties. The Yak-130 (NATO: \"Mitten\") is Yakovlev's entry into the crowded field, bringing with it a strong company lineage dating back to 1934 and modern-minded modular capabilities that have primarily garnered it the interest of the Russian Air Force to date. Irkut Corporation handles manufacture of the Yak-130 though an export-minded derivative for Western clients is also being developed as the M-346 \"Master\" under the Alenia Aermacchi brand label of Italy.\n\r\nOne of the key qualities of aircraft systems like the relatively new Yak-130 is the ability to recreate the operating environment and handling of modern fighting jets. For the Russian Air Force, this also includes mimicking the qualities of their upcoming Sukhoi T-50 PAK FA 5th Generation high-performance stealth fighter as well as current 4th Generation mounts already in inventory. The PAK FA stealth fighter is a direct competitor to the American F-22 Raptor and only one of a now-growing number of such aircraft in the world. Similarly, the Chinese are working on their Chengdu J-20 twin engine initiative.\n\r\nDesign of the Yak-130 is highly conventional for aircraft of this class yet wholly modern. The fuselage is well-contoured for the high-performance role, featuring a pointed beak-like nose cone assembly, forward-set cockpit and dual-engine layout. In two-seat versions of the aircraft, the pilots sit in tandem with the student (primary) pilot in the front cockpit and the instructor (secondary) pilot in the rear cockpit. Both benefit from the aircraft's use of a large unobstructed canopy which rewards with excellent vision to all regions of the aircraft save for the slightly blocked rear view due to the fuselage's spine. The wings stem from extended forward root edges along each cockpit side and are lightly-swept along the leading edges and straight along their trailing edges, both assemblies able to support up to 3,000 kilograms of external ordnance with the two innermost hardpoints being plumbed for fuel jettisonable fuel stores. The Yak-130 makes use of a pair of conventional horizontal tailplanes and a single vertical tail fin, the latter emanating from above and between the two exhaust ports. The dual-engine layout is aspirated by a pair of well-recessed, oblong air intakes fitted to either side (and aft) of the rear-most cockpit area. The undercarriage is fully retractable in the usual sense and consists of two single-wheeled main landing gear legs and a single-wheeled nose landing gear leg. As detailed below, the Yak-130 comes in a twin-seat form and a single-seat form, the latter for more dedicated roles.\n\r\nThe Yak-130 is powered by a pair of Progress AI-222-25 series turbofans with each installation rated up to 5,500lb of thrust. These supply the airframe with a listed top speed of 644 miles per hour (cruise speed is in the general vicinity of 550 miles per hour) while the aircraft's internal fuel allows for an operational range of 1,600 miles. Its pressurized cabin and high-thrust engines allows operations up to 42,600 feet. Rate-of-climb is a reported 10,000 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nWhile inherently a two-seat advanced jet trainer first, the Yak-130 retains a somewhat limited - albeit still potent - capability to launch self-supported strikes against both ground and air target thanks to its multirole nature. The two-seat approach ultimately divides mission loads between the two pilots in the attack role while also bringing along a \"second pair of eyes\" beyond that of just the single pilot (as well as any onboard sensor equipment being fitted). Light strikes serve such a lightweight airframe well as the multi-faceted wings can take on mixed ordnance loads that include air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, anti-radar missiles, laser-guided munitions, conventional drop bombs, gun pods and rocket pods as well as additional fuel stores (this across nine external hard points, three under each wing). A modern approach to design ensures quick turn-around times between sorties and compatibility with the latest in Russian military hardware. Beyond its light strike role, the Yak-130 can also be outfitted with various sensor and surveillance equipment to undertake general reconnaissance as needed. Such flexibility is at the heart of advanced trainer/light strike mounts like the Yak-130 and copied across like-type aircraft all over the world.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-130 (Mitten)", "aircraft_type": "Advanced Jet Trainer / Light Strike Aircraft"}, {"id": "8ad98b96-2d07-45a6-8c2f-43fa66b7d64e", "year_model": "2018", "description": "\r\n        \tThe path to becoming a military fighter pilot still runs through primary, prop-driven training platforms and even beyond this there is much time spent in Advanced Jet Trainers (AJTs). The Yakovlev Design Bureau (Irkut Corporation) is developing the Yak-152 for the former, relying on proven qualities such as a tandem-seat arrangement and traditional fuselage/wing configuration. The aircraft sports a low-wing monoplane and retractable, wheeled tricycle undercarriage and fits its sole engine in the nose in the usual way, the powerplant driving a three-bladed propeller. The Yak-152 is intended as a stepping-stone design to more AJT forms like the Yakovlev Yak-130 (detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nThe aircraft is built around a reliable, robust framework promising to keep procurement, maintenance and repair costs to a minimum. Dimensions of the product include a length of 7.8 meters, a height of 3.11 meters, and a wingspan of 8.8 meters. Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) is 1,500 kilograms. Performance specs include a maximum speed of 500 kilometers per hour, a service ceiling of 4,000 meters and an operational range out to 1,000 kilometers. Short-field qualities are built-in, giving the aircraft the capability to operate from smaller, unprepared runaways and the undercarriage is reinforced to support such rough function. The airframes are being constructed to allow for a service life of 10,000 hours or thirty years.\n\r\nIn the cockpit, the aircraft carries all-modern avionics to prepare students on the basics of modern flying and can push training into the aerobatic and advanced realms. The student resides in the front cockpit with the instructor in the rear cockpit (both positions unpressurized) and a dual control scheme is used allowing either pilot to take control of the aircraft. Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) provide for very modern work stations and both crewmembers are afforded ejection seats (SKS-94M series) should trouble arise.\n\r\nOriginally-announced power was through an M-14X diesel-fueled turboprop engine outputting 360 horsepower. Now it is confirmed that the aircraft fits a RED Aircraft A03 V-12 series diesel-fueled engine of 500 horsepower.\n\r\nTo date (2016), the Russian Ministry of Defense has committed to the purchase of 150 Yak-152 primary trainers. The prototype was rolled out during mid-June 2016.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-152", "aircraft_type": "Tandem Seat, Single-Engine Primary / Basic Trainer Aircraft"}, {"id": "86e6bf70-fb8e-4bd5-b41b-59000f636cd4", "year_model": "2008", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has proven itself in warfare and humanitarian actions actively across the last two decades. An evolution of the basic approach in design has been seen during that period with ever-smaller units being able to accomplish ever-greater feats in the skies. \"Drone\" aircraft can carry out a plethora of over-battlefield roles these days - either under human command through autonomous action - including intelligence-gathering, reconnaissance of enemy positions/strengths, delivery of medical goods, and identification of enemy combatants or survivors.\n\r\nThe hand-launched ZALA \"421-08\" UAV serves the modern Russian Army primarily in the reconnaissance role. It features a take-off weight of just 5.5lb, a wingspan of 2.66 feet, and an operating range out to 18.65 miles. The aircraft has a mission endurance window of just over 1.5 hours and can reach operating altitudes of 6,560 feet.\n\r\nIts lightweight design makes it man-portable in-the-field and the system's reliance on an electrical powerplant makes for a low acoustic signature when operating close to enemy forces. The airframe consists of single-piece construction for strength and can operate in all-weather environments, carrying its all-important optics set under the bended-wing body design (payload rating is up to 0.66lb). A two-bladed propeller unit is seated at the nose. Navigation is handled through traditional INS means with an SNS (GPS/GLONASS) correction system for accuracy. The unit can be hand- or elastic catapult-launched into action in minutes and is recovered by way of parachute or airbag for reuse.\n\r\nThe 421-08 model series by ZALA Aero Group includes the 421-8M.

The country has made considerable headway in the field of 5th Generation Fighters, advanced bomber concepts, infantry small arms, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Its ongoing war with neighboring Ukraine has given Russia an active battlefield for which to test its various new developments - case-in-point being the STC Orlan-10, an Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance-minded (ISR) UAV which is known to have been used in the War in Donbass.\n\r\nThe Orland-10 operates through the A-95 series gasoline-fueled engine. it is launched by way of catapult (rail) and retrieved through a simply parachute delivery operation. The aircraft can reach speeds nearing 150 kph and can remain airborne for up to 16 hours, delivering data in real-time to operators on the ground out to ranges of 600 kilometers. The system operates at an altitude of about 5,000 meters. Its take-off weight is 15 kilograms and the aircraft can carry a payload of sensors and optics weighing 6 kilograms.\n\r\nIts outward design is conventional as fixed-wing UAVs go.

Since the drone is rail-launched and parachute-recovered, no complex undercarriage is needed in its operation. The aircraft is transported in a hard case and assembled prior to launching. This involves connecting main and tail planes to the fuselage and adjusting any payload options. The catapult rail system also requires some light assembly.\n\r\nAs stated, the Orlan-10 series has been actively used in the fighting in Donbass between Russian elements and Ukrainian Army forces. Several have been claimed downed by Ukrainian forces since its use in the region began in - or around - 2014.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "ZAO ENIX Eleron-3 (Aileron-3)", "aircraft_type": "Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance (ISR) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)"}], "ships": [{"id": "2b6f3f85-cf74-4559-9b8c-08ba78aef97b", "year_model": "1999", "description": "\r\n        \tTo match the American Navy's Arleigh Burke-class multi-mission, guided missile destroyers, Soviet engineers were asked to develop a modernized solution through the existing Udaloy-class ships of fighting ships in 1982. The work spawned the related \"Udaloy II\" class which essentially morphed the anti-submarine-minded group into an anti-ship destroyer platform.  The upgraded class was given an all-new anti-ship missile suite as well as improved local defense capabilities and Fire Control System (FCS).\n\r\nThe product of the class became Admiral Chabanenko (DD-650) while two other vessels were also planned to join her. However, the fall of the Soviet Empire heavily curtailed expansion of the program and resulted in just Chabanenko being completed. The vessel saw its keel laid down on February28th, 1989 and was launched on June 16th, 1994 before seeing formal commissioning on January 28th, 1999. Despite her Cold War roots, she continues in service with the Russian Northern Fleet today (2014).\n\r\nHer planned sisters - Admiral Basisty and Admiral Kucherov - were both laid down in 1991 but never completed and ultimately scrapped in 1994 and 1993 respectively, leaving the Udaloy II-class strength at just one.\n\r\nA key change to the Udaloy-class design to produce the Udaloy II-class was the introduction of the newer \"Zvezda\" M-2 series sonar system. The original pair of 100mm decks guns was replaced by  a twin-gunned 130mm AK-130 installation at the forecastle to provide improved medium-ranged defense against inbound surface threats. The RBU-Udav anti-torpedo suite (twin launchers) increased the ship's standard survivability in the face of emerging submarine threat capabilities from the West and the original anti-submarine SS-N-14 \"Silex\" anti-submarine missiles were given up in favor of the SS-N-22 \"Sunburn\" missile for engaging surface threats at range. Torpedo launch tubes were held near amidships. Aerial threats were countered through an 8 x 8 bank of SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\" surface-to-air missiles in a Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrangement. Close-in defense was aided through 4 x 6 30mm AK630 Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs) Gatling-style cannon suitable for engaging incoming aerial threats including cruise missiles.\n\r\nPower for the vessel came through a conventional gas turbine arrangement - this carried over from the original class and essentially made up of 4 x gas turbines in a COmbined Gas and Gas (COGAG) arrangement feeding 2 x shafts at 120,000 horsepower. COGAG mated two gas turbines to a single shaft, allowing a gearbox to arrange drive power from either one or both of the turbines depending on the amount of power required. In this way, the vessel could utilize either two or all four of its turbines at any one time to accomplish general cruising or short, speedy dashes. Maximum speed in ideal conditions could therefore reach 35 knots with a service range out to 10,500 nautical miles (12,100 miles). \n\r\nThe profile of the Admiral Chabanenko became typical of the Udaloy class with an uneven superstructure design showcasing relatively low profile mast works. The forecastle was home the turreted 130mm deck gun and two banks of two cylindrical, horizontally-mounted launchers identified just ahead of the bridge superstructure. Between the launchers was the Vertical Launch System (VLS). The bridge itself was identified y its large rectangular windows along the front and sides of its design. The various masts contain the equally various communications and sensor arrays required for optimal ship service over vast ocean spaces. At amidships were the two paired mounts of low-profile smoke funnels. A full-service helicopter deck and hangar was added over the stern and supported up to 2 x Kamov naval helicopters in the ASW, Search and Rescue (SAR), or transport roles. The standard operation crew of the vessel was listed at around 300 personnel. Dimensions included a length of 163 meters, a beam of 19.3 meters, and a draught of 6.2 meters. Displacement values reached 6,930 tons under standard load and 7,570 tons under full load.\n\r\nThus far the only notable action pertaining to the Admiral Chabanenko was its passing of the Panama Canal during 2008, marking the first time that a Russian Fleet warship had passed that part of the globe since the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945).\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Chabanenko (DD-650)", "ship_type": "Guided Missile Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "3b1b716b-a5b5-47ef-b402-0d849ce18298", "year_model": "2016", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Admiral Grigorovich-class of guided-missile frigates serving the Russian Navy has a planned strength of six ships.

The debate over large decked carriers has been ongoing for decades starting the 1930's with Stalin; however two carriers were planned but cancelled with the start of WW II with the ground war being the major consideration.  After the war the Soviet Navy saw how the aircraft carrier played a pivotal role in defeating Japan. In 1945 the Soviets drafted plans to construct a new class of carriers by the 1950's. With Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev took over the Soviet state and announced deep military cuts.   The plans to construct a new class of carriers were stopped by Khrushchev feeling that a nuclear strike would eliminate a carrier as a viable weapon so the carrier program became a prime target for cancellation. \n\r\n In the early 1960's when the Brezhnev regime took over, the carrier became a reality with the Moskva and the Leningrad built between 1965 and 1968.  However they were not true aircraft carriers supported only with helicopters, no fixed wing aircraft.  This concept was one of antisubmarine vessels used as a weapon suite that protected against the American nuclear submarine threat.  Again the compromise between the anti sub and fleet protection was the Kiev CVHG class in 1975, both were helicopter vessels.  Arguments between the government and the military continued but the day of the true Soviet aircraft carrier was at hand in 1991 with the Kuznetsov CV class aircraft carrier.\n\r\nAdmiral Kuznetsov was first named \"Riga\" for the city of then \"Leonid Brezhnev\", next was \"Tbilisi\" also a Russian city. Her classification was changed from \"CV\", aircraft carrier, to \"TAVKR\", or heavy aircraft carrying cruiser.  The reason for the name change was the Montreaux Convention in 1936 stated an aircraft carrier CV could not pass through the Dardanelles.   Russia's carriers are built on the Black Sea making this an international issue when the time came for the ships to enter the Mediterranean Sea and beyond.  \n\r\nCurrently Admiral Kuznetsov is the only Russian fixed wing carrier in service.  She is conventionally powered and has a mixture of fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. The carrier's main fixed-wing aircraft is the multirole Su-33. The air groups can perform air superiority, fleet defense, and air support missions.  Also on board are twin seats Su-27, which are used for pilot training along with the Su-25UTG. The carrier also carries the Kamov Ka-27 and Ka-31 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare and troop transport.\n\r\nFixed wing aircraft taking off from the Admiral utilize a ski-jump on the front of the flight deck. Aircraft accelerate up the ski-jump using their afterburners. This results in the  aircraft leaving the flight deck at a modestly higher angle and elevation than on an comparable American aircraft carrier with their flat deck and steam catapults. The ski-jump creates less G-force on the pilot because the acceleration is lower.  The result is a takeoff speed of only 120-140 km/h requiring an aircraft engine that will not stall at low speeds.\n\r\nThe Russian Navy has indicated they will continue to be committed to aircraft carrier development based on the US Navy model.  This is easy to say however it will require massive funds, technology and additional trained naval personnel currently not available.  Also the Khrushchev mind set has not completely gone away with the cost of the USN model and anti-ship missiles making a carrier an easy target in a conflict.  Another issue is the additional cost of the carrier fleet to protect the carrier.   Some in Moscow feel this is not a good argument due to Russian ships having a weapons suite of SSM/SAM missiles on board for air threat protection.  The expansion of a Russian carrier fleet is bleak at best. However the desire to provide political forward presence like the visit to Venezuela on 11/25/08 and Cuba in early 2009 is a top priority.  The future of the Kuznetsov is problematic with parts becoming an issue and refits scheduled closer together.  The Russian government feels she will be in service till 2030, being the only carrier supporting fixed wing aircraft.  Another problem for the military will be to maintain her aged aircraft.    \n\r\nHer sister ship, Varyag was launched in 1988 but never completed.  Some reports indicate is she is to be sold to the Peoples Republic of China another report says she will become a floating hotel.  She is reported to be moored at the Nikolayev South shipyard in Ukraine.   Navy officials indicated due to her material condition she will never go to sea.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Kuznetsov (CV Project 1143-5/6)", "ship_type": "Conventionally-Powered Aircraft Carrier"}, {"id": "78bfd92f-b240-41c0-97dc-62b0409e786b", "year_model": "1988", "description": "\r\n        \tTo match the American Navy's Arleigh Burke-class multi-mission, guided missile destroyers, Soviet engineers were asked to develop a modernized solution through the existing Udaloy-class ships of fighting ships in 1982. The work spawned the related \"Udaloy II\" class which essentially morphed the anti-submarine-minded group into an anti-ship destroyer platform.  The upgraded class was given an all-new anti-ship missile suite as well as improved local defense capabilities and Fire Control System (FCS).\n\r\nThe product of the class became Admiral Chabanenko (DD-650) while two other vessels were also planned to join her. However, the fall of the Soviet Empire heavily curtailed expansion of the program and resulted in just Chabanenko being completed. The vessel saw its keel laid down on February28th, 1989 and was launched on June 16th, 1994 before seeing formal commissioning on January 28th, 1999. Despite her Cold War roots, she continues in service with the Russian Northern Fleet today (2014).\n\r\nHer planned sisters - Admiral Basisty and Admiral Kucherov - were both laid down in 1991 but never completed and ultimately scrapped in 1994 and 1993 respectively, leaving the Udaloy II-class strength at just one.\n\r\nA key change to the Udaloy-class design to produce the Udaloy II-class was the introduction of the newer \"Zvezda\" M-2 series sonar system. The original pair of 100mm decks guns was replaced by  a twin-gunned 130mm AK-130 installation at the forecastle to provide improved medium-ranged defense against inbound surface threats. The RBU-Udav anti-torpedo suite (twin launchers) increased the ship's standard survivability in the face of emerging submarine threat capabilities from the West and the original anti-submarine SS-N-14 \"Silex\" anti-submarine missiles were given up in favor of the SS-N-22 \"Sunburn\" missile for engaging surface threats at range. Torpedo launch tubes were held near amidships. Aerial threats were countered through an 8 x 8 bank of SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\" surface-to-air missiles in a Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrangement. Close-in defense was aided through 4 x 6 30mm AK630 Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs) Gatling-style cannon suitable for engaging incoming aerial threats including cruise missiles.\n\r\nPower for the vessel came through a conventional gas turbine arrangement - this carried over from the original class and essentially made up of 4 x gas turbines in a COmbined Gas and Gas (COGAG) arrangement feeding 2 x shafts at 120,000 horsepower. COGAG mated two gas turbines to a single shaft, allowing a gearbox to arrange drive power from either one or both of the turbines depending on the amount of power required. In this way, the vessel could utilize either two or all four of its turbines at any one time to accomplish general cruising or short, speedy dashes. Maximum speed in ideal conditions could therefore reach 35 knots with a service range out to 10,500 nautical miles (12,100 miles). \n\r\nThe profile of the Admiral Chabanenko became typical of the Udaloy class with an uneven superstructure design showcasing relatively low profile mast works. The forecastle was home the turreted 130mm deck gun and two banks of two cylindrical, horizontally-mounted launchers identified just ahead of the bridge superstructure. Between the launchers was the Vertical Launch System (VLS). The bridge itself was identified y its large rectangular windows along the front and sides of its design. The various masts contain the equally various communications and sensor arrays required for optimal ship service over vast ocean spaces. At amidships were the two paired mounts of low-profile smoke funnels. A full-service helicopter deck and hangar was added over the stern and supported up to 2 x Kamov naval helicopters in the ASW, Search and Rescue (SAR), or transport roles. The standard operation crew of the vessel was listed at around 300 personnel. Dimensions included a length of 163 meters, a beam of 19.3 meters, and a draught of 6.2 meters. Displacement values reached 6,930 tons under standard load and 7,570 tons under full load.\n\r\nThus far the only notable action pertaining to the Admiral Chabanenko was its passing of the Panama Canal during 2008, marking the first time that a Russian Fleet warship had passed that part of the globe since the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945).\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Levchenko (605)", "ship_type": "Guided Missile Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "9d43386f-ef98-489c-b603-d709653dcbc9", "year_model": "2017", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Admiral Grigorovich-class of guided-missile frigates serving the Russian Navy has a planned strength of six ships.

Decades removed from the disastrous turnover experienced at the end of the Cold War, the Russian military budget is consistently growing in an effort to reassert Mother Russia's will in the Asia-Pacific and central Asian regions. One procurement program has produced fruit to become the Borei-class ballistic missile submarine which has since yielded its first vessel-in-class - the \"Yuri Dolgoruky\" (K-535). The Dolgoruky was laid down on November 2nd, 1996 and officially launched on February 13th, 2008. She was formally commissioned on January 10th, 2013. Construction of the boat was handled by Sevmash in Northwest Russia.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Dolgoruky exhibits a conventionally-arranged exterior with a largely cylindrical hull design capped by a bulbous nose cone, the hull running rearwards in a long grand shape before tapering at the stern. The sail is set ahead of amidships while the tail consists of dorsal and ventral vertical tail fins to serve as the rudder with horizontal planes straddling either side of the rear hull. The propeller extends a short distance away from the tail unit. Dimensionally, the Dolgoruky is a massive machine, measuring 170 meters from bow to stern while showcasing a beam of 13.5 meters with draught of 10 meters and carrying a submerged displacement of 24,000 tons. The boat is crewed by 130 officers and sailors divided into shifts with access to onboard shower, dining and sleeping facilities as standard. Power for the Dolgoruky is primarily served through a single OK-650B series nuclear reactor which provides for essentially unlimited operational ranges and decades of service following proper maintenance routines. The nuclear propulsion system is coupled to an AEU steam turbine and the configuration drives a single shaft at the extreme rear of the vessel. A maximum surface speed of 25 knots is listed with a suggested submerged speed of 32 knots being estimated.\n\r\nOverall, production of the Dolgoruky was slow by modern standards as showcased by its laid-down year of 1996 and its launch date of 2008. Some public issues regarding its hastened construction were revealed before the vessel was brought to sea as various equipment and sensor packages had yet to be added. Regardless, construction eventually completed to the point that sea trials were underway by the end of 2009 as a base crew and engineers ironed various issues out of the design. Delays in the program ensured a formal handover did not occur until 2011. After successfully passing her evaluation period, the Dolgoruky was officially handed over for Russian Navy service by late 2012. Since early 2013, the boat has been undergoing limited operational service that will most likely range throughout the year before large-scale service begins in 2014.\n\r\nKey to the design of the Borei-class submarines is her armament which consists of no fewer than 16 x Bulava Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). The Bulava type missiles are an advanced family of new submarine-launched missiles having entered service only recently in early 2013. These weapons were developed through the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology with production handled by the Votkinsk Plant State Production Association. Each missile measures approximately 40 feet long and weighs in at 40 short tons, powered by a  three-stage solid propellant and liquid-based fuel system providing a range out to 5,000 miles. Each missile yields 150 kilotons of lethality with guidance supplied by an inertial and GPS-based system. Originally, the Borei-class was to be outfitted with the \"R-39M\" series missiles but the project was cancelled after lackluster results. The Dolgoruky also fields 6 x 533mm torpedo tubes for anti-ship/submarine sorties and supports the SS-N-15 \"Blizzard\" cruise missile.\n\r\nThe Borei-class of submarine will eventually number ten in all. The second boat - Aleksandr Nevsky - is expected to join the Dolgoruky with commissioning sometime in late 2013 or, more likely, early 2014. The third boat - Vladimir Monomakh - is expected to be commissioned sometime in 2014. Other sister boats will follow as completed, all expected to have entered operational service by 2020.\n\r\nThe arrival of the Dolgoruky is rather significant to the future plans of the Russian Navy, who now sees a renewed expansion in its capabilities thanks to a greater political (and therefore financial) commitment by Russian authorities. With President Vladimir Putin at the helm for another term, the Russian military expects to further expand the lethal reach of her ocean-going force in the decades to come with some $132 billion dollars already earmarked for various ongoing naval programs.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Alexander Nevsky (K-550)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "c6cdc438-a93e-4c1f-adfc-2cdb9a6f4d42", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tThe modern Russian Navy currently (2017) fields five Steregushchiy-class guided-missile corvettes. Some twelve are planned with seven completed and five in active service. Among the group is the Boikiy (532) built by Sevemaya Verf of St. Petersburg. Her keel was laid down on July 27th, 2005 and she was launched to sea on April 15th, 2011. The warship was formally commissioned on May 16th, 2013 and is assigned to the Baltic Sea Fleet.\n\r\nBoikiy displaces 2,100 tons under full load and has a length of 343 feet, a beam of 36 feet and a draught of 12 feet. Her propulsion scheme is a COmbined Diesel And Diesel (CODAD) arrangement allowing either full use, or partial use, of the marine diesels to accomplish full-speed dashing actions or general cruising as an economical measure as needed. Power is through 4 x 16D49 series diesel units developing 24,000 horsepower to 2 x shafts. 4 x Diesel generators (630 kW output) are also installed. This arrangement allows the warship to make headway at 26 knots and range out to 4,000 nautical miles. Endurance with onboard stores and fuel supply is about fifteen days for the crew of 100.\n\r\nThe Boikiy mounts the Furke-E 3D air-search radar and the TK-25E-5 Electronic CounterMeasures (ECM) systems. 4 x PK-10 series launchers serve decoys as needed. Armament is 1 x 100mm A-190 turreted deck gun along with 2 x AK-630M Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs). 2 x 4 330mm torpedo tubes are also carried as are 2 x 14.5mm MTPU heavy machine guns for extreme-close-range actions.\n\r\nAt the heart of the Boikiy's armament suite, however, is the 32-cell missile launcher housing either 9M96E/M or 9M100 Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs). There are also 8 x 3M24 missile launchers featured allowing the warship to tackle just about any incoming ranged threat. To further broaden the vessel's over-the-horizon capabilities is a helipad set over the stern managing a single Kamov Ka-27 Anti-Submarine / Anti-Ship helicopter.\n\r\nThe Boikiy's silhouette is very modern with most of the mass centered on the superstructure.

Over the forecastle is the turret housing the main deck gun. The bridge is integrated into the superstructure and offers a commanding view over the forecastle and to port and starboard. The smoke funnel is also integrated and of a low-profile design. The superstructure is stepped down towards the stern helipad deck.\n\r\nBoikiy was one of the Russian warships featured in the April 2017 incident in which several ships passed through the English Channel and were noted by the British Royal Navy.

In addition to those having served with the Soviet Navy - and now serving with the Russian Navy - a further fourteen remain active with the navy of Indonesia (2017) - these being former East German vessels.\n\r\nThe Soviet/Russian batch of Pachim-class corvettes was/is designated \"Parchim II\" by NATO.\n\r\nDue to the presence of NATO submarines around European shores, the Parchim-class corvettes were ordered by the East German government as anti-submarine platforms. Traditionally, corvettes have marked the smallest warship types in service with any navy. This means they are deliberately given relatively compact dimensions with shallow draughts and enough armament to deal with most of the common threats out there. Additionally, speed and maneuverability are inherently good. The Parchim-class, therefore, displaced just 800 tons under standard load and up to 950 tons under full load. Length was 237.9 feet with a beam of 30.9 feet and a draught of 15 feet. The corvettes were outfitted with 3 x M504 series diesel units and these developing 14,250 horsepower while driving 3 x shafts under stern. The vessels had an outright speed of about 25 knots in ideal conditions and could range out to 2,100 nautical miles.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Buyan-class (Project 21630 / 21631)", "ship_type": "Corvette Warship"}, {"id": "08c6ae99-de28-4e3a-9bc7-1393162c6b9e", "year_model": "1976", "description": "\r\n        \tFor 2013, the Russian Navy is continuing its programs that will see all-new nuclear-attack submarines, missile-minded frigates, advanced helicopter carriers and fast missile corvettes join the modernization initiative. Decades removed from the disastrous turnover experienced at the end of the Cold War, the Russian military budget is consistently growing in an effort to reassert Mother Russia's will in the Asia-Pacific and central Asian regions. One procurement program has produced fruit to become the Borei-class ballistic missile submarine which has since yielded its first vessel-in-class - the \"Yuri Dolgoruky\" (K-535). The Dolgoruky was laid down on November 2nd, 1996 and officially launched on February 13th, 2008. She was formally commissioned on January 10th, 2013. Construction of the boat was handled by Sevmash in Northwest Russia.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Dolgoruky exhibits a conventionally-arranged exterior with a largely cylindrical hull design capped by a bulbous nose cone, the hull running rearwards in a long grand shape before tapering at the stern. The sail is set ahead of amidships while the tail consists of dorsal and ventral vertical tail fins to serve as the rudder with horizontal planes straddling either side of the rear hull. The propeller extends a short distance away from the tail unit. Dimensionally, the Dolgoruky is a massive machine, measuring 170 meters from bow to stern while showcasing a beam of 13.5 meters with draught of 10 meters and carrying a submerged displacement of 24,000 tons. The boat is crewed by 130 officers and sailors divided into shifts with access to onboard shower, dining and sleeping facilities as standard. Power for the Dolgoruky is primarily served through a single OK-650B series nuclear reactor which provides for essentially unlimited operational ranges and decades of service following proper maintenance routines. The nuclear propulsion system is coupled to an AEU steam turbine and the configuration drives a single shaft at the extreme rear of the vessel. A maximum surface speed of 25 knots is listed with a suggested submerged speed of 32 knots being estimated.\n\r\nOverall, production of the Dolgoruky was slow by modern standards as showcased by its laid-down year of 1996 and its launch date of 2008. Some public issues regarding its hastened construction were revealed before the vessel was brought to sea as various equipment and sensor packages had yet to be added. Regardless, construction eventually completed to the point that sea trials were underway by the end of 2009 as a base crew and engineers ironed various issues out of the design. Delays in the program ensured a formal handover did not occur until 2011. After successfully passing her evaluation period, the Dolgoruky was officially handed over for Russian Navy service by late 2012. Since early 2013, the boat has been undergoing limited operational service that will most likely range throughout the year before large-scale service begins in 2014.\n\r\nKey to the design of the Borei-class submarines is her armament which consists of no fewer than 16 x Bulava Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). The Bulava type missiles are an advanced family of new submarine-launched missiles having entered service only recently in early 2013. These weapons were developed through the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology with production handled by the Votkinsk Plant State Production Association. Each missile measures approximately 40 feet long and weighs in at 40 short tons, powered by a  three-stage solid propellant and liquid-based fuel system providing a range out to 5,000 miles. Each missile yields 150 kilotons of lethality with guidance supplied by an inertial and GPS-based system. Originally, the Borei-class was to be outfitted with the \"R-39M\" series missiles but the project was cancelled after lackluster results. The Dolgoruky also fields 6 x 533mm torpedo tubes for anti-ship/submarine sorties and supports the SS-N-15 \"Blizzard\" cruise missile.\n\r\nThe Borei-class of submarine will eventually number ten in all. The second boat - Aleksandr Nevsky - is expected to join the Dolgoruky with commissioning sometime in late 2013 or, more likely, early 2014. The third boat - Vladimir Monomakh - is expected to be commissioned sometime in 2014. Other sister boats will follow as completed, all expected to have entered operational service by 2020.\n\r\nThe arrival of the Dolgoruky is rather significant to the future plans of the Russian Navy, who now sees a renewed expansion in its capabilities thanks to a greater political (and therefore financial) commitment by Russian authorities. With President Vladimir Putin at the helm for another term, the Russian military expects to further expand the lethal reach of her ocean-going force in the decades to come with some $132 billion dollars already earmarked for various ongoing naval programs.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Delta III (Project 667BDR Kalmar)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "5ec0719e-6b50-41ab-b240-e54c9d72661a", "year_model": "1981", "description": "\r\n        \tBy the time of the 1970s, the West was firmly entrenched in a \"Cold War\" with the Soviet Union to the east. The Soviet Union rose to prominence in World War 2, particularly after the German invasion of the country through Operation Barbarossa. While the German Army came within earshot of the Soviet capital of Moscow, the Soviets managed to turn back the tide of the German onslaught through good luck and a massive outpouring of man, machine and patriotism. The Soviet Union went on to claim much of Germany's east interests and eventually captured Berlin proper, only to find a dead Adolf Hitler await them. Regardless, the war prompted the Soviet the Union to become an undisputed superpower in the modern world and a \"cold\" war ensued - primarily between the United States and Russia - in areas of the world that would become their battlefield (Korea in the 1950s, Vietnam from the 1950s into the 1970s). \n\r\nRumors were soon prevalent in the Pentagon that a new weapon was being built behind the \"Iron Curtain\" - a supposedly giant and undetectable nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (essentially real-world story behind the Tom Clancy suspense novel, \"The Hunt for Red October\"). The vessel was laid down on June 30th, 1976 and, in 1981, the lead boat of the \"Akula\", or \"Shark\" class, was completed at the Severodvinsk Shipyard on the White Sea near Archangel and commissioned on December 29th, 1981 as the \"TK-108\" (a total of six submarines in the class would be completed).  Leonid Brezhnev is said to have used the word \"Typhoon\" to describe a new submarine so NATO aptly used this as its reporting name. When the Soviets allowed the submarine to be seen in public for the first time, she quickly became a feared weapon of the Cold War to the pro-western navies of the world. Later, TK-189 was renamed the \"Dmitri Donskoi\" after the Grand Duke of Moscow of 1359.\n\r\nThe Akula-class became the largest submarine ever built up to that point. She was quieter than any previous Russian submarine design attempt due to new \"quiet\" techniques developed specifically for the Typhoon boats. Additionally, she was more maneuverable than the preceding Russian Delta-class submarines. A multi-hulled design fitted no fewer than five inner habitable hulls with two large main parallel hulls. She had nineteen compartments for control rooms, missile launch tubes and electronic equipment. The superstructure was coated with sound absorbent tiles.\n\r\nShe was the first SSBN to have her missile launch tubes installed forward of the sail and, with twenty RSM 52 intercontinental, three-stage, solid propellant ballistic missiles, she fielded more missiles than any of her contemporaries anywhere in the world. The plan for these behemoths was to hide in the North Atlantic waters and, if war came, the class would relocate to predetermined locations under the Arctic ice shelf. She could maintain this submerged position for up to 120 days or more, waiting for the \"go code\" to fire her missiles towards targets across the United States.  Each of the 20 missiles onboard had 10 independently targetable, multiple reentry MIRV's, each with a 100kt nuclear warhead - 200 warheads altogether.  The missiles had a range of 5,157miles (8,300km) and were able to hit a target within a 1,640ft (500m) area.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Dmitri Donskoi (TK-208)", "ship_type": "Ballistic Missile Submarine"}, {"id": "485ca2d9-1f1e-4640-876d-e08f933ddbbd", "year_model": "2019", "ship_name": "Dmitry Rogachev (375) / (Project 22160)", "ship_type": "Patrol Vessel"}, {"id": "095216d6-49a2-4aca-8e3f-443f6bb3d1e0", "year_model": "2018", "ship_name": "Gremyashchiy (Project 20385)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Stealth Corvette Warship"}, {"id": "a3a4613f-22c4-4822-8c48-58b6177510c1", "year_model": "2018", "ship_name": "Gromkiy (335) (Project 20381)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Corvette Warship"}, {"id": "96ce4efe-1c0d-4ab1-8e56-d05a39ba4158", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kilo-class submarine was laid down by the Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering and officially commissioned in April of 1982. 57 total vessels of the class were ultimately completed and 47 remain in active service as of this writing (September 2013). Two have been formally retired from service while a single boat was lost. The Kilo-class replaced the outgoing Tango-class boats while the Kilo-class itself was succeeded by the Lasa-class series. The boats have been exported beyond Soviet/Russian territories and have served with Algeria, China, India, Iran, Poland, Romania and Vietnam. The class is designed primarily for anti-ship/anti-submarine duties.\n\r\nDesign-wise, the Kilo-class displaces at 2,300 tons when surfaced and nearly 4,000 tons when submerged. She features a running length of up to 74 meters with a beam measuring 9.9 meters and a draught of 6.5 meters. The vessel has been tested to depths of 300 meters while oeprational service is typically at 240 meters. The Kilo-class is outfitted with a conventional powerplant arranged as a diesel-electric configuration. This includes 2 x diesel generators outputting 1,000kW of power and tied to 1 x motor delivering up to 6,800 shaft horsepower to a single, multi-bladed, fixed-pitch propeller held along a shaft at the stern. This arrangement allows the vessel a to surfaced speed of 12 knots with a submerged speed nearing 25 knots. Operational range is approximately 7,500 miles when cruising at seven knots along the surface. Range is reduced when submerged to 400 miles heading at 3 knots. The Kilo-class holds enough stores to supply a crew up to 45 days at sea before replenishment is required. Her crew consists of 52 personnel made up of officers and sailors.\n\r\nAs an attack submarine, the craft is outfitted with 6 x 533mm torpedo tubes with 18 x torpedo reloads. Some versions are outfitted further with the Club S anti-ship missile system. The craft can also disperse up to 24 naval mines if required (in place of the torpedo load). Russian variants are defensed on the surface through 8 x SA-N-8 \"Gremlin\" or 8 x SA-N-10 \"Gimlet\" surface-to-air missile systems. \n\r\nThe modern Russian Navy is believed to operate some 17 Kilo submarines today (2013).

The group is led by Admiral Grigorovich (745) herself and currently (2018) includes Admiral Essen (751) and Admiral Makarov (799). Planned ships are Admiral Nutakov, Admiral Istomin, and Admiral Kornilov. All three completed ships are in active service with the Black Sea Fleet. Admiral Makarov, the focus of this article, was laid down at the Yantar Shipyard of Kaliningrad, Russia on February 29th, 2012. She was launched on September 2nd, 2015 and formally commissioned for service on December 27th, 2017 - making her one of the newest additions to the Russian Fleet.\n\r\nAdmiral Makarov is an all-modern warship with stealth features and a low-profile. It sports a slab-sided design, keeping protrusions to a minimum, and features a slew of advanced processing systems and weaponry to suit many maritime roles including airspace deterrence, offshore assault, and fleet support. The smoke funnel is all-enclosed and of a low-profile design. The main mast is also of a low-profile approach, outfitted with a bulk of the sensors and processing systems needed to make the Makarov a suitable modern fighting vessel. Over the stern is a helicopter flight deck suitable for support of a single Kamov Ka-27 navalized helicopter or similar vehicle. A hangar offers full-service capabilities and can house a second helicopter if need be.\n\r\nUnder standard load, the ship displaces 3,620 tons and, under full load, this balloons to 4,035 tons. Overall length reaches 410 feet while the beam measures 50 feet and the draught just 14 feet. Power is through a COGAG (COmbined Gas-And-Gas) arrangement which pairs 2 x DS-71 gas turbines outputting 8,450 horsepower for cruising actions and 2 x DT-59 gas turbines outputting 22,000 horsepower for dash actions. Total output becomes 60,900 horsepower and this is used to drive 2 x Shafts under stern.\n\r\nThe propulsion scheme allows the vessel to make headway at 30 knots and reach out to ranges of 4,850 nautical miles.\n\r\nAboard is a crew complement of about 200 personnel. Onboard stores allow the vessel to stay at-sea for about one month.\n\r\nThe Fregat M2EM serves in the air-search role while the 3Rs-25E Garpun-B, MR-212/201-1, and Nucleus-2 6000A all form the surface-search suite. Fire Control is directed by the JSC-5P-10E \"Puma\", 3R14N-11356, and the MR-90 Orekh SAM systems. Electronic Warfare (EW) involves the TK-25E-5 suite and 4 x KT-216 systems are used to launch decoys.\n\r\nInstalled armament is comprised of a mix of ballistic and missile weapon types. 1 x 100mm A-190 Arsenal turreted main gun is seated over the forecastle. 1 x 8-cell UKSK Vertical Launch System (VLS) can fire both Kalibr and 3M55 Oniks surface-to-surface missiles at range. 2 x 12-cell VLSs are used to house 3S90M Shtil-1 series surface-to-air missiles. Additional anti-aircraft defense is through 8 x Igla-1E missile launchers and 2 x Kashtan Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs). 2 x Twin-tubed 533mm torpedo launchers can counter surface and submarine threats while the latter threat is also addressed by installation of the RBU-6000 Anti-Submarine ROCket (ASROC) launcher unit.\n\r\nAdmiral Makarov maintains an active status in the Russian Fleet as of this writing (2018).\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Ladny (801)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "a396336a-fc03-47d0-812f-1be8b9e41ab0", "year_model": "1985", "ship_name": "Marshal Shaposhnikov (543)", "ship_type": "Multirole Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "ff213c58-1732-419e-b954-1821d7bade4f", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tTowards the end of the Cold War (1947-1991), the Soviet Union invested heavily in a new class of conventionally-powered fighting cruisers, the Slava-class. The group was to number ten total warships and succeed the Kara-class in the guided-missile cruiser role but the end of the Soviet Empire limited the class to just three active ships while the remaining seven were cancelled. The ones to enter service became Slava, Admiral Flota and Chervona Ukrayina. Within the inventory of the reborn Russian Navy, the vessels were renamed to become Moskva, Marshal Ustinov and Varyag, respectively.\n\r\nVaryag, the third of the group, saw her keel laid down in 1979 by 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant and she was launched to sea in July of 1983. Formally commissioned on October 16th, 1989, she was assigned to the Pacific Fleet where she remains active today (2017). A major overhaul in 2008 has kept her a viable instrument-of-war for today's highly-advanced battlefields.\n\r\nAs built, Varyag was given a displacement of 11,500 tons. Overall length measured 611.5 feet with a beam (width) of 68.2 feet and a draught of 27.5 feet. Her propulsion scheme was a COGOG (COmbined Gas Or Gas) arrangement in which one set of engines or the other was used to accomplish such actions and general cruising or high-speed dashing. As such, the scheme was made up of 2 x M70 gas turbines (for cruising) and 4 x M8KF gas turbines (for dashing). These drove upwards of 121,000 horsepower to 2 x Shafts under stern and propelled the warship to speeds of 32 knots out to ranges of 3,000 nautical miles.\n\r\nOnboard there was provision for a crew of 480 and an air arm managed operations of a single Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 \"Helix\" navalized helicopter.\n\r\nIn its more modern arrangement, the warship is outfitted with a bevy of processing systems and sensors including the Voskhod MR-800 3D search radar and the Fregat MR-710 3D search radar. Rum Tub and Side Globe antennas as part of the Electronics Warfare (EW) fit.\n\r\nAt the heart of this warship remains its armament suite. This is led by 16 x P-500 Bazalt anti-ship missile launchers. Air defense / denial is through 64 x S-300F \"Fort\" (8x8 cells) long-range surface-to-air missiles as well as 40 x OSA-MA (2x20 cells) short-range surface-to-air missiles. 6 x AK-630 serve in the Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) air defense role. Over the forecastle is a twin-gunned 130mm AK-130 turreted deck gun and 2 x RBU-6000 mortar launchers are carried as a range submarine defensive measure. Additionally there are no fewer than ten 533mm torpedo tubes held in two quintuple launchers.\n\r\nBeyond this projectile- and missile-based armament suite is the aforementioned helicopter which provides valuable over-the-horizon service in the anti-ship / anti-submarine role and can double as a maritime reconnaissance and Search  and Rescue (SAR) platform.\n\r\nAs warships go, Varyag is conventionally arranged with a bridge superstructure worked in as part of the overall main structure. A pyramidal main mast is featured aft of the bridge section and a pair of smoke funnels are seated, side-by-side, at midships. These are of a low-profile design. A secondary mast is featured ahead of these structures. Closer to the stern is a secondary superstructure with various systems atop it. The flight deck makes up the stern area of the ship.\n\r\nRelatively fast for its size and very well armed, Varyag is a potent opponent within the ranks of the modern Russian Navy. Modernization has certainly helped the vessel remain a critical contributor to Russian Navy actions.\n\r\nVaryag made the first visit of a Russian/Soviet warship to an American port in 147 years when it stopped in San Francisco in June of 2010. The warship has since conducted other friendly port calls and is known to have been called to the Mediterranean Sea offshore of war-torn Syria in January of 2016. While this reinforces Russian military ties to Syria and its beleaguered leadership, it promotes Russian Navy strength while adding valuable training for its crew in a war environment.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Marshal Ustinov (Project 1164 Atlant)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Cruiser Warship"}, {"id": "67f6590d-fa5b-4d01-a4ca-0209429ff4d3", "year_model": "2010", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Nakhimov (hull number 889) is part of the Grachonok-class of \"anti-saboteur\" patrol vessels fielded by the modern Russian Navy.

The RBU-Udav anti-torpedo suite (twin launchers) increased the ship's standard survivability in the face of emerging submarine threat capabilities from the West and the original anti-submarine SS-N-14 \"Silex\" anti-submarine missiles were given up in favor of the SS-N-22 \"Sunburn\" missile for engaging surface threats at range. Torpedo launch tubes were held near amidships. Aerial threats were countered through an 8 x 8 bank of SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\" surface-to-air missiles in a Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrangement. Close-in defense was aided through 4 x 6 30mm AK630 Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs) Gatling-style cannon suitable for engaging incoming aerial threats including cruise missiles.\n\r\nPower for the vessel came through a conventional gas turbine arrangement - this carried over from the original class and essentially made up of 4 x gas turbines in a COmbined Gas and Gas (COGAG) arrangement feeding 2 x shafts at 120,000 horsepower. COGAG mated two gas turbines to a single shaft, allowing a gearbox to arrange drive power from either one or both of the turbines depending on the amount of power required. In this way, the vessel could utilize either two or all four of its turbines at any one time to accomplish general cruising or short, speedy dashes. Maximum speed in ideal conditions could therefore reach 35 knots with a service range out to 10,500 nautical miles (12,100 miles). \n\r\nThe profile of the Admiral Chabanenko became typical of the Udaloy class with an uneven superstructure design showcasing relatively low profile mast works. The forecastle was home the turreted 130mm deck gun and two banks of two cylindrical, horizontally-mounted launchers identified just ahead of the bridge superstructure. Between the launchers was the Vertical Launch System (VLS). The bridge itself was identified y its large rectangular windows along the front and sides of its design. The various masts contain the equally various communications and sensor arrays required for optimal ship service over vast ocean spaces. At amidships were the two paired mounts of low-profile smoke funnels. A full-service helicopter deck and hangar was added over the stern and supported up to 2 x Kamov naval helicopters in the ASW, Search and Rescue (SAR), or transport roles. The standard operation crew of the vessel was listed at around 300 personnel. Dimensions included a length of 163 meters, a beam of 19.3 meters, and a draught of 6.2 meters. Displacement values reached 6,930 tons under standard load and 7,570 tons under full load.\n\r\nThus far the only notable action pertaining to the Admiral Chabanenko was its passing of the Panama Canal during 2008, marking the first time that a Russian Fleet warship had passed that part of the globe since the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945).\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Severomorsk (619) / (Project 619)", "ship_type": "Guided Missile Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "d7080bc5-bade-4518-b486-a5aaf660ea4b", "year_model": "1967", "ship_name": "Shmel-class (Project 1204)", "ship_type": "Armored Artillery Gunboat / Patrol Boat"}, {"id": "54dd9188-9caf-441d-8f9d-efc9a5a5190c", "year_model": "2011", "ship_name": "Soobrazitelnyy (531)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Corvette Warship"}, {"id": "6b0bd196-5106-4b42-827d-354fceabd208", "year_model": "1980", "description": "\r\n        \tLike many other leading naval powers of the world, the Russian Navy fields a healthy collection of destroyer warships - about thirteen in all - behind the United States (65), Japan (36) and China (29). Such ship types are built to be fast in the water and reach out to far-off destinations on internal fuel and can be used as independent solutions / deterrents or as part of the main fighting force. Flexibility-in-service is expanded by the type's ability to feature a flexible armament suite which allows the ships to tackle just about any at-sea threat - be it in the air, on the water, or under it.\n\nRussian Navy Destroyers\n\r\nThe Russian Navy currently (2018) operates three distinct batches of destroyer warships - the Kashin-class, Udaloy-class and Sovremennyy-class. The Sovremennyy-class (Project 956) numbered twenty-one ships when it was ultimately adopted and finally completed though only three of her number are in active service today (2018): Bystryy, Nastoychivyy and Admiral Ushakov commissioned in 1989, 1993 and 1994, respectively (Burnyy is said to be undergoing modernization as of this writing, 2018). All displace in the 7,940 ton range. Bystryy is assigned to the Pacific Fleet, Nastoychivyy to the Baltic Fleet and Admiral Ushakov to the Northern Fleet.\n\r\nAll were built by Severnaya Verf 190 of St. Petersburg.\n\r\nThe Sovremennyy-class was used to succeed the aging Kashin-class but was itself succeeded by the Lider-class. China adopted the design as well in the late-1990s/early-2000s.\n\nBackground\n\r\nThe submarine was the bread-and-butter instrument of the Soviet Navy throughout the Cold War but World War 2 (1939-1945) continue to influence post-war doctrine for all sides and revealed the value of surprise amphibious landings against an enemy. As such, the Soviet Navy was continually drawn up to include gun-laden warships to support such actions in far-away lands. New warships were taken from drawing boards to shipyards, including the Sovremennyy-class, and the \"multi-mission\" mindset for these ships soon was introduced to help evolve the line and keep them on par with American counterparts in the West.\n\nSpecifciations\r\nAs such, the group is designed for several key operating roles including airspace denial, anti-ship sorties and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). Displacement is 6,600 tons under standard load and 8,500 tons under full load. Dimensions include a running length of 511.9 feet with a beam of 56.8 feet and a draught of 21.3 feet. Power is from 4 x Boiler units feeding 2 x Steam turbines producing 100,000 horsepower to 2 x Shafts. 2 x Turbo-generators and 2 x Diesel generators complete the propulsion scheme.\n\r\nThe warships are able to range out to an impressive 16,000 miles and reach speeds nearing 33 knots in open sea under ideal conditions.\n\r\nAboard is a crew of 350 personnel. An air arm is part of the crew for the sole helipad can support a single Kamov Ka-27 \"Helix\" (or similar) navy helicopter equipped for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), anti-ship or at-sea replenishment roles.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Sovremennyy-class (Project 956 Sarych)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "7e572b6c-73f1-4a88-8537-a62e9c738a19", "year_model": "2007", "ship_name": "Steregushchiy (530) (Project 20380)", "ship_type": "Corvette / Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "c03267bc-fd93-49dd-b5eb-319cf9222932", "year_model": "1977", "ship_name": "Tarantul / Project 1241/12411/1242 (class)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Corvette Warship"}, {"id": "743d4dd4-7d6c-4300-bba4-e03a522c4034", "year_model": "1981", "ship_name": "Typhoon (class)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine"}, {"id": "e7b78df4-59b6-433a-bd5e-4c07754fe4bf", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tTowards the end of the Cold War (1947-1991), the Soviet Union invested heavily in a new class of conventionally-powered fighting cruisers, the Slava-class. The group was to number ten total warships and succeed the Kara-class in the guided-missile cruiser role but the end of the Soviet Empire limited the class to just three active ships while the remaining seven were cancelled. The ones to enter service became Slava, Admiral Flota and Chervona Ukrayina. Within the inventory of the reborn Russian Navy, the vessels were renamed to become Moskva, Marshal Ustinov and Varyag, respectively.\n\r\nVaryag, the third of the group, saw her keel laid down in 1979 by 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant and she was launched to sea in July of 1983. Formally commissioned on October 16th, 1989, she was assigned to the Pacific Fleet where she remains active today (2017). A major overhaul in 2008 has kept her a viable instrument-of-war for today's highly-advanced battlefields.\n\r\nAs built, Varyag was given a displacement of 11,500 tons. Overall length measured 611.5 feet with a beam (width) of 68.2 feet and a draught of 27.5 feet. Her propulsion scheme was a COGOG (COmbined Gas Or Gas) arrangement in which one set of engines or the other was used to accomplish such actions and general cruising or high-speed dashing. As such, the scheme was made up of 2 x M70 gas turbines (for cruising) and 4 x M8KF gas turbines (for dashing). These drove upwards of 121,000 horsepower to 2 x Shafts under stern and propelled the warship to speeds of 32 knots out to ranges of 3,000 nautical miles.\n\r\nOnboard there was provision for a crew of 480 and an air arm managed operations of a single Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 \"Helix\" navalized helicopter.\n\r\nIn its more modern arrangement, the warship is outfitted with a bevy of processing systems and sensors including the Voskhod MR-800 3D search radar and the Fregat MR-710 3D search radar. Rum Tub and Side Globe antennas as part of the Electronics Warfare (EW) fit.\n\r\nAt the heart of this warship remains its armament suite. This is led by 16 x P-500 Bazalt anti-ship missile launchers. Air defense / denial is through 64 x S-300F \"Fort\" (8x8 cells) long-range surface-to-air missiles as well as 40 x OSA-MA (2x20 cells) short-range surface-to-air missiles. 6 x AK-630 serve in the Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) air defense role. Over the forecastle is a twin-gunned 130mm AK-130 turreted deck gun and 2 x RBU-6000 mortar launchers are carried as a range submarine defensive measure. Additionally there are no fewer than ten 533mm torpedo tubes held in two quintuple launchers.\n\r\nBeyond this projectile- and missile-based armament suite is the aforementioned helicopter which provides valuable over-the-horizon service in the anti-ship / anti-submarine role and can double as a maritime reconnaissance and Search  and Rescue (SAR) platform.\n\r\nAs warships go, Varyag is conventionally arranged with a bridge superstructure worked in as part of the overall main structure. A pyramidal main mast is featured aft of the bridge section and a pair of smoke funnels are seated, side-by-side, at midships. These are of a low-profile design. A secondary mast is featured ahead of these structures. Closer to the stern is a secondary superstructure with various systems atop it. The flight deck makes up the stern area of the ship.\n\r\nRelatively fast for its size and very well armed, Varyag is a potent opponent within the ranks of the modern Russian Navy. Modernization has certainly helped the vessel remain a critical contributor to Russian Navy actions.\n\r\nVaryag made the first visit of a Russian/Soviet warship to an American port in 147 years when it stopped in San Francisco in June of 2010. The warship has since conducted other friendly port calls and is known to have been called to the Mediterranean Sea offshore of war-torn Syria in January of 2016. While this reinforces Russian military ties to Syria and its beleaguered leadership, it promotes Russian Navy strength while adding valuable training for its crew in a war environment.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Varyag (011)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Cruiser Warship"}, {"id": "f60a7388-abd3-4946-8e2a-6eb09435c4dc", "year_model": "2018", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian Navy has done well in reestablishing itself as one of the top services in the northern hemisphere and this sort of growth, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, has not come cheap. The result, however, is an all-modern fighting force that can be deployed to far-off parts of the world and attack from offshore locations, from under the water, or from the vast fleet of surface combatants available to the fleet.\n\r\nIn 2014, there began construction of a new class of stealth patrol vessel under the Project 22160 designation. Six have been planned for the group with two already in active service (Vasily Bykov 368 and Dmitriy Rogachev 375), one having completed construction and launched (Pavel Derzhavin), and a further three ready to be added from 2020 to 2022.\n\r\nThe first ship of the class, technically its lead ship, is Vasily Bykov (368) built by the builders at Zelenodolsk Shipyard. Her keel was laid down on February 26th, 2014 and she was launched on August 28th, 2017. Formally commissioned on December 20th, 2018, Bykov serves the Black Sea fleet under active status as of this writing (September 2019).\n\r\nAs completed, Bykov exudes modern design lines and stealth features, complete with a chine hull integrating the upper and lower halves of the ship with broad swathes of slab-sided surfaces. An enclosed turreted deck gun is seated at the forecastle and immediately aft of this is an elevated section of hull containing the bridge and short-profile enclosed main mast.  The mast is home to all manner of sensors, processing units, and radar fits to serve in the search, tracking, communications, and weapons direction roles. The hull superstructure is contained forward of midships to which its lines are then stepped and elegantly shape the mid-to-aft sections. A helipad is seated over the stern to support a single navy helicopter (typically the Kamov Ka-27 or Ka-226 types). The smoke funnel, found at midships, is of a low-profile, fully-enclosed design to limit the ship's signature.\n\r\nDisplacement of the class runs between 13,000 and 1,700 tons. Overall length reaches 308 feet with a beam of 46 feet and a draught of 11 feet. Installed power constitutes a COmbined Diesel-and-Gas (CODAG) arrangement involving 2 x Kolomna 16D49 marine diesels outputting 6,000 horsepower for cruising and 2 x M70FRU/M90FRU gas turbine units for high-speed dash actions. To this is added an electric unit comprised of 4 x Diesel generators and an emergency diesel unit. The propulsion scheme allows for a maximum headway speed of 30 knots out to a range of 6,000 miles.\n\r\nAboard is a crew of about eighty and stores with fuel supplies allow the ship to remain at sea, on station, for up to 60 days before needing resupply.\n\r\nSystems, processing units, and self-preservation is provided for by the Pal-N system, Pozitiv-MK radar fits, Sfera-2 opto-electric station, and TK-25 series Electronic Warfare (EW) suite.\n\r\nIn terms of armament, the patrol vessel is allowed a combination weapons set to deal with many target types. This is led by a Dual-Purpose (DP) turreted deck gun over the bow (of 57mm or 76.2mm caliber), 2 x 14.5mm MTPU Heavy Machine Guns (HMGs), 1 x DP-65 Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL), DP-64 Grenade Launcher (GL) and support for 324mm Paket-NK torpedoes, the \"Kalibr-NK\" anti-ship missile, and 3M24 \"Buk\" Anti-Aircraft (AA) missile system. With this arrangement, the relatively compact vessel can be called upon to accomplish a variety of armed roles including interception, scouting, fleet support, and deterrence.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Vasily Bykov (368) / (Project 22160)", "ship_type": "Patrol Ship"}, {"id": "33bceace-1c18-4a42-9c30-2b2b658a874b", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe modern Russian Navy fields a destroyer force of about a dozen ships and these are broken down into three major supported classes - Kashin, Udaloy and Sovremennyy. By quantity, Udaloy leads the way and includes Vice-Admiral Kulakov (626), a 7,570 ton vessel commissioned into Soviet Navy service in 1982. She serves with the Northern Fleet as of this writing (2017).\n\r\nThe Udaloy-class were originally developed in the latter stages of the Cold War period (1947-1991) when the primary enemy were American submarines. As such, the class was constructed for anti-submarine functions and a dozen were completed in two standards - \"Udaloy I\" and \"Udaloy II\". Udaloy II numbered just one warship which was completed in the late-1990s to a modernized standard. Two warships of the class were later cancelled as the Russian Navy entered a period of decay and slashed budgets following the demise of the Soviet Empire.\n\r\nVice-Admiral Kulakov, named after Soviet statesman Fyodor Davydovich Kulakov, was launched in 1980 and became active in 1982. She entered an extended period of refitting that lasted from 1991 to 2010 in which some of her systems and facilities were modernized. She remains active as of this writing (2017).\n\r\nKulakov displaces 6,200 tons under standard load and up to 8,000 tons under full load. Her length measures 535 feet with a beam of 62 feet and a draught of 26 feet. Power is through a \"COmbined Gas And Gas\" (COGAG) arrangement which sees 4 x Gas turbines generating a combined 120,000 horsepower driving 2 x Shafts. Speeds reach 35 knots and range is out to 10,500 nautical miles. This makes Kulakov both fast and of good endurance coupled with the ability to accomplish blue water work as part of the fleet or as an individual entity sent out to hunt submarines. However, she lacks more modern design lines and any obvious \"stealth-ification\" as seen in Western warships - there are many protrusions and exposed spaces on the vessel which provide a larger signature than is typically wanted in modern ship design.\n\r\nAboard there are 300 personnel. A helicopter deck over the stern supports up to 2 x Kamov Ka-27 \"Helix\" navy submarines which are equipped to search, track and destroyer submarines and surface warships beyond the visual range of the ship itself. A hangar provides full service facilities for maintenance and repair. In addition to maritime work, these helicopters can also support amphibious assault actions close-to-shore. Of note is that the warship now can launch and retrieve the powerful Kamov Ka-52 \"Alligator\" dedicated attack helicopter which is also used by the Russian Navy - and this provides an excellent attack platform for when assailing shoreline and inshore positions during an amphibious assault.\n\r\nStandard armament  of Kulakov includes 2 x SS-N-14 anti-submarine/anti-ship missiles arranged in quad-launchers. There is a Vertical Launching System (VLS) for SA-N-9 Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) to counter aerial threats to the ship (or fleet). More conventional, projectile-minded firepower comes from 2 x 100mm turreted deck guns (single-gunned mountings) and 4 x 30mm AK630 Gatling systems used in the Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) role. The warship is outfitted with 2 x 533mm (22\") torpedo tubes in quadruple launcher mountings. 2 x RBU-6000 Anti-Submarine ROCket (ASROC) launchers are also carried. With all this, Kulakov can attack and defend as is necessary - be the threat from the air (aircraft / cruise missiles), on the sea or under it.\n\r\nDespite all this, Kulakov is an old warship with origins seen in the Cold War years despite the attempts at modernization (which kept her from sailing for nearly two decades). A fire in January 2011 caused by a short circuit incident damaged her internals some so this delayed her sea-going ventures even more. It is only very recently that her career has become active: She was used in the convoy escort role in 2012 and arrived offshore Syria to support Russian actions in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. In 2013 she participated in World War 2 celebrations hosted by the United Kingdom. In April of 2014 she was sighted by British warships passing close to English shores which made global headlines. For 2016, she was stationed once more off the coast of Syria in support of addition Russian participation on behalf of the local government in its fight against various rebel factions.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Vice-Admiral Kulakov (626)", "ship_type": "Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "76bac5da-739a-4123-a2fb-2ed354c569cf", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tFor 2013, the Russian Navy is continuing its programs that will see all-new nuclear-attack submarines, missile-minded frigates, advanced helicopter carriers and fast missile corvettes join the modernization initiative. Decades removed from the disastrous turnover experienced at the end of the Cold War, the Russian military budget is consistently growing in an effort to reassert Mother Russia's will in the Asia-Pacific and central Asian regions. One procurement program has produced fruit to become the Borei-class ballistic missile submarine which has since yielded its first vessel-in-class - the \"Yuri Dolgoruky\" (K-535). The Dolgoruky was laid down on November 2nd, 1996 and officially launched on February 13th, 2008. She was formally commissioned on January 10th, 2013. Construction of the boat was handled by Sevmash in Northwest Russia.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Dolgoruky exhibits a conventionally-arranged exterior with a largely cylindrical hull design capped by a bulbous nose cone, the hull running rearwards in a long grand shape before tapering at the stern.

The boat is crewed by 130 officers and sailors divided into shifts with access to onboard shower, dining and sleeping facilities as standard. Power for the Dolgoruky is primarily served through a single OK-650B series nuclear reactor which provides for essentially unlimited operational ranges and decades of service following proper maintenance routines.

A maximum surface speed of 25 knots is listed with a suggested submerged speed of 32 knots being estimated.\n\r\nOverall, production of the Dolgoruky was slow by modern standards as showcased by its laid-down year of 1996 and its launch date of 2008. Some public issues regarding its hastened construction were revealed before the vessel was brought to sea as various equipment and sensor packages had yet to be added. Regardless, construction eventually completed to the point that sea trials were underway by the end of 2009 as a base crew and engineers ironed various issues out of the design. Delays in the program ensured a formal handover did not occur until 2011. After successfully passing her evaluation period, the Dolgoruky was officially handed over for Russian Navy service by late 2012. Since early 2013, the boat has been undergoing limited operational service that will most likely range throughout the year before large-scale service begins in 2014.\n\r\nKey to the design of the Borei-class submarines is her armament which consists of no fewer than 16 x Bulava Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). The Bulava type missiles are an advanced family of new submarine-launched missiles having entered service only recently in early 2013. These weapons were developed through the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology with production handled by the Votkinsk Plant State Production Association. Each missile measures approximately 40 feet long and weighs in at 40 short tons, powered by a  three-stage solid propellant and liquid-based fuel system providing a range out to 5,000 miles. Each missile yields 150 kilotons of lethality with guidance supplied by an inertial and GPS-based system. Originally, the Borei-class was to be outfitted with the \"R-39M\" series missiles but the project was cancelled after lackluster results. The Dolgoruky also fields 6 x 533mm torpedo tubes for anti-ship/submarine sorties and supports the SS-N-15 \"Blizzard\" cruise missile.\n\r\nThe Borei-class of submarine will eventually number ten in all.

The third boat - Vladimir Monomakh - is expected to be commissioned sometime in 2014. Other sister boats will follow as completed, all expected to have entered operational service by 2020.\n\r\nThe arrival of the Dolgoruky is rather significant to the future plans of the Russian Navy, who now sees a renewed expansion in its capabilities thanks to a greater political (and therefore financial) commitment by Russian authorities.

With President Vladimir Putin at the helm for another term, the Russian military expects to further expand the lethal reach of her ocean-going force in the decades to come with some $132 billion dollars already earmarked for various ongoing naval programs.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Yuri Dolgoruky (K-535)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "3eca849b-60d3-4a49-a62d-c8c7aebd9aa7", "year_model": "1988", "description": "\r\n        \tThe amphibious assault has proven to be one of the most dangerous, yet ultra-critical, components of warfare since ancient times. As such, it falls onto naval forces to supply the fighting men and machines with the means to cross over from water to land in an attempt to carry the fight to the enemy. Various naval powers of the world have invested mightily in the technologies that enable such doctrine to exist and the Soviet Navy contracted for the massive \"Zubr-class\" LCAC (\"Landing Craft Air Cushion\") before the fall of the Soviet Empire (1922-1991). The first vessel in the class was commissioned in 1988, representing the largest air-cushioned vehicles in the world. In the post-Cold War world, their service now falls under the Russian Navy flag as well as several other powers of the world.\n\r\nThe Zubr-class is identified by NATO as the \"Pomornik\" and is also known by the Soviet/Russian Navy designation of \"Project 1232.2\".\n\r\nThe Zubr craft is given a length of 187 feet with a beam measuring 84 feet and a draught of 5.2 feet. It displaces at 415 tons when under normal load and reaches 555 tons when under full load. Her profile includes a bridge superstructure at amidships with three large, shrouded propulsion fans aft. The forward section of the boat is largely unobstructed and sports a raised bow with a lowering ramp for embarking/disembarking units, systems, cargo and infantry. The hull - specially-designed to mitigate the effects of magnetic naval mines - sits atop an inflatable bed which provides the necessary cushion when going ashore. The cushion is deflated to bring the bow ramp to ground level. The Zubr craft features a surface search radar, chaff launcher and decoys among other integrated systems. Armament (largely self-defensive in nature) includes Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) launchers, 2 x 30mm AK-630 cannons and 2 x rocket launchers. The vessel can also dispense naval or anti-personnel mines as required.\n\r\nInternally, the Zubr features a centralized hold for carrying vehicles or cargo. Living spaces for the four officers, 31 enlisted personnel and combat-ready infantry are afforded while being fully protected by an NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) system in the event of nuclear war. Some creature comforts are also added including eating areas, heating and cooling to allow the Zubr to operate in most any climate setting. The vessel's hold can house up to three Main Battle Tank (MBT) type vehicles, up to eight Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) or similar, ten general military vehicles or up to 500 infantry. Of course the craft can also replace these items with pure cargo, taking advantage of its 4,300 square foot hold.\n\r\nThe Zubr relies on a combination of 5 x Kuznetsov NK-12MV series, gasoline-fueled turboprop engines, two used for generating the necessary lift and three utilized in propelling the vessel. All told, these installations generate up to 11,836 horsepower. The three propulsion engines manage four variable-pitch propeller assemblies. The Zubr can make up to 40 knots in ideal conditions and reach speeds up to 60 knots under certain conditions. Operational range is listed out to 300 miles. The hull is designed for operations in up to \"Sea State 4\", which identifies wave heights of four feet to eight feet.\n\r\nTo date (2014), only nine examples of the Zubr have appeared. Two are in service with the Russian Navy (770 Evgeny Kocheshkov and 782 Mordovia) while two have been acquired by the Ukrainian Navy (U420 and U424). The Greek (Hellenic) Navy  has taken on service of four vessels and originated from both Russia and Ukraine. These are named in addition to their hull numbers - HS Kefalonia (L180), HS Ithaki (L181), HS Kerkyra (L182) and HS Zakynthos (L183). The Chinese Navy is believed to have contracted for four of the large amphibious vessels with two of them to be built in Chinese shipyards. One has already been taken into service.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Zubr LCAC (Pomornik) (Project 1232.2)", "ship_type": "Air-Cushioned Landing Craft"}]}]}
