"weapon_type": "Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) Weapon", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russo-Ukrainian War of 2022 has seen an expansion of over-battlefield Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in use at various levels. Types range from run-of-the-mill, off-the-shelf commercial products and similar ISR models to 'kamikaze' style loitering munitions and dedicated direct-combat forms. To counter the active threat being posed by Ukrainian drones to Russian ground forces, elements of the Army are deploying \"counter-UAS\" systems in turn - to date this includes the \"LPD-801\", the \"REX-2\" (both detailed elsewhere on this site), and - more recently - the PARS \"STUPOR\" C-UAS solution.\n\r\nAccording to Russian reports, the STUPOR was first used operationally in early July 2022. Design of the weapon was through the Main Robotics Research and Test Center of the Russian Ministry of Defense. The prototype form was seen at the Army-2017 exposition.\n\r\nLike other products of this type, the general arrangement of the weapon is \"rifle-like\" and, as such, it incorporates a pistol-grip / trigger unit slung under the body, a pseudo-shoulder stock outcropping at rear, and an oversized forend which houses the pertinent internals and acts as a forward support with the offhand. A sighting device is seated over the frame for some accuracy at-range. A shoulder strap allows for relatively easy transport of the weapon when \"on-the-march\". Power is supplied from an onboard battery pack. Recharging can be handled through a conventional outlet or even an automobile battery if needed.\n\r\nA conventional trigger unit is used to actuate the weapon, which is pointed via Line-of-Sight (LoS) at the airborne target in question. The subsequent action disrupts (or attempts to) the communications / navigation channels being sent-from / delivered to the drone by way of electromagnetic pulses, resulting in the unit losing control and crashing to the ground.\n\r\nRange of the gun is out to 1.25 miles, making it ideal only against low-flying threats.\n\r\nAs more and more UASs re deployed by various fighting forces across the globe, more and more services will be employing infantry-level / tactical-level counter-UAS solutions in some shape and form.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "53dfb368-df07-444f-a43f-8a65001be7ce", "year_model": "2022", "weapon_name": "PPSH Labs LPD-801", "weapon_type": "Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe LPD-801 is a Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) designed, developed, and manufactured by Russia. The system is a direct solution to the threat posed by many common low-flying unmanned aerial threats - recognized generically today as \"drones\". Development of this radio-electronic / Electronic Warfare (EW) \"rifle\" was handled by engineers of PPSH Laboratory and the system has been photographed in active use by Russian ground forces in its ongoing war with neighboring Ukraine.\n\r\nThe complete system takes on a \"rifle-like\" shape for familiarity to any infantry personnel. The receiver is bookended by a shoulder stock at the rear for support and a \"silencer-like\" assembly at the front containing the signal-interrupting gear.

A vertical foregrip is positioned aft of the tubular forward housing section a carrying handle is featured over the frame, complete with a full-length of Picatinny rail for mounting various tactical optics.\n\r\nThe LPD-801 tips the scales at just 7.7lb, making it highly portable in the field, no heavier or bulkier than a modern infantry-level tactical assault rifle.\n\r\nReportedly, the system has a range out to 1 mile, making it an ideal counter to low-flying drones, particularly those used in the Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance (ISR) role or with limited attack functionality. As with other counter-drone solutions, the LPD-801 attacks these aircraft by attempting to interrupt their inbound communications signals, ideally driving the drone into a state of confusion and (ultimately) sending the unit crashing to the ground - neutralizing the threat at range.\n\r\nBeyond Russia, the United Arab Emirates is said to be one export operator of this C-UAS.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "6528b9f4-aad5-429b-bfd0-cd3df84cd8ea", "year_model": "2022", "weapon_name": "Tecmash AGS-40 (Balkan)", "weapon_type": "Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe grenade launcher has been a fixture of the modern battlefield for some time and has proven itself a terrifying suppression and psychological weapon. It finds itself in the active inventories of many armies today and is the perfect counter to stubborn, dug-in enemy personnel. Modern-day systems are capable of select-fire, indirect fire, and can be coupled with assault rifles, fired from portable tripods, vehicle mounts, and from moving aircraft - such is their versatility.\n\r\nDuring the Cold War period (1947-1991), the Soviet Army and its allied forces relied on the trusted AGS-17 series belt-fed Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) for this sort of in-direct suppression fire. Introduced in 1970, this weapon went on to see combat service from the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) to the more modern engagements of the Nagomo-Karabakh War (2020). After the fall of the Soviet Empire, the series was directly succeeded by the modern AGS-30 in 1995 and this product has also gone on to build its own extensive resume, seeing service in wars around the globe beginning with the 2nd Chechen War. Against this backdrop, the Russian Army has now moved to introduce an even more modern equivalent to these storied solutions - the AGS-40 \"Balkan\".\n\r\nThe AGS-40 has design roots in the Cold War during the 1980s, the work finally culminating in 2017 under TsKIB SOO. The lengthy development cycle is attributed to the tumultuous period following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disarray and economic slump that followed hampered the Russian arms industry. Before long, manufacture of the weapon system began in earnest under the Tecmash Research and Production Association (TRPA) label and this initiative has been ongoing since 2017.\n\r\nThe complete weapon system weighs a hefty 71lb when coupled to its heavy-duty tripod assembly and sans its ammunition load. This value balloons to over 100lb when the ammunition cassette is added.\n\r\nAvailable projectile types consist of 40mm \"caseless\" cartridges - these specially-designed projectiles negating the need for spent shell casings by design - combining the primer, propellant, and projectile into a single unit that is completely used up in the action. The AGS-40 fires three such types: the 7P39 High-Explosive, FRAGmentation (HE-FRAG) round, the 7P39P training round, and the 7P39U training round. The grenades are housed in a hardened circular cassette affixed to the right side of the weapon's frame. The disintegrating belt (arriving in 40-count strips) is looped over the frame and inserted into the firing chamber from the left.\n\r\nOf note is that the use of 40mm caliber is a decided departure from the long-standing reliance on 30mm grenade types common to Soviet-Russian launchers and puts this weapon more in line with offerings seen in the West.\n\r\nThe internal action involves a gas-operated piston with open-bolt component, allowing for automatic fire (5- and 10-round bursts as well as full-auto) to be achieved. Control of the weapon is through spade-type grip handles at the rear of the frame while an optional cushioned butt-plate / seat is noted, adding additional recoil-defeating value by utilizing the operator's own body weight in the firing action - this component locks into the rear two legs of the tripod (the tripod assembly itself provides some inherent recoil-dampening effects). While iron sights are supported, these are primarily retained for backup purposes as optics (typically PAG-17 2.7x magnification) aid in more precise firing down-range. The AGS-40 is capable of reaching target areas out to 2,500 meters and firing at a theoretical rate of 400 rounds-per-minute.\n\r\nThe AGS-40 began deliveries to the Russian armed forces in January 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ebcf62ad-50bf-4849-992b-b2711b79ab20", "year_model": "2022", "weapon_name": "ZALA Aero (Kalashnikov) REX-2", "weapon_type": "Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe ZALA Aero (Kalashnikov) \"REX-2\", revealed in June of 2019, is the natural follow-up \"Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System\" (C-UAS) design to the company's original (and heavier) \"REX-1\" which appeared to the public for the first time at ARMY-2017. As a counter-drone system, this relatively new Russian-originated \"weapon\" is designed to directly neutralize low-flying unmanned aircraft at the tactical level. The system is believed to be seeing active combat exposure in the ongoing Russian war with Ukraine (2022-Present).\n\r\nThe system takes on a familiar \"rifle-like\" form complete with adjustable / folding shoulder stock, integrated underslung pistol grip / trigger unit, and fore grip support component. A section of Picatinny rail is featured over the receiver for the mounting of various tactical scopes for accurized, at-range firing. A folding bipod supports the rifle when prone or behind a low-lying wall. An in-built battery pack provides the needed power to this electrically-centric system, providing operational life for up to three straight hours of use.\n\r\nThe complete system weighs just 6.6lb, making it highly man-portable for the modern infantryman use to carrying weapons of similar weight and dimension. It can operate between the 3.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz ranges as well as SNS (SATNAV / GLONASS) signals to disrupt incoming transmissions to the target drone. Once disrupted, the drone becomes uncontrollable and most likely crashes to the earth or floats about aimlessly.\n\r\nThe REX-2 can be pulled straight from its hardened transport case and readied in seconds with little preparation needed on the part of the operator.

With the widely-accepted use of the \"Designated Marksman\" in platoon / squad arrangements, the weapon has been categorized as a \"Designated Marksman Rifle\" (DMR) in modern military-speak. It retains much of the form-and-function of the original - including its rifle-caliber chambering, gas operation, and semi-automatic internal action - but has been evolved by way of various tactical finishes including broadened accessories support.\n\r\nThe SVDM is an offshoot of the earlier SVDS which was a version of the SVD rifle reworked to better suit airborne troopers requiring a more compact, lighter weight solution. As such, the stock was redesigned in skeletal / tubular form as a weight-savings measure and this entire assembly could now fold over the rifle's body along a hinge for improved transport. A heavy-duty barrel assembly was also introduced while being capped by a new, shortened flash hider.\n\r\nAs with the SVD before it, the SVDS was chambered in the proven 7.62x54mmR full-power rifle cartridge. The SVDM continues this chambering and brings along with it all of the changes introduced with the SVDS model. It has a heavy-duty barrel assembly of 21.7\" length (supporting a suppressor over the muzzle as needed) and a 1P88-4 telescopic sighting device as standard for daytime operations.\n\r\nThis incarnation of the classic SVD/SVDS rifle retains the general design lines save for it being completed in an all-black matte finish. The frame houses all pertinent operating functions including the charging handle and ejection port set to the right side. The magazine well is ahead of the more ergonomic pistol grip in the traditional way, accepting a curved, 10-round detachable form (the magazine release located just aft of the well). The pistol grip and trigger unit are set in their usual place with the trigger ring being oversized to accommodate a gloved hand. The forend is lightly slotted and shrouds most of the length of the gas assembly which sits over the barrel. The forward sight is positioned at the end of the gas cylinder and works in conjunction with a rear \"iron\" sighting device. The barrel protrudes a distance ahead and is capped by a slotted muzzle brake. A hinged, folding bipod (removable) can be affixed under the forend as a forward support.\n\r\nAt the rear of the frame is a skeletal, adjustable, and padded shoulder stock. As it is hinged, the assembly can be folded over the frame of the rifle for a more compact end-product (useful for when operating in confined spaces or for when \"on-the-march\"). Over the frame is a long-running section of Picatinny rail for the mounting of various optics, magnifiers, and aimers which can serve to enhance accuracy / precision at-range.\n\r\nOverall length of the weapon system is 44.7\" and this is brought down to 38.4\" with the stock folded.

The new gun is chambered for the proven 7.62x51mm full-powered rifle cartridge giving it good penetration-at-range.\n\r\nDuring January of 2018, the Russian military made it known that it was seeking to replace an aging stock of Cold War-era AK-74M assault systems as well as more modern AK-200/AK-12 and AK-15 assault weapons, currently in inventory which rely on a mix of calibers - complicating the logistics process for the large Russian Army and its lower departments.\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the new rifle is largely conventional with all pertinent internal working components set within the hardened, rectangular frame. As a gas-operated weapon, the adjustable gas cylinder sits over the barrel in true Kalashnikov fashion with the barrel protruding ahead and capped by a slotted brake and iron forward sighting device. A handguard protects the supporting hand from the generated heat of the barrel. The charging handle is retained along the right side of the body as is the ejection port and firing controls.

The weapon proved relatively inexpensive to produce and, perhaps more importantly, it was a robust field performer with a reliable action and easy-to-operate in the \"greenest\" of hands. As such, the AK-47 - Kalashnikov's best known and easily recognizable assault rifle - went on to be found in all parts of the world. Within time, the series was modernized with the changing era including a major facelift in the 1970s (the AK-74) and, again, in the 1990s (the composite-minded AK-100 series). The newest incarnation is the \"AK-12\" manufactured by the storied concern of Izhmash and currently (2012) undergoing evaluation by the Russian military to become the next standard-issue automatic weapon of its army. It is expected that the AK-12 will be produced through a \"family\" of automatic weapons to include the base assault rifle, a shortened carbine form, a compact submachine gun, a dedicated sniper/sharpshooter's rifle and a light machine gun consistent with prior Russian Army infantry doctrine (the AK-47/AK-74 itself was developed into varied forms to suit battlefield needs within time). The AK-12 designation marks the finalized production-ready form of the prototype AK-200 detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nWith the export market in mind and proliferation of different cartridge types around the world, the AK-12 will be an inherently modular product that, with some modification to the base internal arrangement and barrel, the weapon will be available in a variety of calibers to further suit customer requirements. Additionally, adoption of a Picatinny rail system now allows use of various non-Russian accessories including laser aimers, tactical flashlights, grips, night vision scopes, reflex sights and the like. In this way, the AK-12 system will be highly adaptable and just as highly marketable on the world stage.\n\r\nThe basic assault rifle form of the Russian Army will be chambered for the 5.45x39mm Soviet cartridge. There are two proposed NATO-standard forms in play - the 5.56x45mm NATO and 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge types. Additionally, support is expected for the 6.5mm Grendel and 7.62x39mm Soviet rounds as well. The firing action will remain consistent across all forms, however, and revolve around a proven gas-operated, long stroke piston utilizing a rotating bolt function. The AK-12 receiver will support the standard curved 30-round magazine, a 60-round AK-74-style casket or a 100-round drum (in the light machine gun role). Rate-of-fire is estimated between 600 and 1,000 rounds per minute based on configuration and cartridge size. Muzzle velocity is approximately 2,950 feet per second with an effective range out to 2,000 feet (again, depending on field conditions, selected cartridge and general weapon configuration). The AK-12 receiver will sport a more reserved ambidextrous thumb-actuated firing selector found near the pistol grip (as opposed to the traditionally large firing selector featured in AK rifles prior). The magazine release/catch will be located in its usual place behind the magazine well within easy reach. The gas cylinder will be set in its usual Kalashnikov arrangement just above the barrel assembly while the barrel will be capped by a new slotted muzzle brake. Another notable change is the relocation of the rear iron sight from the middle of the receiver top to the rear of the receiver (this will be complemented by a conventional forward iron sight just aft of the muzzle brake).  The AK-12 will be capable of semi-automatic fire, a three-round burst mode and full-automatic fire as well as the requisite safety. The charging handle will be set along the right side of the receiver as will the ejection port. Picatinny rails are noted over the top of the receiver and the sides and underside of the handguard which will allow for multiple accessories to be fitted. Overall construction of the weapon appears to be a mix of steel and plastics (steel for the major receiver portions, gas cylinder and barrel while plastics being used elsewhere to save on cost and weight).\n\r\nThe carbine version will carry the designation of AK-12U while the submachine gun will be known as the PPK-12. The sniper rifle variant will be known as the SVD-12 while the light machine gun will be assigned the designation of RPK-12. All designations are traditional in the Russian Army inventory and, should the AK-12 be accepted in number, will replace their preceding forms. All forms will also incorporated a side-folding stock and interchangeable barrel assemblies for an increased modular approach. The light machine gun will make use of a heavy duty bipod, heavier, longer barrel assembly and 100-round drum (as in the RPK-74 before it) to fulfill its dedicated battlefield role.\n\r\nThe inherent design of this automatic rifle family will make it accessible to all manner of soldier - special forces, commando, airborne infantry, basic infantry, support and logistics as well as the guerrilla fighter.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "1fff55ef-137b-46eb-b917-0b6e62b51846", "year_model": "2014", "weapon_name": "KMZ A-545", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe KMZ A-545 is a direct successor to the earlier AEK-971 line of assault rifles debuted during the latter stages of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The original design stemmed from work seen in the late-1970s and the series went on to forge for itself a stable collection of variants which went on to see combat service in the war against Chechnya. It was announced by Russian authorities in late-2014 that the A-545 would be introduced for service with select operational units during 2015 alongside the competing AK-12 series (detailed elsewhere on this site) - the eventually winner of the lucrative Russian Army contract to be announced at a later date.\n\r\nThe A-545 is chambered for the 5.45x39mm Soviet rimless cartridge and relies on a gas-operated action (the gas cylinder seated over the barrel in a Kalashnikov-type fashion). The weapon feeds from 30-round, curved detachable box magazines, sports a collapsible, twin-strut shoulder stock, and the muzzle is capped by a peculiar, multi-perforated brake. The receiver's appearance is more \"Western\" than the blocky look furnished by previous Soviet Cold War-era assault rifle offerings. Iron sights are standard fittings (front and rear) but more accurized, ranged fire can be accomplished through the mounting of optics of many types. A section of Picatinny rail is seated over the receiver for this very purpose. Smaller rail sections are also featured along the upper handguard sides to mount additional tactical accessories such as flashlights and laser aimers. The fire selector arrangement is fully ambidextrous.\n\r\nThe related A-762 is an offshoot of the same AEK-971 line but chambered for the 7.62x39mm Soviet cartridge instead.

The system is similar in function to the American \"Stinger\" series, utilizing an InfraRed (IR) homing capability to down short-ranged, low-flying aerial targets but continues the form established by the Cold War-era Igla SAM systems of the Soviet Union. The series saw service introduction in 2014 and is manufactured by KB Mashinostroyenlya who has produced it since 2011.\n\r\nThe Russian military joins Armenia and Syria in use of the 9K333 as of 2022. The product has been used to succeed the aging line of Igla-S SAM launchers in Russian service.\n\r\nMuch like the American Stinger series, the base design of the 9K333 showcases a long cylinder housing the spring-loaded finned missile. A pistol grip / trigger unit actuates the device and optics are integral. The primary operating components of the weapon are all set at the front of the system, supported by the operator's hands/arms, with the remaining tube supported by the firer's shoulder (allies best steer clear of the generated back-blast).\n\r\nThe weapon fires a missile with a triple-channel (three sensors = UV, near-IR, and mid-IR) optical seeker that can reach out to targets at an altitude of 21,000 feet. Propulsion of the missile component is by solid-fueled motor and the component is capped with a 3.3lb warhead. This solution is capable of dealing with both fixed-wing and rotary-wing threats (including unmanned drones) at range, its tactical value maximized when fired from concealment (as in an ambush action).\n\r\nBeyond its man-portable quality, the weapon can also be affixed to vehicles and naval vessels to provide point-defense capabilities against inbound aerial threats.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "de0501a6-245a-4b2a-a4c5-5802d22c9156", "year_model": "2013", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov AK-200 (AK-12)", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the conclusion of World War 2 in 1945, there has been some version of the ubiquitous Kalashnikov AK-47 circulating about the globe. In fact, the ensuing Cold War was littered with both heroes and villains, patriots and terrorists brandishing the weapon throughout countless localized, regional and global conflicts that followed. The AK-47 was a product of Soviet engineering that was highly influenced on the German wartime Sturmgewehr 44 (\"StG44\") series - known widely as the \"Father of Assault Rifles\". With a solid pedigree in place, the original AK-47 went on to see production figures numbering in the hundred millions making it one of the most commercially successful firearms of the 20th Century. Since its inception, the AK-47 has been naturally evolved to coincide with the changing times. Versions eventually featured fixed wooden stocks, folding lightweight metal stocks, composite construction, integrated grenade launchers, box and drum magazine fittings, bayonet lugs - all firing some form of Soviet cartridge - primarily the 7.62x39mm. Specialized variants ultimately became squad-level, bipod-fitted machine guns with extra ammunition capacities, shortened carbine-type paratrooper weapons and hunting/sport automatic rifles. To that end, the AK-47 was itself continually updated throughout the decades. More recent developments have become the AK-101/AK-102, AK-103/AK-104, AK-107/AK-108 marks of the 1990s, each representing modernized versions (as well as carbine forms) of the famous assault rifle. \n\r\nThe latest incarnation of the fabled line is the \"AK-200\", prototypes first unveiled in 2010, which represent a more modular approach to traditional Russian assault rifle concept. The AK-200 designation was utilized for the weapon during the prototype period and the finalized production rifle form will take on the formal designation of \"AK-12\" (detailed elsewhere on this site). Production of the AK-12 is to be handled by the long-running Izhvesk Machinebuilding Plant, popularly known as \"IZHMASH\". Production is ongoing as of this writing (2013) and began in 2011. Trials of the weapon have been ongoing since November 2012.\n\r\nModern warfare has proven that the soldier needs to adapt to the ever-changing situation on the battlefield, often times within milliseconds. Observers the world over have watched closely the developments in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other ongoing conflicts of the world, using these experiences to deliver new tools of the trade to give allied infantrymen the upper hand. As such, the new AK-200 sports widely-accepted features currently found on counterparts elsewhere, features that promote the AK-200 as a most modern \"assault\" system. Additions to the design include optional foregrips for a firm two-hand hold and various optics for accurized shooting in close-quarters fighting or at range. The system also can be fitted with a bipod for the fire suppression role. As with other Kalashnikov automatic weapons before it, the AK-200 is also designed to accept an underslung, single-shot grenade launcher for rooting out enemy elements under cover. The shoulder stock is made to be adjustable to suit the firer's requirements, a \"finesse\" quality found in many sniper rifles of the world today. Beyond traditional sighting scopes, the AK-200 will utilized a modular Picatinny-style rail system (three areas - top of the receiver, above the gas cylinder and under the forend) that will allow the operator to fit a myriad of aiming and illuminating devices as needed.\n\r\nThe AK-200 does, however retain some of the proven and popular features of AK versions before it. The weapon will be chambered for the 7.62x39mm cartridge but reports also suggest that the weapon will be convertible to suit 5.45x39mm and 5.56x45mm NATO cartridges - the latter most likely opening the AK-200 to be seen in an export guise for the foreign market. It is not out of the realm of possibility that the AK-200 will also exist in a shortened carbine form as in previous AK developments. The firing action will be the traditionally-Kalashnikov gas-operation with a rotating bolt. The weapon will be issued with the standard AK-style 30-round detachable box magazine but will also accept the \"casket-type\" 60-round box utilized in the AK-74 series.\n\r\nDesign-wise, the AK-200 maintains the basic form of the original AK-47, minus the utilitarian wood furniture. The AK-200 will, instead, make us of composites and plastics to keep operating weights at a minimum but recoil forces in check. The shoulder stock of the base production model will be \"skeletal\" for minimal weight and adjustable while the gas cylinder will still be featured over the barrel assembly - the truly defining identifier of the AK family line. The receiver will remain largely unchanged from the original AK-47 - to include the famous large cocking handle set along the right side of the body - and the curved magazine will feed conventionally ahead of the trigger unit. All told, the weapon will weigh a manageable 7.30lbs, sport a length of 37 inches and feature a 16 inch barrel. As the cartridge caliber may vary based on operator need, the barrel will be further designed as interchangeable to adapt. Rate-of-fire is listed at a healthy 800 rounds per minute which permits its use as a squad-level light machine gun (as in the American M249 SAW). Muzzle velocity is nearly 3,000 feet per second with an \"effective\" range out to 1,600 feet. Iron sights will be provided.\n\r\nin-the-field, the AK-200 should compare favorably to the latest American M16 incarnation - the similarly modular M16A4. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin - in true politician style - has already praised the new AK-200 during a scheduled visit to the IZHMASH production facility.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f74f5f72-2e3a-404e-8a07-83d8125fca0f", "year_model": "2013", "weapon_name": "KBP ADS", "weapon_type": "Amphibious Bullpup Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tIt goes without saying that special forces elements require equally-special tools for their trade. Case-in-point is the ADS \"amphibious\" assault rifle issued to underwater operatives / \"frogmen\" of the Russian military. Designed throughout the 2000s, the weapon was introduced in or around 2013 and is manufactured by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. The ADS follows other Soviet Cold War-era weapons of similar design focus (and battlefield role) - namely the SPP-1 underwater pistol and the APS underwater assault rifle, both products being detailed elsewhere on this sight.\n\r\nLike many other modern assault weapon systems, the ADS makes use of the \"bullpup\" configuration. This sets the feed mechanism and action to the rear of the gun, allowing a full-length barrel to be retained while also promoting a shorter overall length for such a service \"long gun\". Balance of the weapon is shifted, of course, and there is the running risk of a hand passing over the now-closer muzzle, but the design arrangement is proving ever-popular with tactical gun makers today with a bevy of firearms being made in this image.\n\r\nThe ADS is a true \"amphibious design\" in that it has strong performance underwater and on land. The key to the effectiveness if utilization of two different cartridges specifically designed for their role - the 5.45x39mm PSP cartridge serves the weapon when underwater and the 5.45x39mm M74 cartridge serves the weapon when on land. This is of note for earlier underwater weapons suffered from very reduced performance once on land - the cartridge switch of the ADS allows one weapon system to inherently cover two battlefield roles with no loss in performance or reduced service life of the weapon. The gun uses the standard AK-74 curved detachable box magazine carrying thirty ready-to-fire cartridges.\n\r\nThe internal action is of a proven gas-operation with rotating bolt system and a rate-of-fire of 700 rounds-per-minute is possible. Maximum firing range is 500 meters on land with basic sighting made possible with the standard iron sights. A short section of Picatinny rail over the carrying handle allows for various optics and aimers to be fitted as needed. The weapon has a muzzle velocity of 900 meters-per-second (in above-water firing). Overall weight is 4.6 kilograms with an overall length of 685mm. The barrel assembly measures 418mm long.\n\r\nBeyond the aforementioned accessories, the weapon also mounts an Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) system of 40mm caseless caliber for on-land use. The muzzle of the rifle can also accept a suppressor for clandestine work making it something of an all-in-one solution for SPECOPS personnel (including SPETSNAZ forces).\n\n\r\nThe outward design of the gun is more or less traditional with few exposed parts. The accessories rail sits atop the carrying handle. The shoulder stock is solid and has the magazine well positioned under. The pistol grip is set just ahead of the magazine with a large trigger ring for use by a gloved hand. The grenade launcher is then seated ahead of the trigger unit. The barrel sits over this fitting in the usual way. The result is a relatively compact and easy-to-handle weapon suitable for any special operative requiring the capabilities of a do-everything weapon system - taking the fight from water to land.\n\r\nThe ADS is known to be in-service with elements of Russian Naval special operations units who tested the weapon extensively prior to its adoption.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a4f50348-9f8d-4f6f-82f9-91818ef688eb", "year_model": "2012", "weapon_name": "Arsenal Firearms AF-1 (Strike One)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tAn Italian-Russian joint venture under the Arsenal Firearms brand label has introduced a new hammerless, lightweight polymer semi-automatic pistol in 2012 known as the AF-1 \"Strike One\".

These weapon systems have proven utterly reliable, effective and easy-to-operate / train on, making them a popular choice for guerilla fighters able to get their hands on the weapons.\n\r\nThe RPG-28 fits this same mold - it is a shoulder-fired weapon designed to be carried and fired by a single individual with effectiveness against armored targets and fortified positions. The launcher unit sports integrated optics for sighting targets at range and is wholly disposable once the rocket has been fired. It can be carried by a single infantryman or mounted on a tripod assembly for ambushing passing armor.

Its influence is comparable to the German Mauser at the turn of the last century which laid the framework for many of the bolt-action rifle systems of the late-1800s and early-1900s. One of the major offspring of the AK-47 model became the AK-74, which succeeded the modernized AK-47 known as the AKM, and switched to the smaller 5.45x39mm intermediate rifle cartridge. The AK-47 was then used as the framework for the Vityaz-SN, an all-modern SubMachine Gun (SMG) developed by Izhmash of Russia and currently serving as the standardized SMG of the Russian armed services as well as various police groups.\n\r\nDesign work was in the mid-2000s with production/service introduction beginning in 2008 and continuing today (2018). Currently, only Namibia is a foreign operator (marines) of this Russian SMG.\n\r\nThe Vityaz-SN retains the rectangular receiver of the AK-74 with its large fire selector handled (safety, semi- and full-automatic modes of fire settings present). The pistol grip/trigger unit (similar to the one found on the modern AK-100 series) and magazine well are all positioned in their traditional places along the frame. The barrel is shorter (measuring 9.4 inches long) to better fulfill the submachine gun role. The skeletal shoulder stock (taken from the AKS-74 model) can fold off to the side over the right side of the receiver and its hollowed out shape saves on weight. Iron sights are fitted though optics and tactical accessories (flashlights, aimers, foregrip) are easily supported through Picatinny rail sections over the receiver and optional extensions along (under, over, and the sides) the forend. The muzzle brake is slotted for added control and can be replaced by a sound suppressor for clandestine operations. The result is an effective and efficient close-quarters weapons for various infantry types - overall length becoming 27.8 inches with the stock extended and just 18.9 inches with the stock folded. Overall weight is a handy 6.40lb. Two points of contact allow for a shoulder strap to be added.\n\r\nOne of the major departures from the traditional Kalashnikov system in the Vityaz-SN is the reliance on the ubiquitous 9x19mm Parabellum German pistol cartridge - this round favored heavily by submachine gun and pistol designs of the West. Introduced in 1901, this cartridge is a proven man-stopper and available in quantity the world over. It powers the competing classic Heckler & Koch MP5 series and its offshoots still as well as many other firearms across the globe.\n\r\nInternally, the gun utilizes a proven blowback system of operation incorporating a close-bolt design (unlike the AK-74s gas-operation with rotating bolt mechanism). Rate-of-fire is 700 to 750rpm with a rated muzzle velocity of 1,245 feet-per-second and engagement ranges out to 220 yards. The weapon feeds from a 30-round detachable box magazine inserted into a well positioned just ahead of the trigger unit (a special component allows magazines to be paired, side-by-side for faster reloading). Both the trigger and safety systems are both taken from the AK-74 as is the return spring/guide rod section.\n\r\nVariants of the Vityaz-SN line include the Version 10 and Version 20 models.

It succeeded the ages-old Makarov pistol as standard issue. Criticized for its all-steel construction (adding to its overall weight) and general reliability when compared to proven products like Glock, the MP-443 is nonetheless a powerful handgun and most notable for its firing of an armor-piercing, body-armor-defeating cartridge. During its trial phase, the MP-443 was designated as the \"6P35\". It has since been known as the \"PYa\" as well.\n\r\nThe sidearm is manufactured out of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant and its design stems from Vladimir Yarygin.\n\r\nOrigins of the Grach stem from a 1993 Russian military requirement seeking to replace the limited-capacity Makarov series pistol which saw widespread adoption by military, governmental, special forces and police units. The requirement called for a Double-Action (DA) trigger system and a high-capacity 17-round magazine (an 18-round magazine was introduced in 2004). The all-steel construction was part of the original makeup of the gun and chamberings requested included 9x19mm Parabellum, 9x18mm Makarov and 7.62x25mm Tokarev. The MP-443 followed through on these qualities and settled on the 9x19mm 7N21 +P+ (a 9mm NATO equivalent) pistol cartridge as its primary round.\n\r\nThe action used is the short-recoil (with locked breech) arrangement and sights are fixed out to 50 meters. The sighting combination pairs a front blade with 3-dot reach notch, all fixed. All other mechanical functions of the sidearm are conventional with the slide lock, safety and magazine release all located in their usual positions along the frame of the gun. Magazines are inserted into the base of the grip handle in the usual way.\n\r\nIntroduction of the MP-443 series was agonizingly slow and first occurred with specialist Russian troops around 2008. Serious quantitative production was seen in 2011 leading to increased widespread service of the pistol from 2012 onward.\n\r\nSince its formal introduction, the MP-443 has seen several civilian-market developments appear lead by the MP-446 \"Viking\" model.  This maintains much of the form and function of the military version but does not support firing of armor-piercing cartridges. The MP-446C is an offshoot with a 10-round magazine limit. The MP-353 fires rubber bullets and is classified as a \"non-lethal\" pistol. The MP-472 follows suit as a non-lethal pistol development.\n\r\nBeyond Russia, the Grach pistol line has been adopted by private firms in Kazakhstan (2007).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a652f5c7-bdf8-404b-b1fc-9c0add8b43de", "year_model": "2008", "weapon_name": "RPG-30", "weapon_type": "Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the dark days of World War 2, Russia (then the lead of the Soviet Union) has held a high regard for man-portable, tank-killing systems. The various developments encountered by German tankers during the conflict spanned from grenades and high-powered mines to anti-material rifles and dedicated direct-fire field guns. In 1949, the world-famous line of \"Rocket-Propelled Grenade\" (RPG) launchers was born in the \"RPG-2\", these effectively highly-portable, shoulder-fired recoilless rifles designs. The improved (and definitive) \"RPG-7\" then proliferated a multitude of Soviet-supported states and allies during the Cold War. The line has since been modernized with the addition of the \"RPG-30\" mark of 2008 and other similar anti-tank systems originating from Bazalt. The weapon was both designed and developed by Bazalt (State Research and Production Enterprise) which also handles its production.\n\r\nThe RPG-30 utilizes the same basic RPG concept established decades ago by the original RPG-2. The weapon is differentiated from the similar (and modern) Bazalt \"RPG-27\"  by its implementation of a launched decoy projectile preceding the main projectile and intended to foil any \"Active Protection System\" (APS) scheme being applied by the target vehicle (a defense mechanism popular amongst major armored vehicles today). Design of the RPG-30 consists of a single-shot, disposable  launch tube that is man-portable and weighs in the vicinity of 10 kilograms. A single operator can, therefore, manage several RPG-30 launchers across the back for transport, a sight common to RPG-7 operators today. The RPG-30 houses a 105mm armor- / structure-defeating rocket grenade with a tandem shaped-charge warhead capable of penetration out to 200 meters. As such, the system can be utilized to engage all manner of \"hard\" targets in the field at range.\n\r\nThe RPG-32 (also by Bazalt) is a further evolution of the RPG line, introduced in 2008 and, at present, operated by Brazil, Jordan, Lebanon, Mexico and Russia. However, the RPG-32 makes use of a reusable launch tube firing a 105mm rocket grenade as opposed to the disposable nature of the RPG-30 series.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a9e8fb7e-8bd3-4bd2-818d-2e01fc747702", "year_model": "2008", "weapon_name": "RPG-32 (Hashim)", "weapon_type": "72mm/105mm Rocket Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tAt the start of the new millennium, the governments of Jordan and Mexico commissioned the Russian government-run bureau of Bazalt to design and develop a modern armor-defeating, anti-tank measure with penetration capabilities against reinforced concrete targets. The result was the \"RPG-32\" based on the existing RPG-29. Russia has long held an expertise with inexpensive anti-tank devices going as far back as World War 2 during their bloody conflict with Germany and the Axis powers. The RPG-32 became, in many ways, a culmination of the many successes of previous designs which included the world-renowned RPG-7 (which Bazalt continues to produce). The RPG-32 entered service in 2008 and is utilized by the armies of Iraq, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The \"Hashim\" designator sometimes seen is applied by the Jordanian Army in reference to the Arab Hashemite dynasty of centuries past. Jordan supplied initial financing of the RPG-32 initiative and its engineers played a role in the final design.\n\r\nAt its core, the RPG-32 is a rocket-propelled grenade launcher in much the same vein as the RPG-7 before it though featuring a much lighter launcher and more capable rocket element. The system consists of the launch tube which, in itself, integrates the optics and trigger mechanism. The rocket grenade is provided through a pre-fabricated casing that is inserted at the rear of the tube prior to firing. The optical sight is managed from the left side of the launch tube with the trigger unit along the right. As with the earlier RPG developments, little preparation is required to make the RPG-32 ready and little training is required in its use - making it popular amongst many operators. The RPG-32 launcher is of 105mm caliber though it can fire from an ammunition stock of both 105mm (15.4lbs) and 72mm rocket types. There are two recognized rockets available - the \"PG-32V\" tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) and the \"TBG-32V\" Thermobaric Fragmentation Anti-Armor (TFAA). The former is listed with a penetration up to 650mm (25 inches) and a muzzle velocity of 460 feet per second with an effective range out to 2,300 feet. Rockets are delivered from the factory in a disposable case which is affixed to the rear of the reusable launch tube.\n\r\nThe RPG-32 is said to be capable of defeating the base armor of present-day Main Battle Tanks while the warhead is suitable against other target types including fortified structures. The launcher is purposely designed to be man-portable and is fired from the shoulder in the usual way. Firing from within buildings is, of course, restricted to an extent due to the violent back-blast of such weapons in confined spaces. Launchers weigh 3 kilograms (sans projectile) and their value is limited only by the ammunition supply on hand. Common practice is an RPG carrier with 3 x rocket grenades in a specially-devised backpack alongside his primary automatic weapon. As the projectile is a true \"rocket grenade\" and not a homing/guided missile, the projectile is essentially a \"point-and-shoot\" weapon without any guidance provided to the rocket after launch. This helps to keep procurement costs down substantially while providing for a very modern armor-penetrating system for discerning customers. According to company sources, a single launcher is rated for the firing of 200 rockets.\n\r\nIt is believed that local license production of the launchers and rockets are handled in Argentina, Brazil, Jordan and Mexico. Such manufacture of a local solution was one of the initial project goals concerning the RPG-32.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "1c5f8f6d-c0a3-43c0-9243-199ec4458ba8", "year_model": "2006", "weapon_name": "Heckler & Koch HK 417", "weapon_type": "Battle Rifle / Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe HK 417 began as a privately-funded company venture intended to supply US special forces with a modular battlefield weapons system. The HK 417 model shares a visual and functional similarity to the previous Heckler & Koch offering, the HK 416, which itself was developed to compete with the M4 carbine and M16 assault rifles of the regular army. While the HK 416 is chambered for the widely-accepted 5.56mm cartridge, the HK 417 makes use of the traditional rifle-caliber 7.62x51mm NATO standard cartridge. Despite the HK 417 still being in its final development phase officially, it has already been fielded in an operational role with US special forces in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters.\n\r\nThe HK 417 retains much of the form and function of the preceding HK 416 series and, as such, showcases several of the same integral components and functionality. Like the HK 416 before it - and the HK G36 before that - the HK 417 makes use of a \"pusher\" rod-based gas system assembly over that of the traditional \"hollow\" gas cylinder common to conventional gas-operated assault systems. HK markets this feature as improved reliability over the life of the weapon as well as lower maintenance requirements and extended service life. During testing, the HK 417 and HK 416 have been put through their paces through the firing of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The overall project commitment has been in developing a weapon system with a supremely low rate of failure and - to date - it seems that HK has succeeded in that respect.\n\r\nOutwardly, the HK 417 sports a fine clean and modern design look. The receiver is well laid out and constructed of both lightweight polymers and metals - a fine balance needed to produce a lightweight weapon that is also a manageable firing platform. The charging handle is set to the right side of the body as is the ejection port in typical HK fashion. The trigger unit is integrated to the lower receiver and attached to the pistol grip. The magazine feeds into a port just ahead of the trigger unit. The firing selector switch is located along both sides of the receiver making the weapon semi-ambidextrous. Firing modes include a safety, semi-automatic fire and full-automatic fire. The stock is tubular in its basic design and adjustable/collapsible, capped with a rubber pad for some comfort. The HK 417, like other modern rifle designs, makes use of Picatinny rail systems for the implementation of optics and accessories. A rail system is prominently featured across the top of the receiver and continued over the forend. The sides of the forend are also accessories-friendly. Another accessories rail is found under the forend which broadens the tactical applications of the HK 417. Iron sights are standard at the rear of the receiver and at the extreme end of the forend. Optics can quickly change the tactical nature of the HK 417 into that of a designated marksman's semi-automatic sniper rifle. The barrel protrudes ahead of the forend shroud and is capped by a slotted muzzle brake. The barrel is constructed of cold hammer forged steel and is chrome-lined for excessive wear and tear with conventional rifling therein. An optional single-shot grenade launcher can be affixed to the lower forend.\n\r\nHK plans on eventually marketing their 417 in a variety of barrel lengths to fully broaden the customer interest base. The series intends to feature 12-, 16- and 20-inch barrel lengths which will turn the HK 417 from carbine to assault rifle to marksman rifle in minutes. The short form is known as the \"Recce\" while the basic form is the \"Assaulter\". The long form is the \"Sniper\". Additionally, only basic tools will be needed to change out the barrel assembly. The rail systems will also be easily removable and these without the need for tools or even \"zeroing\" the weapon after reinstallation of accessories.\n\r\nTo date, testing of the HK 417 has ensured zero-failure rates after some 15,000 rounds of ammunition were fired. Beyond consideration given by the United States military, the HK 417 is also tied to the militaries of Albania, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "27363691-b191-4232-8dfa-ea70b17e5093", "year_model": "2006", "weapon_name": "KBP GM-94", "weapon_type": "Multi-Shot, Pump-Action Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe KBP GM-94 is a modern, multi-shot tactical grenade launcher of Russian origin, developed with special forces units such as SPETZNAZ in mind. The weapon provides considerable firepower at the squad level, allowing engagement of direct and indirect targets at both close- and medium-ranges. The system is produced by KBP Instrument Design Bureau of Tula, Russia.\n\r\nThe GM-94 is arranged as a conventional firearm with a standalone pistol grip with trigger unit, shoulder stock, receiver, barrel and magazine. The trigger ring is large enough to allow for a gloved hand to be used. The weapon's overall arrangement follows that of a conventional pump-action shotgun in that the barrel is mated to a tubular magazine holding the grenade projectiles. However, the AN-94 features the magazine over the barrel (as opposed to under) with loading of the weapon managed through a hinged gate found at the top of the receiver (again, as opposed to under). Up to three 43mm projectiles can be stored in the magazine with a fourth projectile made \"ready-to-fire\" in the chamber below. The GM-94 is fielded with a basic steel skeletal shoulder stock that conveniently folds over the receiver for a more compact form when traveling or when forced to action in confined spaces. The folded shoulder stock also doubles as an ad hoc carrying handle when on the march. The barrel is surrounded by a noticeably ribbed casing which provides the forward horizontal grip position while acting as the needed pump-action slide facility. Sighting is through standard fittings across the top of the receiver with a flip-type rear. The weapon weighs in at 4.8 kilograms  and, with a full four-round load, 5.8 kilograms. It is finished in an overall non-reflective black coating.\n\r\nIn practice, the GM-94 is a very portable, lightweight system affording its operator an effective engagement range of 300 meters and maximum engagement range out to 500 meters. Base grenades project a lethal kill radius of 3 meters which safeguards the operator, especially in confined spaces, where the GM-94 allows engagement of a target or area from as little as 10 meters away. The weapon has proven very robust to date and can be fired from wet or dry conditions. Additionally, the availability of various grenade types allows the launcher to be utilized by military and law enforcement elements, the latter by way of tear gas rounds, bean bag slugs and other \"less-than-lethal\" projectiles. For military service, various grenade types are available which provide tactical flexibility against all manner of targets - personnel in close-quarters, dug-in foes and even lightly armored vehicles. However, the system does showcase some detractions including its rather cumbersome size which precludes the operator from having his primary weapon trained at the same time (compared to an underslung launcher fitting). Additionally, there is a considerable amount of recoil noted in the action during firing especially when compared to the smaller 40mm launcher types favored by the West.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4df7d570-9eba-4525-b302-f0ef22175020", "year_model": "2006", "weapon_name": "KBP PP-2000", "weapon_type": "Submachine Gun (SMG / Machine Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tIn 2004, KBP Instrument Design Bureau unveiled an all-new Russian-originated submachine gun in the \"PP-2000\". Production ensued in 2006 and the type has since been adopted by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and some police forces across Russia. The weapon's compact size and its pistol-caliber cartridge make the PP-2000 also suitable as a machine pistol. It may also be in use with the famous SPETSNAZ Russian special forces teams.\n\r\nThe PP-2000 makes use of the widely accepted German 9x19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge and fired through a tried-and-true straight blowback system of operation. Overall weight is a handy 3lbs with overall length reaching 22 inches. A folding stock reduces length to a more manageable 13.4 inches and an optional carrying strap eases transport. Rate-of-fire reaches 600 to 800 rounds per minute with an effective firing range out to 100 meters (engagement at around 200 meters is possible when using \"overpressure\" ammunition). Feeding is by way of a 20- or 44-round detachable box magazine fitted into the base of the pistol grip. The center placement of the magazine well, within the grip handle, allows for a more balanced approach similar in scope to the famous Israeli UZI. The grip handle is well-contoured and a thick, solid structural trigger loop is integrated around a large-area opening which aids in operation of the weapon by a gloved hand. The barrel is of a short-length design and capped by a slotted flash suppressor. The overall receiver shape is very unique, making use of clean straight lines generating somewhat irregular shapes. Sighting is through a front post/rear notch arrangement and optics/aimers/accessories can be added by way of the included MIL-STD-1913 rail section over the receiver. The lower portion of the trigger loop structure can also support mounting of tactical lights and laser aimers. The cocking handle is set aft of the front sight and is foldable by design, tucked away when not used.\n\r\nSuch weapons are specifically designed for quick-reaction access and portability in confined spaces and have proven popular with military and security groups alike. A high-capacity magazine allows the weapon to bring voluminous fire to any engagement. In addition to the traditional 9x19mm bullet, the PP-2000 also supports an armor-piercing bullet variety which can be used on suspects wearing body armor.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f8a0d0b0-65f9-4d10-a1a5-14ef1cb943e1", "year_model": "2004", "weapon_name": "Izhmash AK-9", "weapon_type": "Silenced Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AK-9 assault rifle is yet another Kalashnikov-related series firearm that can trace its roots back to the original AK-47 of the 1940s. In the early 1990s, the AK series was modernized to include weight-saving features such as plastics and developed into both assault rifle and carbine forms. The AK-9 addition is related to this reimagining of the fine AK-47 but is highly differentiated from the newer AK-100 series models by use of the subsonic 9x39mm cartridge. As such, the AK-9 is an inherently suppressed weapon system intended for special forces groups and the like. The long-running fabled Soviet-Russian firm of Izhmash is primarily responsible for the design and development of the intriguing AK-9. The assault rifle was specifically developed to a Russian military requirement handed down in 2006.\n\r\nOutwardly, the AK-9 actually shares much in common with the Kalashnikov family of AK assault rifles seen down the decades of history. There is a solid stock, pistol grip and rectangular receiver. The forend is decided Kalashnikov with its two-piece guard covering the over-barrel gas cylinder and low set barrel assembly. Magazines are conventionally entered in through the forward bottom side of the receiver. Optics can be affixed to the top of the receiver for accurized firing while iron sights are dutifully provided for back up purposes. The keen physical defining feature of the AK-9 is its use of an integrated silencer assembly over the barrel which makes sound suppression possible (along with its subsonic ammunition). The firing action consists of the tried and proven gas-operated, rotating bolt common to many other automatic weapons - including the whole AK family line. The AK-9 exhibits a running overall length of 34.7 inches with a barrel length of 8 inches. Weight with the suppressor installed is a manageable 8.4lb.\n\r\nThe heart and soul of the AK-9 system is its 9x39mm cartridge. The cartridge is essentially that of the Russian 7.62x39mm rifle caliber round though its neck is widened to fit the 9mm submachine gun/pistol round. The cartridge originated in the 1980s and has since proven vital to Russian suppressed firearms used primarily by special forces. As a whole, the 9x39 cartridge comes off with an appearance more akin to a fattened 7.62x39mm cartridge. The resulting design is a proven man-stopper with a low velocity that, while extremely limiting effectively ranges, does not produce excessive sound energy. Therefore, the 9x39mm subsonic cartridge is limited to ranges under 400 meters. Regardless, special forces will traditional operate at close ranges to begin with so the limitation - for the sake of stealth - is negligible. According to Russian engineers, the low velocity does not impede penetration capabilities. The AK-9 makes use of a 20-round detachable box magazine.\n\r\nAK-9 engineers claim that the AK-9 can pierce the latest bulletproof armor and is nearly silent in its operation - allowing Russian special forces the ability to shoot their way in and out of trouble spots or dispense sentries with relatively little commotion. The AK-9 is believed to have been designed at the turn of the decade and introduced sometime in or around 2007 or later.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c27c52f0-a5ce-40b5-a3d5-a71aecbfecae", "year_model": "2004", "weapon_name": "RPC FOrt Fort-17", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Service Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPC Fort Fort-17 pistol is a modern military/police sidearm designed, developed, and produced in Ukraine and currently operated by the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is a largely conventional semi-automatic pistol constructed of composites and metal with an integral trigger ring, over-receiver slide, and pistol grip magazine well. It entered notable service in 2004 and has seen combat exposure in the current War in Donbass against Russian elements and separatists.\n\r\nThe gun is manufactured locally by state-owned RPC Fort, founded in 1991 and headquartered in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. Production is ongoing as of this writing (2020).\n\r\nThe pistol is typically seen and operated through the widely-available 9mm chambering, a proven man-stopped the world over and making for a more manageable sidearm in terms of accuracy. The internal action is of Double-Action (DA), semi-automatic function, allowing one pull/squeeze of the trigger to fire the gun and introduce a new cartridge into the chamber while ejecting the spent case. During this quick action, the slide is managed rearwards and resets over the receiver in the usual way. Feeding is by way of a 13-round spring-loaded detachable box magazine fitted into the hollowed out grip. Muzzle velocity is rated at 325 meters-per-second. Overall length reaches 180mm with the barrel measuring 95mm. Weight is 810 grams loaded (680 grams otherwise).\n\r\nSights are set over the receiver, one component at the rear and the other nearer the muzzle for approximate placement of the bullet at range. The slide features ribbing along its sides for a surer grip when managing the slide assembly manually (such as in the initial cocking action). A safety mechanism is set at the slide towards the rear (near the thumb) and the exposed hammer protrudes from the rear of the assembly. The magazine-release button is situated near the trigger, giving quick access to the system for reloading, while the trigger itself sits within an uninterrupted ring which is oversized to accommodate a gloved hand. The grip's backstrap is removable/replaceable for some customization of the pistol.\n\r\nThe Fort-17 family line currently (2020) includes the base design as the \"Fort-17\". This model is chambered in the 9x18mm PM (Makarov) pistol cartridge. The Fort-17 Curz uses the 9mm \"Kurz\" (.380 ACP) cartridge while the \"Kobra\" is a sport shooter utilizing the Makarov catridge. The \"Kordon\" follows as another sporting entry but chambered in .22 Long Rifle and firing from a 10-round detachable box magazine. The Fort-17R and Fprt-17T are ant-riot variants firing rubber bullets for crowd control.\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs is the largest global operator of this pistol series. Fewer numbers have also been sold to local police forces and security elements. In 2014, the series was officially taken on by the Ukrainian Army.\n\r\nDespite Ukraine being at war with Russia,the Fort-17 made its way to Russia prior to the War in Donbass as it was openly exported until the middle of 2011. As such, some of these pistols have been used against the host country during the fighting that remains ongoing.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c0e23c98-d40f-4ddb-9c4d-d4bb1f7d47be", "year_model": "2004", "weapon_name": "SA-24 (Grinch) / 9K338 Igla-S", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe culmination of missile design work by Soviet engineers in the 1950s and 1960s became the 9K338 \"Igla-S\" (NATO: SA-24 \"Grinch\") man-portable, shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile of 2004. The path was evolved through the preceding 9K32, 9K32M, 9K34, 9K310, 9K38 and 9K310 marks throughout the Cold War decades and into the new millennium. As was the case with the previous marks, the 9K338 series is built upon new systems that are designed to resist modern countermeasures. The 9K338 makes use of the improved \"Igla-S\" missile.\n\r\nAs with the previous line of shoulder-launched Soviet-Russian originated missile systems, the 9K338 features a slim launch tube housing the missile, integrated optics and guidance and a trigger with grip unit. Night vision is standard with each 9K338 unit. The newer missile features a heavier and more potent warhead for maximized damage capabilities while sporting a contact and timed fuse with increased engagement ranges. The warhead is of High-Explosive Fragmentation (HE-FRAG) and weighs 2.5 kilograms. Guidance is through IR-homing with engagement ranges between 500 meters and 6,000 meters. The 9K338 is a line-of-sight weapon requiring the target and operator to have a clean line of vision between them.

These weapons typically fire a large-caliber round: .50 BMG, 12.7mm, 14.5mm and even 20mm projectiles are used in various designs throughout the world. In 2004, Steyr Mannlicher of Austria introduced the HS.50 series AMR aimed at forces already centered on a Western=minded caliber type - the .50 BMG (Browning Machine Gun).\n\r\nUnlike other mainstream AMRs, which largely rely on a semi-automatic action feeding cartridges from a detachable box magazine, the HS.50 originally utilized a manual-action bolt system tied to an integral magazine. It has since been marketed with a five-round detachable box magazine feature (through the HS.50 M1 model). All other aspects of the weapon remain traditional - adjustable shoulder stock, folding bipod assembly, oversized slotted muzzle brake, and an over-receiver optics set (Picatinny rail).

This allows a full-length barrel to be used while promoting a slightly more compact overall length when compared to traditional long guns. The rifle fires the massive 12.7x55mm STs-130 cartridge which is highly suitable against \"soft\" targets (such as enemy infantry, even if clad in body armor) and lightly-armored vehicles. Additionally, the rifle has the power to knock out individual exposed systems on deadlier battlefield vehicles such as Main Battle Tanks (MBTs).\n\r\nThe STs-130 cartridge also appeared in 2002 and forged from the .338 Lapua Magnum rifle cartridge already in existence. The case measures 2.1\" in length which, with the 0.50\" bullet, makes for a 3.7\" long cartridge. The same cartridge is used in another Russian gun - the ASh-12.7 bullpup \"battle rifle\". Several variants of the base cartridge design have appeared since introduction.\n\r\nThe VKS is manually-operated by way of a bolt-action lever system. Each round, fed from a detachable 5-round box magazine under the shoulder stock, is individually led into the chamber by the action whilst any spend casing is ejected in a single, fluid motion by the operator. The weapon has a smooth frame and exterior black finish, cleared of many obstructions and protrusions.

There is growing interest in the style of close assault weapon today and several global players have risen to meet the demand for a heavy-minded repeat-fire system that goes beyond the capabilities of traditional pump-slide action designs. The Vepr-12 is a Russian-originated semi-automatic shotgun offered by Molot Oruzhie Limited and is based on the tried-and-true Kalashnokov pattern while being influenced heavily by the successful RPK series of machine guns (detailed elsewhere on this site). Introduced in 2003, the Vepr-12 serves with Russia and is available in several variants to suit military and civilian market demand. Greek special police have also taken up the type.\n\r\nExternally, the Vepr-12 clearly showcases its Kalashnikov-based roots through its rectangular receiver design, over-barrel gas cylinder mounting and support for curved detachable magazines. Sections of Picatinny rail are seen over the receiver and at the gas cylinder allowing for the fitting of various tactical accessories. The barrel assembly protrudes a distance ahead of the gas cylinder and is capped by a unique, multi-slotted brake. The shoulder stock is adjustable to suit operator need and collapsible for a more compact footprint. The pistol grip and trigger unit are positioned in their traditional place along the underside of the receiver with the magazine well found just ahead. Operational controls are found within easy reach of the trigger area.\n\r\nInternally the Vepr-12 follows the Kalashnikov pattern gas-operated system with rotating bolt function. This gives reliable service even under the most extreme of battlefield abuses. The weapon is chambered for the 18.5x70mm (12 gauge) shell and also supports firing of 12 Gauge Magnum rounds.

However, throughout the 1980s, body armor technology allowed users wider access to lighter - yet still effective - protection which inspired new breeds of cartridge - and corresponding weapons - to take shape. NATO saw a similar need and issued a 1989 charge for such a cartridge, prompting several competing firearms firms to develop new solutions.\n\r\nOne submission became the Heckler & Koch HK MP7 chambered for the HK 4.6x30mm cartridge. The HK firm of Germany had long held a lead in the submachine gun market, their HK MP5 submachine gun (chambered in 9mm) becoming its ubiquitous product line. the HK MP7 followed the tried and proven measures that made the MP5 such a successful weapon including use of heavy duty composites and attention to design. However, the MP7 would be keenly different from the preceding MP5 design for it was intended to function as a machine pistol, submachine gun and \"personal defense weapon\" (PDW) all in one. Therefore, it could be issued to special forces operatives, paratroopers (airborne soldiers), security personnel, police units and second-line/logistical troops without loss of firepower.\n\r\nThe HK MP7 is, therefore, very compact and can be utilized in a traditional three-point hold (two-handed and up against the shoulder) or a standard two-hand hold as with a pistol. The weapon is relatively light-weight at 2.6lbs unloaded and maintains a running length of 25 inches. Utilizing the collapsing stock, the weapon can be brought down to a more manageable 16 inch length when space is a luxury. The barrel itself measures in at 7 inches while the receiver, at its thickest, is just 2 inches wide.\n\r\nThe key design element of the HK MP7 is the proprietary HK 4.6x30mm cartridge. The cartridge was first introduced in 1999 and began widespread use in 2001 is of a rimless bottleneck design. Its design is such that the cartridge offers very little recoil yet can still penetrate armored subjects at range - the smaller diameter being the driving quality here. Since its inception, the cartridge had evolved into a family of solutions including the basic penetrator, a hollow point offering, and a full metal jacket design. The HP MP7 is the only weapon that currently makes use of the HK 4.6x30mm cartridge aside from the cancelled HK UCP pistol. All told, the HK MP7 and UCP were direct competitors to the Belgian FN-Herstal FN P90 submachine gun and Five-Seven pistol - these chambered for the proprietary 5.7x28mm cartridge.\n\r\nHK utilized the action of their successful HK G36 assault rifle in the HK MP7, this being a gas-operation system utilizing a short-stroke piston with a rotating bolt assembly. The prototype was known as the PDW (Personal Defense Weapon) and debuted in 1999. After a period of evaluation, it entered serial production under the company designation of HK MP7 in 2001.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "fc73d02b-fac1-4c23-9fad-56246014ffa9", "year_model": "2001", "weapon_name": "PKP Pecheneg (6P41)", "weapon_type": "General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tIn 1961, the Soviet Army began wide-scale adoption of the PK General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) which utilized the tried-and-true 7.62mm Russian rifle cartridge through a belt-fed mechanism and gas-operated system. It was adopted beyond the Soviet realm by political and military allies to become a permanent, and rather lethal, fixture in the wars to follow - Vietnam, Yom Kippur, Iran-Iraq, the Chechen wars among others. Amazingly, the PK family line has withstood the test of time to remain in wide-reaching use today and has since been modernized through the \"PKM\" form.\n\r\nAt the turn of the century, the Russian military began evaluation of a new, modernized machine gun form intended to serve in the squad-level role. As such, the design would become highly portable and intended for true suppression effect. The design was headed by TsNIITochMash and the weapon came to be known as the PKP \"Pecheneg\". It was then formally adopted for frontline use in 2001. Granted the military designation of 6P41, it has since seen service with the Russian Army and SPETSNAZ special forces while adopted in varying degrees by Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\r\nAt its core, the PKP remains a gas-operated machine gun system capable of full-automatic fire while being fed by way of 100-, 200- or 250-round belt magazines held in a hard box under the receiver. It retains use of the same 7.62x54R cartridge seen in the PK/PKM and features a rate-of-fire reaching 600 to 800 rounds-per-minute. Muzzle velocity is 2,700 feet per second while effective firing ranges reach out to 1,500 meters.\n\r\nOutwardly, the PKP showcases a workmanlike appearance with a solid, rectangular receiver in an all-black finish. The receiver naturally houses the critical internal working components of the action including the feed mechanism and firing chamber. There is a lightweight, skeletal stock for support at the shoulder and the barrel sits above the gas cylinder at front. Iron sights are provided though optics can be affixed as required. An integrated carrying handle is useful for quick relocation of the unit. A standard fixture at the barrel is a folding bipod assembly. Sling loops allow a shoulder strap to be used which is a must for quick-moving infantry. An ergonomic pistol grip handle and easy-reach trigger group provide a familiar operational functionality to the weapon. Unlike other GPMGs, the PKP does not feature a \"quick-change\" barrel facility for in-the-field management of a hot barrel. Instead, the assembly is designed with a forced-air, air-cooled arrangement.\n\r\nOverall weight of the PKP (with its bipod affixed) is approximately 8.7 kilograms. It features an overall length of 47 inches while the barrel assembly measures some 26 inches long. When affixed with a night vision device, the 6P41 becomes known as the \"6P41N Pecheneg-N\". Other designations include the Pecheneg \"Bullpup\" which is a reworked form to the bullpup configuration, retaining its full-length barrel and containing the action/magazine feed to the rear of the trigger group. The Pecheneg-2 is considered an \"improved\" based on the original Pecheneg model and is currently (2014) in the development phase.\n\r\nThe PKP has recently seen combat actions in the Russian takeover of Crimea by Army and special forces elements.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "7ced3ed6-ca5a-48da-93f9-98db7a1e471f", "year_model": "2000", "weapon_name": "ASM-DT (AAR)", "weapon_type": "Amphibious Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe ASM-DT was developed as a combination assault rifle / underwater weapon to serve specialist Russian forces (these elements known as \"frogmen\"). The practice of underwater weapons is not a new one to Russian special forces for, during the latter half of the Cold War, Soviet operatives relied on the APS \"Underwater Assault Rifle\" which appeared in 1975. The weapon was a large, cumbersome system but became a proven underwater weapon. Its dual nature design also allowed for firing on land though its smoothbore barrel and dart-like projectile suffered accuracy. Additionally, barrel wear was drastically increased. Instead, operatives began favoring the earlier \"SPP-1\" underwater pistol series for underwater work and carried their trusty Kalashnikov AK-74 assault rifles for surface work - the obvious detriment being that operatives were now forced to carry two weapons into battle.\n\r\nDue to the limitations of the APS line, there was a long standing requirement for a truer dual-purpose weapon that offered equal lethality whether used underwater or on land. Design work on a new weapon to fulfill this requirement fell to Professor Yuri Danilov who, throughout the 1990s, devised an all-new approach to meet the requirement. It was decided to provide the new weapon with a dual-feed system in which one feed accepted the Soviet 5.45x39mm cartridge (as in the AK-74 rifle) for land-based work and the other feed accepted the 5.45x39mm MGTS projectile for underwater firing. The underwater projectile utilized a dart-like body for basic piercing and was originally developed by Vladimir Simonov for the preceding APS rifle. In the earlier gun, the barrel could be forged as smoothbore but it was this quality that led to reduced accuracy for surface actions. The new weapon - christened as \"ASM-DT\" - was given a rifled barrel to suit both underwater and out of the water action with the barrel featuring specially designed channels to help drainage for land-based firing. A typical gas-operated/rotating bolt action was used for both ammunition types regardless of firing environment.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "564f497f-67b3-4d4e-a484-dbdb7954355c", "year_model": "2000", "weapon_name": "KBP GSh-18", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Military / Security Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tIn the world of modern semi-automatic handguns, the buyer has a plethora of options built atop a proven framework that evolved from designs appearing prior to the First World War (1914-1918).

Since 2001, the gun has been in serial production under the KBP Instrument Design Bureau and counts operators in both Russia and Syria. For the former, the type is in service with the Russian military, internal security, and law enforcement.\n\r\nAt its core, the pistol is of largely conventional design, relying on the proven short recoil principle and featuring a rotating barrel with striker firing. The pistol grip is hollowed out to accept the double-stacked, 18-round, spring-loaded magazine and is integrated to the trigger ring - which is oblong to better accept a gloved hand. The trigger also sports a trigger-block safety mechanism. The slide runs the length of the pistol and sports forward and rear sighting devices (fixed front blade with rear notch) as well as ribbing near the rear (for managing the slide). Overall length is 7.2 inches while the barrel measures 4.1 inches long. Weight is 590 grams. Polymer and steel is used throughout its construction.\n\r\nThe pistol is available in chamberings of 9x19mm Parabellum, 9x19mm 7N21 +P+, and 9x19mm 7N31 +P+. The former is the long-running, proven German pistol round while the latter two offerings are Russian-originated pistol cartridges specifically used for armor-piercing.\n\r\nMuzzle velocity reaches 1,755 feet-per-second.\n\r\nQualities include a reversible magazine release to rearrange the gun for left-handed shooters, minimal amount of parts making up the gun, and guide vanes integrated to the forward section of the barrel assembly. The magazine floorplate is used to manage the slide catch and break the weapon down into just seventeen individual parts - nearly half fewer than competing European and American semi-automatics. The same method is used to remove the breechblock.\n\r\nThe gun is provided with its own case, a cleaning rod, magazine loader, additional spring, and spare magazine. Variants currently (2020) include the base GSh-18 model, the Tactical which features a Picatinny rail section (supporting various accessories) and can take on a barrel suppressor,  Sport and Sport 2 in ten- and eighteen-round configurations for civilian-market sport shooting, and the GSh-18T which fires rubber bullets for riot control.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "aa506b78-0cf2-4691-9250-e453429f7d0c", "year_model": "2000", "weapon_name": "SAKO TRG (Series)", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tTRG designates a family of proven, purpose-built bolt-action sniper rifles showcased by gunmaker SAKO, Limited of Riihimaki, Finland. The initial models appeared in 1989 and the line has gone on to see continued production today (2015). It has been featured by coalition sniper elements during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. At its core, it is a sound, precision-minded, reliable sniping platform which has found a plethora of military and police customers willing to stake reputations on this fine Finnish-originated product.\n\r\nAs a bolt-action rifle, the TRG series requires the operator to operate the bolt handle to clear the firing chamber of spent shell casings and introduce a fresh cartridge from the awaiting 5-, 7-, or 10-round detachable box magazine. Sighting is either through an iron arrangement or (more typical) through mounted optics set over the receiver in the usual way. Day and night optics are both supported for day or low-light-level work. Effective ranges (depending on rifle model and cartridge in play) reach out to 800 meters and 1,500 meters. The heavyweight barrel and receiver are both cold forged for strength and longevity while the barrel is capped by a combination muzzle brake / flash hider (this can also be substituted with a sound suppressor for clandestine work against high-value targets at range). The stock is constructed of synthetics as a weight-savings measure and the shoulder section features an adjustable design offering a relatively high degree of customizability for the shooter. It can also be setup to favor a right- or left-handed shooter as needed. Various external finishes have become available to better suit operating environments (tan for desert, olive drab green for forests , etc...) and some models go further in featuring a folding stock for compactness when traveling.\n\r\nThe TRG family includes the TRG-21 and TRG-41 models which first appeared during 1989 and these were followed by the TRG-22 and TRG-42 of 1999. Because of the various models, overall weights between the products are different and range from 4.7 kilograms in the TRG-22 to 5.8 kilograms in the TRG-42. Similarly, overall lengths become variable as well with the TRG-22 measuring 1,000 mm long and the TRG-42 1,200 mm long. Barrels follow in 20\", 26\", and 27.2\" lengths depending on the model.\n\r\nFew notable variants make up the TRG rifle family and these are largely differentiated by their chosen chamberings which reflect changes to the rifle's internals: the TRG-21 is chambered for the .308 Winchester cartridge and the TRG-22 is marketed as its improved form with an all-new stock. The TRG-41 is chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge and a subvariant of this mark feeds the .300 Winchester Magnum cartridge. The TRG-42 represents the TRG-41's improved variant and is given an all-new stock. The TRG-42 \"Sniper\" is a specialized precision model by Beretta of Italy which began appearing in 2008 and features a shortened barrel assembly, increased rail surface, and folding stock. The TRG M10 \"Sniper Weapon System\" appeared during 2011 with the focus on tactical modularity - indeed its external appearance makes it something of a completely new rifle all its own. Changes to its internals, as well as the magazine and barrel, will allow for firing either .300, .308, and .338 cartridges. This model is primarily reserved for military and police forces.\n\r\nThe TRG series has found considerable use on the global market which has generated a rather lengthy list of operators for a modern sniper rifle - from Albania and Australia to Turkey and Ukraine. As such, some local designations have been created such as the Danish Army's \"Finskyttegevaer M/04\" and the Finnish Army's \"8.6 TKIV 2000\". The Swedish Army knows the rifle as \"Prickskyttegevar 08\" while the Swiss recognizes it as the \"SSGw 04\". Australian special forces have taken on the highly specialized M10 mark.\n\r\nOf the models offered in the TRG-42, the appears to be the most widespread in service. Beyond its military and police service, some forms have proved popular in hunting and sporting civilian markets as well.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "2b7f5b00-98cb-43e9-a3db-43d7717a44c6", "year_model": "1999", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov SV-99", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe SV-99 is a special operations (SPECOPS) minded, highly-portable small-caliber sniping solution promoted by Kalashnikov of Russia.

The weapon is intended for disabling light military vehicles, penetrating fortified enemy positions and counter-sniping duties. Development of this weapon system began at the end of the 1990s under the guidance of ZID, formerly the Degtyarov Plant, makers of World War 2-era anti-material rifles. The Russian Army saw extensive experience in the decade with their two wars against Chechen rebels and the need for a capable and modern anti-material rifle was never more apparent. The KSVK 12.7 was initially known under the designation of ASVK and is based on the earlier SVN-98, an experimental anti-material rifle.\n\r\nThe KSVK 12.7, as its designation suggests, is chambered for the 12.7x108mm cartridge and operates from a manually-actuated bolt-action system that feeds a single round from a spring-loaded, 5-round detachable box magazine. The weapons weighs 12 kilograms sans any optics installations and features a length of 1,400mm with a barrel length of 1,000mm. The rear-fed nature of the magazine (rear of the pistol grip that is) categorizes the KSVK as a \"bullpup\" configured rifle design. Design of the receiver is essentially tubular with a shoulder stock added to the rear for additional support. The shoulder stock features a noticeable ergonomic curve and a bipod is fitted ahead of the receiver as standard. The pistol grip and trigger unit are mounted under the receiver at about the midway point in the design. A long, perforated muzzle brake caps the barrel to help retard the inherent effects of the massive recoil delivered from the firing of the powerful 12.7mm cartridge. The standard rifle design incorporates iron sights for the user but the weapon is designed (by way of an accessories rail) to accept common day/night optics as needed. These optics are fitted just above the pistol grip unit.\n\r\nThe KSVK 12.7 is currently in service with a select group of Russian (and Russian-allied) operators and has seen combat action against Chechen forces - particularly against enemy snipers in the \"counter-sniper\" role.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "97301cc1-45d1-4fa5-b392-e79fab296717", "year_model": "1998", "weapon_name": "AT-14 (Spriggan) / 9M133 (Kornet)", "weapon_type": "Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) System", "description": "\r\n        \tRussian military industry has not rested on its laurels with regards to viable armor-defeating measures - hence the relatively recent introduction of the 9M133 \"Kornet\" (\"Cornet\"), designated by NATO as the AT-14 \"Spriggan\". The weapon is an Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) featuring the missile itself, a tripod support assembly, and integrated optics fit. The missile was showcased in late 1994 and, following the close of extensive testing, was adopted by Russian Army forces before the turn of the century. The Kornet system is said to vastly improve upon the capabilities of those Russian Army anti-tank missile systems currently in service though it is the Kornet's cost-prohibitive nature that has kept it from replacing earlier models outright.\n\r\nThe missile component is a fin-stabilized, solid-fuel rocket propellant development with relying on SACLOS (Semi-Automatic Command to Line-of-Sight) laser beam-riding guidance (the operator must continually point the designator at the target for the duration of the missile's flight envelope). It can support a HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) or thermobaric (fuel-air explosive) warhead and weights 27 kilograms, features a length of 1,200mm and a diameter of 152mm. Effectiveness is against all manner of armor protection to date including Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) and Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) blocks common to many frontline battle tanks. Detonation is by impact fuze and range is out to 10,000 meters depending on missile used with accuracy within a 5 meter radius.\n\r\nIn practice, the Kornet system is typically operated by a crew of two and can be fired from its traditional tripod assembly or from the cover of an armor vehicle when the launcher is fitted to the vehicle itself (as is the case with the BMP-3 series IFV). It has seen considerable combat exposure already, as showcased by Iraqi Army forces against American elements during the coalition invasion of the oil-rich country in 2003. The Kornet was credited with the destruction/disabling of several American Army vehicles including the storied M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank (MBT) during the ensuing action. Additional combat service was by Hezbollah (by way of Syria) against Israeli tanks - the missile once again claiming about a handful of enemy armored vehicles in the process. The Kornet is currently seeing action in the Russian-Ukrainian war over the Donbass region and modern Iraqi Army forces have used the missile against ISIS elements in ongoing fighting across the region (in turn, some of these weapons have fallen into the hands of ISIS fighters).\n\r\nThere are three notable variants in the Kornet missile system series - 9M133-1 is the standard 9M133 missile fitted with a tandem HEAT warhead while the 9M133-1 is the 9M133-1 missile fitted with a thermobaric warhead. The \"Kornet-D\" has been developed to combat the threat posed by slower moving land-based or aerial objects (including helicopters).

Design of the weapon began in the 1990s with production ramping up in 1998. Today, the Kord series has replaced the venerable 1970s-era \"NSV\" series in frontline use (itself a replacement for the World War 2-era ubiquitous DShK series) with Russian military forces and has been featured in a variety of roles throughout its relatively short career to date. The Kord Heavy Machine Gun has seen operational use with both Russian police forces as well as the military. Production of all Kord machine guns is handled out of the V.A. Degtyarev Plant in Russia.\n\r\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Army made extensive use of the NSV series of heavy machine guns across various deployments to counter threats from light armored vehicles, concentrations of dug-in enemy troops and low-flying aircraft - particularly helicopters and strike aircraft. From 1990 on, the vast hardships fell across most of the Soviet Union's political, social and economic fronts, forcing an all-out collapse of the empire and independence for its 15 republics. This worked to cut off some of the resources and production facilities the Soviet military had come to rely on as the Russian military budget was also curtailed and development of key systems was either stalled or canceled outright. Much Soviet production of the NSV series happened to center in the region of modern day Kazakhstan so those facilities were effectively dropped in the transition. Throughout the remainder of the decade, renewed Russian authorities charged the famed Degtyarev concern with design and development of a new modern heavy machine gun solution in the same vein as the NSV before it (including use of the Soviet-era 12.7x108mm cartridge, lightweight construction and a higher rate-of-fire). The result was the similarly-appearing Korg family of heavy automatic weapons that has since gone on to become a new Russian military standard - while the NSV continues service with former Soviet-allied nations today. The Korg HMG entered service with Russian forces in 1998 with production still ongoing.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d4ba6162-31d4-47b2-b62a-098a5f0000b8", "year_model": "1997", "weapon_name": "Accuracy International L115", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the age of the rifle, snipers have played a vital role in battlefield actions, covering mission types ranging from reconnaissance, surveillance and precision assault.

The L115 is one such system that - when coupled with a highly trained marksman of the British military - can deliver devastating results from thousands of yards away. This sort of battlefield flexibility becomes a priceless commodity to the modern day warplanner and ensures that the sniper continues to be a pertinent element as a \"warfighter of tomorrow\".\n\nAdoption of the AWSM as the L115\r\nThe British military adopted the Accuracy International AWSM (Arctic Warfare Super Magnum) and the applicable .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge for use as a standardized sniper rifle and applied the family designation of \"L115\" to the system. The L115 claims a first-round hit against targets out to 600 meters with engagement possible out to 1,100 meters. The optional optics can operate with deadly accuracy in both day and night environments and serve greatly to assist the sniper in ensuring a lethal delivery. Unlike the Accuracy International L96A1 sniper rifle still in use by the British Army (as of this writing), the newer L115 makes use of a heavier 8.59mm caliber cartridge of which five are fitted within the detachable box magazine. The heavier cartridge is said to retard the possibility of the round being \"deflected\" along its trajectory when fired over long ranges. The 5-round magazine is inserted just ahead of the trigger group through the bottom of the receiver and is deliberately designed as a short protrusion helping to abstain from interfering with the delicate sniper process. The optional Schmidt & bender Day Scope has the ability to magnify targets up to 25x and is fitted along an accessories rail atop the receiver. A bipod is fitted for hands-free forend support and adds stability in the firing process. The stock also contains a shoulder pad for improved user comfort. The receiver maintains the integrated pistol grip with associated thumb-hole and the trigger is protected within an oblong trigger ring. The barrel extends a way out from the gun body.\n\nThe L115 Sniper Rifle in Action\r\nThe first L115 models to reach the British military were designated as the L115A1. These were fielded with the Schmidt & Bender 3-12x50 PM II telescopic sights. The L115A1 found itself in the ranks of the British Army, Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines and went on to see extensive combat actions in both Afghanistan and Iraq beginning in 2001 and 2003 respectively.\n\nThe L115A3\r\nBy the end of 2007, the Sniper System Improvement Program (SSIP) was enacted by the British Ministry of Defense. Procurement included an improved form of the base L115 and this became the L115A3. Deliveries of the new system took place beginning in May of 2008 and went on to see combat activities in Afghanistan. The L115A3 made use of a S&B 5-25x56 PM II LP telescopic sight with built-in magnification, illumination, focus, parallax, elevation and windage controls. A suppressor was added to the barrel and helped in reducing both muzzle flash and noise while keeping the sniper concealed - even after having fired his first shot. The shoulder stock could now be folded along the receiver side to help improve the weapon's portability on marches and allowed for placement within a backpack for transport. The L115A3 featured an adjustable cheek piece along the top of the shoulder stock which lent itself well for the sniper charged with observing his target for hours on end. Unlike the L115A1, the bipod of the L115A3 was made adjustable and set to preference by the operator himself. Additionally, the L115A3 sported a monopod (\"buttspike\") along the underside of the stock for improved stability. Other portions of the SSIP as it related to the L115A3 include use of a heavy-duty tripod, spotting scopes and laser range finders - truly making the L115 a complete sniper package.\n\nThe L115 as a Record-Setter\r\nIt is noted that a British Army sniper, utilizing an L115, recorded the longest sniper kill in history during November of 2009 when he successfully engaged and defeated a pair of Taliban machine gunners at a range of 2,707 yards. The rifle used was of the L115A3 model variety.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "25fa0bad-919e-437c-b844-6e0214b252c6", "year_model": "1997", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov AK-107 (Alexandrov / Kalashnikov)", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kalashnikov AK-107 is another in the long line of available - and modernized - versions of the hugely successful AK-47 assault rifle of the late 1940s. Over time, the type has evolved in a myriad of ways that have worked to make the Kalashnikov brand a household name for half or a century. The AK-107 is one such version and makes use of lightweight resilient fiberglass-reinforced polymers  in its construction that make for a lighter assault system as well as a cheaper product to mass-produce - qualities lacking in the wood-furniture and metal construction of the ubiquitous AK series prior (beginning with the AK-47 itself). Principally, the AK-107 is noted for its use of the \"Balanced Automatic Recoil System\" (BARS) that, as the name suggests, \"balances\" the gas operation of the firing operation and makes for a more stable gunnery platform (recoil is substantially reduced for improved accuracy). The BARS system was trialled in the developmental AL-7 series rifles. Design of the AK-107 began in the 1990s and was led by Izhmash engineer Youriy Alexandrov. Production was subsequently handled by Izhmash of Izhevsk, Russia. As of this writing, the AK-107 model assault rifle is solely in service with Russian forces.\n\r\nThe AK-107 features an empty weight of 8.38lbs with a running length of 37.1 inches and a barrel measuring in at 16.3 inches. As the weapon features a folding hinged solid shoulder stock, it can be compacted to a more manageable length of 27.6 inches. The base cartridge is the Soviet standard 5.45x39mm cartridge that debuted in 1974 for the new AK-74 series assault rifle. Feeding is via a 30-round spring-loaded curved detachable box magazine as well as the 60-round \"casket\" magazines available to the AK-74 series. The AK-107 is a gas-operated system with a rotating bolt action and offers semi- and full-automatic fire modes as well as a three-round burst selection rate. Rate-of-fire is listed at 850 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 2,953 feet per second while effective range is out to approximately 500 meters. The AK-107 is sighted by way of a rear \"Vee\" notch and tangent with a front post fixture. Like all other Kalashnikov assault rifles, the AK-107 sports its gas cylinder over the barrel assembly, a slab-sided receiver with the cocking mechanism fitted to the right side of the body. The AK-107 is designed as something of a \"modular\" weapons  system in that can mount a variety of available optics, aiming accessories and the 40mm GP-25 series single-shot, underslung grenade launcher.\n\r\nThe \"AK-108\" is simply a derivative of the AK-107 series assault rifle, though chambered for the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge instead of the 5.45x39mm Soviet cartridge. This served to market the assault rifle family line to a wider NATO-minded audience.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "dd881643-e6d8-488c-9882-6f1d57578764", "year_model": "1996", "weapon_name": "Accuracy International AWM (Arctic Warfare Magnum)", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe British concern of Accuracy International added the AWM (\"Arctic Warfare Magnum\") bolt-action sniper rifle to its lineup in 1996 and the series went on to find considerable military value in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars that followed. As a manually-actuated bolt-action system, the AWM is a true sniper rifle in every sense of the word and able to engage targets (effectively) out to 1,640 yards. The weapon is marketed in two primary chamberings: .300 Winchester Magnum and the more popular .338 Lapua Magnum.\n\r\nThe .338 Lapua Magnum is a high-performance, high-energy cartridge capable of anti-personnel function and (limited) anti-material function. This gives the cartridge a multi-role use over the battlefield in that the sniper can engage both enemy personnel and light-armored vehicles at range with success. The AWM is fielded with a scope over the receiver for accurized ranged fire and feeds from a five-round detachable box magazine fitted ahead of the trigger group.  At its core, the AWM is based on the earlier \"Arctic Warfare\" (AW) line of rifles put out by Accuracy International and thus follows its tried and proven design qualities. However, to contend with the more powerful and longer cartridge, some internal changes to the firing and feed mechanisms were made.\n\r\nAs in most military sniper rifles, the AWM sports some adjustability to better serve the firer - the stock has an adjustable cheekpiece and shoulder pad while a monopod support can be fitted under the stock and adjusted form height. A folding bipod installed under the forend serves a similar support function. There is also a section of rail over the receiver for the mounting of various optics which, themselves, are inherently adjustable.\n\r\nOperators of the AWM globally are plenty and currently range from Armenia and Bangladesh to Russia and the United States. These see service with both special police units and special forces groups and are mainly chambered in .388 Lapua Magnum.\n\r\nThe AWM also makes up the \"L115A1\" Sniper Rifle in the British military inventory. These are fielded with Schmidt & bender 3-12x50 scopes, flash and noise suppressors, folding (adjustable) stocks for increased transportability, monopod supports, and five-round box magazines. The longest confirmed sniper kill in recorded history belongs to British Army sniper CoH Craig Harrison who managed two successive kills of Taliban infantry from 2,707 yards away using his L115A1 rifle.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "7197a9fd-01bc-4343-b9c9-929034451f70", "year_model": "1996", "weapon_name": "KBP OSV-96", "weapon_type": "Anti-Material Rifle (AMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian OSV-96 is a standard, no-frills large-caliber anti-tank/anti-material precision rifle system of conventional design. It sports a large detachable box magazine that is inserted into the bottom of the receiver, a pistol grip, padded skeletal shoulder stock, forward carrying handle, integrated folding bipod under the barrel and optional optics. The long-running free-floating barrel is capped by a large slotted muzzle brake to help dampen recoil effects. The firing action revolves around a gas-operation with rotating bolt mechanism and semi-automatic rate-of-fire - allowing the operator to fire off successive shots without manually managing a bolt. The box magazine holds 5 x 12.7x108mm cartridges (equivalent to the 12.7x99mm NATO) while optics are backed by traditional iron sights to maintain ranged capabilities should a scope fail. Overall length of the weapon is 1,746 millimeters with a 1,000 millimeter long barrel assembly and effective range is out to 2,000 meters. The weapon was designed in the 1990s and introduced in 1996, currently seeing service with Russian intelligence and special forces elements and Indian special marine units.\n\r\nThe anti-tank/anti-material rifle is an ever growing heavy weapons category of the modern battlefield. These weapon types can be utilized to attack all manner of lightly-armored or fortified high-value targets or emplacements. Optics allow for precision shooting at distance to the point that the operator can engage key systems on a vehicle (a combat tank for instance) or structure to render them useless. To put the value of large-caliber guns into perspective, these weapon types hold the capability to cut clean through engine blocks at range.\n\r\nAs is the case with most anti-material rifles, the OSV-96 is a dimensionally large and weighty weapon system requiring operation by specially-trained personnel. The weapon is designed to fold at the barrel/receiver for improved portability though its size and weight are still a concern. The weapon holds and inherently violent recoil which is consistent in the firing of such large cartridges so firing is generally from the prone position with the rifle balanced on its bipod assembly and the buttstock tucked into the operator's shoulder. The OSV-96 (as with all large-caliber rifles of this breed) gives off a very audible and visual blast effect which, in some cases, may expose the firer's position to the enemy. However, this is countered to an extent by the sheer penetrating capabilities of such a large-caliber firearm.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ad41af45-abce-4024-b7a4-55a656bfe5e2", "year_model": "1996", "weapon_name": "PP-19 Bizon (Bison)", "weapon_type": "Submachine Gun (SMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs called for a new lightweight, close-in fighting weapon system suitable for special forces and internal security use. The weapon would be able to supply repeating volume fire with excellent accuracy within range and offer capable man-stopping qualities in a compact package falling into the submachine gun classification.  Various forms were entertained and experimented with until the \"PP-19 Bizon\" prototype emerged as the favorite. Design work on the Bizon was headed by Viktor Kalashnikov, son of fabled gunsmith Mikhail Kalashnikov, and spanned from 1993 to 1995. The senior Kalashnikov was already well-known around the world for having designed the ubiquitous AK-47 series of gas-operated assault rifles and its numerous variants. As such, the Bizon itself was born out of the true Kalashnikov pedigree and brought with it much of what made the former designs so reliable and popular amongst its myriad of users. Production of the new weapon began shortly thereafter and was handled by the long-running Izhmash concern. The PP-19 has been in operational service since 1996 and is issued to both Russian special forces elements (including Spetsnaz) and several internal governmental security forces.\n\r\nThe Bizon's firing action is based on the \"straight blowback principle\" utilizing a closed-bolt assembly. There is a fire selector switch which allows for different methods of fire based on operator needs of the moment (safety, semi-automatic fire and full-automatic fire). The outward appearance of the receiver (taken from the AKS-74) is in the standard Kalashnikov styling with the charging handle and ejection port seated to the right side of the body. The black fiberglass-polyamide pistol grip (taken from the newer AK-100 series) is slightly angled rearwards and lacks ergonomic finger grooves. The curved trigger (taken from the AK-74 assault rifle) is set within the large rectangular trigger guard and suits a gloved hand easily enough. A Kalashnikov-style magazine release is identified ahead of the trigger unit and aft of the magazine feed. The barrel assembly is covered over by a metal forestock which sports three horizontal cooling slots to either side. The two-strut shoulder stock (taken from the AKS-74 ) is hinged to fold over the left side of the gun body, not impeding the gun's functionality whatsoever. The folding stock allows for a more compact form, suitable to the close-in fighting required of special forces and security forces alike. The barrel protrudes a short distance ahead of the forend and is capped by a slotted muzzle brake. The Bizon retains the AK-style rear sight (ala the AKS-74U series) at the front end of the upper receiver and also fits a forward sight aft of the muzzle brake.\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting feature of the Bizon is its cylindrical \"helical\" magazine which sits under the lower receiver and forestock. This drum-style magazine approach allows for greater ammunition-carrying capacities in a compact form but also requires the need of a rather complicated internal feed mechanism to manage each cartridge at speed as they are accepted into the receiver. This undoubtedly increases the chance of an internal jam during basic firing functions. The base Bizon fires from a 64-round drum. The weapon was initially chambered for the 9x18mm Makarov cartridge but has since been branched out to include the 9x19mm Parabellum , the .380 ACP and the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridges.\n\r\nThe PP-19 Bizon sports a rate-of-fire between 650 and 700 rounds per minute. She weighs in at approximately 4.6lbs and features a muzzle velocity over 1,000 feet per second (varies depending on ammunition type being used). Effective range is out to 200 meters, again, depending on cartridge selected. Overall length is 26 inches with the stock extended. This shrinks to a very compact 16 inches when folded over.\n\r\nThe original Bizon production model was the plainly labeled \"Bizon\" which was changed to \"Bizon-1\" after the arrival of the \"Bizon-2\". The Bizon-2 was actually a revised family of firearm subsets to include the Bizon-2-01 through the Bizon-2-07, each differing in their chambering, ammunition count and functionality. The Bizon-2-01 was chambered for the 9x19 Parabellum cartridge and utilized a 53-round magazine. The Bizon-2-02 was chambered for the .380 ACP and sported a 64-round magazine. The Bizon-2-03 was chambered for the 9x18 Makarov cartridge and issued with an integral sound suppressor for clandestine work. The Bizon-2-04 was similar in that it chambered the 9x18 Makarov cartridge but was a basic shortened \"carbine\" form with semi-automatic firing functionality. The Bizon-2-05 was offered in the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge and was a semi-automatic-fire-only variant. The Bizon-2-06 was chambered for the .380 ACP and offered semi-automatic-fire-only. The Bizon-2-07 was chambered for the 7.62x25mm Tokarev and, interestingly, was completed with a 35-round detachable box magazine over the original's helical drum. The Bizon-3 followed the Bizon-2 into production and incorporated subtle changes to the overall design including a relocated rear sight, an over-folding stock and muzzle adapter.\n\r\nThe Bizon has since seen combat action in the 2nd Chechen War and, more recently, during the 2008 war with Georgia over South Ossetia. The \"Bizon\" names simply translates to \"Bison\".\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "41195bd2-34de-40ba-a427-57288b40ae96", "year_model": "1995", "weapon_name": "Izhmash Saiga-12", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Combat Shotgun", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian firm Izhmash produces the impressive Saiga-12, a semi-automatic fire-capable combat shotgun that has earned a high level of respect for both its lethality and its reliability since its introduction in the 1990's. It is produced in a handful of variants and can fire a variety of ammunition types, calibers and magazines and can be operated in any climate. As the Izhmash firm had already maintained experience in production of Kalashnikov-pattern guns it is no surprise to see the commonality of design and parts between the Kalashnikov designs and the Saiga-12.\n\r\nThe base Saiga-12 sports an exterior look not unlike the Kalashnikov AK-47. In fact, the body appears essentially the same and features the identifiable lever-safety along the right side and the firing action is directly descended from the legendary AK-47. The pistol grip is fitted behind the trigger guard and angular detachable box magazine. Like AK-47's, the Saiga-12 also makes use of a low-fitting barrel with the gas tube mounted above. A wrap-around hand guard protects the user from touching the hot gas tube. The shotgun system also comes off of the same assembly lines that produce the Kalashnikov AK-74M and AK-100 rifle series and are denoted with the red Izhmash triangle logo featuring an upwards-facing arrow. The Saiga-12 can be manufactured with a traditional solid buttstock (Saiga-12), extending tubular buttstock or a skeletal collapsible stock (Saiga-12S, Saiga-12K, Saiga-12S EXP-01) for increased portability while still others  sport a traditional hunting rifle-style buttstock with integrated pistol grip. The system - for obvious reasons - also sports a much larger ammunition extraction hole for spent shell casings, this along the right side of the body. The overall finish is a matte black powder with a slight texture feel.\n\r\nThe Saiga-12 is characterized as a self-loading smooth bore 12-guage shotgun. The Saiga-12 can fire from a 2-, 5-, 8-, 10-, or 12-round detachable box magazines. Additionally, this can be replaced by a 20-round ammunition drum. The Saiga-12 is available in .30-06, 7.62x39mm, .308 Winchester, 9x53R, 5.6x39mm and .223 Remington calibers as well as 20- and .410 shot gauges. The firing operation is gas-operated, featuring a rotating bolt. The gas system is adjustable depending on the type of ammunition being utilized. Barrel options include lengths up to 24 inches and threaded/non-threaded types. One drawback of the firing system has been the lack of a hold-open bolt device after the last round is fired, resulting in a more complicated reloading process.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4644f3d0-7803-45d6-9d98-164c0cc25a88", "year_model": "1995", "weapon_name": "Izhmash Saiga-410", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Shotgun", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile automatic firing shotguns are slowly entering the firearms forefront, there is something to be said for the power inherent in the self-loading shotgun. The Saiga-410 from Izhmash of Russia is one such implement that supplies the firer with a steady repeating-fire quality seen in battle rifles the world over and this from the tried and true Kalashnikov lineage. As such, the 410 series retains some visible similarities to the famous Soviet-era assault rifle design, particularly at the receiver, and comes from a proven pedigree that most other weapons would envy. Essentially, the Saiga-410 series melds the Kalashnikov firing action with the .410 cartridge - hence the designation of \"410\". The Saiga-410 can fire both buckshot and slug type ammunition from a 2-, 4- or 10-round ammunition supply through a detachable box magazine. The .410ga barrel is smoothbore in its design and is designed to accept various chokes at the muzzle as required for different spread effects. Overall, the weapon is intended for small-to medium-sized game hunting as well as defense and security while proving a highly robust and reliable firearm since its inception in 1995.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Saiga-410 certainly takes on a distinct appearance when compared to traditional shotgun designs. The AK-receiver appearance is more or less retained with its right-side ejection port, charging handle and large fire selector lever. The prominent magazine release-catch found on the AK series is also identifiable in the Saiga-410 design, this just aft of the magazine well. The trigger sits within a near-rectangular ring while magazines are of a straight design. Depending on the production model, the stock can be wooden or polymer in its construction and fixed, solid or hollowed-framed (additionally folding in some versions). The forestock can also be finished in wood or polymer depending on the model in question. The gas-cylinder is mounted atop the barrel under the handguard shrouding to which the barrel extends a distance ahead - this arrangement being very typical of Kalashnikov-inspired firearms. Some 410 models also retain the AK-style forend, to which the end of the gas cylinder is clearly visible in its connection to the barrel and even an AK-style front post sight is clearly identifiable. While iron sights are standard, specialized optics can be affixed to the rear portion of the receiver top via an accessories rail system for more accurized fire. In all, the Saiga-410 exhibits very clean lines while not hiding its devastating intentions.\n\r\nThe 410 is marketed in five distinct forms beginning with the base Saiga-410 and its fixed solid buttstock with 570mm barrel length (483mm and 612mm available through special order). The Saiga-410S features a folding butt and a ergonomic polymer pistol grip as well as a 570mm barrel length. The Saiga-410K has a folding polymer buttstock as well as a polymer forend with a shorter 330mm barrel length. The Saiga-410K \"Version 01\" maintains a folding buttstock and sports a 404mm barrel length with a 3.1kg unloaded weight. The follow-up Saiga-410K \"Version 02\" has a hollowed out folding frame buttstock (polymer or metal construction), the same 404mm length barrel, a 3.4 unloaded weight and plastic forestock. The Version 01 and Version 02 variants both feature a \"universal iron sight\" that allows for ranging out to 25mm and 50mm depending on ammunition type being used (buckshot and slug respectively). The front sight is adjustable. K-models also sport a unique feature where the buttstock is folded, locking the trigger to prevent it from firing.\n\r\nStandard range for the basic slug ammunition is approximately 100 meters.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3578d0a0-bef7-4db5-a8c8-be1551dc3cba", "year_model": "1995", "weapon_name": "KBP AGS-30 AGL", "weapon_type": "30mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AGS-30 is the modern Russian military 30mm automatic grenade launcher for fire support, superseding the Cold War-era AGS-17 \"Plamya\" (\"Flame\"). While the AGS-17 was an effective grenade projector for its time, it was a product of the period with origins in the 1970s and designed with the open-field warfare influenced by World War 2. However, by the 1990s, warfare had evolved to the contained urban conflicts seen today and the Soviet Union as a political and military power was no more. This gave rise to development of a new, indigenous modernized Russian automatic grenade projector which became the \"AGS-30\". Beyond its adoption by the Russian Army, the type has seen issuance in the militaries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh and India. India produces the weapon under license at its Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli facility.\n\r\nThe AGS-30 continues use of the Soviet-era 30x29mm grenade as well as reliance on a blowback system of operation but features a lighter (16kg unloaded), more compact design. It compares favorably to the larger-caliber (40mm) American Mk 19 series. The weapon is sighted through the standard PAG-17 adjustable sighting device. Feeding is through a 29-grenade belt housed in a hardened cassette drum fitted to the right side of the receiver. The weapon can reach out to effective ranges of 2,300 meters through a 400 round-per-minute, rate-of-fire. Spent casings are ejected through a large port along the left of the receiver. The barrel is rifled for accuracy while actuation of the weapon is through spade grips fitted on the weapon's mounting. The weapon can be fired from its standard-issue tripod mounting or affixed to a vehicle as needed. The operator can engage targets through direct or in-direct fire as the situation calls. Its lightweight design also makes relocation of the weapon by a single crew possible.\n\r\nDesign of the AGS-30 is attributed to the KBP Instrument Design Bureau which also handles its production. Over 500 of the weapon type have been produced to date (2013). The AGS-30 officially entered service in 1995 and has already seen field action with Russian forces through the Second Chechen War (1999-2000) and the South Ossetia War (2008).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f01f2cfd-d90d-41c4-b6a1-fa6aaa17b488", "year_model": "1995", "weapon_name": "KMP AEK-919", "weapon_type": "Submachine Gun (SMG) / Machine Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian KMP AEK-919 is a highly compact submachine gun in the mold of the classic Israeli UZI with its pistol grip magazine and balanced hold.

Chambered for the Russian 9x18mm Makarov pistol cartridge, the AEK-919 is a stable firing platform with good qualities. Its design was headed by the Kovrov Mechanical Plant (KMP) and the weapon has seen combat service in the First Chechnya War (1994-1996) - its introduction was in 1995. It is in use by Russian special forces, regular army (vehicle/aircraft crews) and special police units requiring the services of a compact, high-volume weapon. The threaded barrel also allows use of a silencer for clandestine operations.\n\r\nInternally, the AEK-919 utilizes a proven blowback system of operation along with an open bolt arrangement. It has a polygonal barrel and three-position selector switch (the latter near the pistol grip for three-round burst or singe-shot fire). The charging handle is set to the left side of the receiver towards the muzzle. As in the Israeli UZI or a semi-automatic pistol, the magazine (available in 20- or 30-round count) is inserted into the pistol grip which helps the design retain a contained profile. The shoulder stock at the rear of the receiver is collapsible which aids in shooting support when extended and, again, helps the weapon keep its smallish silhouette. The barrel is just 6.5 inches long. All of these qualities make the AEK-919 a valuable close-quarters weapon design. Optics over the receiver are supported for more accurized fire in the field when needed. Sling loops allow for a shoulder strap to be used.\n\r\nThe AEK-919 was used in active operational trials prior to its wide scale adoption and some 100 weapons were in circulation. The AEK-918 is a version chambered for the 9x19mm (7N21/7N31) cartridge while the AEK-918V makes use of the German 9x19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge through a 30-round magazine.

Despite her 1960s vintage, the AKM - in her vintage form - has remained a stalwart accomplice to plenty of high-level action across the globe. The AK-103 simply takes the excellent qualities of the AKM system and brings them into the modern age with plastic composites and polymers replacing the old (and heavy) wood furniture of earlier Kalashnikov rifle attempts. The AK-103 also distinguishes itself from her former form by introducing support for accessories, optics and modern grenade launchers. Design of the AK-103 occurred in 1994 and production has since been handled by the Izhevsk Mechanical Works to which some 160,000 examples have been delivered. Operators of the AK-103 include Ethiopia, India, Venezuela, and certain specialized Russian police forces.\n\r\nExternally, the AK-103 displays much of the same lines of the AK-47 form the 1950s.

Additionally, aiming lasers and flashlights as well as the GP-30 single-shot grenade launcher can be affixed around the forend and under the barrel.\n\r\nThe weapon weighs in at 7.5lbs sans the magazine installed. Overall length is 37.1 inches with the stock fully extended and 27.6 inches with the stock collapsed along the side of the receiver. The barrel is 16.3 inches in length. Like the AKM, the AK-103 (and AK-104 for that matter) are chambered for the 7.62x39mm standard Russian cartridge dating back to the Soviet era. The firing action is gas operated with a rotating bolt from a 30-round, curved detachable magazine. Rate of fire is around 650 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 2,411 feet per second. Range is out to 500 meters.\n\r\nThe AK-103 was naturally evolved into a more compact carbine form under the designation of AK-104, in much the same way the full-length AK-101 is to the shorter AK-102 series.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f6795dfd-56d5-4c71-ba80-6db3e0fec0d4", "year_model": "1994", "weapon_name": "KBP VSK-94", "weapon_type": "Silenced Military / Special Police Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile the VSS \"Vintorez\" silenced sniper rifle of 1987 proved excellent in its given role, it was an expensive end-product for Russian special forces and internal security elements. In the 1990s, The KBP Instrument Design Bureau headed a program to produce a budget-friendly alternative which begat the \"VSK-94\" silenced sniper rifle.  The VSK-94 was a further evolution of the 9A-91 carbine automatic weapon introduced in 1993 (also by KBP) and incorporated its proven elements for the 1994 VSK-94 development. As in the VSS, the VSK-94 utilized the same subsonic Soviet-Russian 9x39mm cartridge (essentially the full-sized 7.62x39mm rifle cartridge body with a revised neck to seat a 9mm bullet) coupled with a silencer assembly fitted over the muzzle. This combination allows for a reduction in the telltale sounds of the exiting bullet while retaining a useful engagement range and repeat-fire qualities of an automatic weapon.\n\r\nThe original 9A-91 carbine assault weapon can still be recognized in the VSK-94 design. Key physical changes include the integrated double-strut, lightweight polymer stock and the cylindrical silencer assembly. The VSK-94 features the same receiver lines of the 9A-91 series as well as its straight detachable box magazine. The pistol grip adds ergonomic comfort and the oblong trigger ring allows use of a gloved hand. Magazines are inserted into the well ahead of the trigger group in the usual way. The charging handle is set to the right side of the body as is the ejection port. Thusly, optics are attached to the left side of the receiver - the standard fitting being the 4x PSO-1 series scope (backed by the 9A-91's iron sights). The PSO-1 series is a common sight for the famous Dragunov SVD sniper rifle family. Receiver construction is of all steel for rugged usability in-the-field. As with the 9A-91, the VSK-94 is fed from a 20-round detachable spring-loaded straight box magazine tied to the gas-operated, rotating bolt action. This allows a rate-of-fire of approximately 700 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 270 meters per second out to an effective range of 400 meters.\n\r\nThe VSK-94 silenced sniper rifle remains in limited use by special Russian military and internal security forces and is called upon during clandestine operations. With that in mind, the VSK-94 has assuredly seen its fair share of combat service concerning the Russian special forces group SPETSNAZ.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "260dd83d-cb26-4d7b-ab1d-51b5a0d5a08d", "year_model": "1994", "weapon_name": "OTs-03 SVU", "weapon_type": "Designated Marksman Rifle / Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tWith a growing worldwide move towards the \"bullpup\" configured assault weapon, the Russian military has since taken delivery of the Dragunov OTs-03 SVU (\"Short Sniper Rifle\") series sniper rifle beginning in 1994. For decades, Soviet military forces (and its many global customers) relied on the tried-and-true Dragunov SVD series for its long-range sniping requirements, believing in its semi-automatic action over traditional bolt-action types. The weapon was adopted in 1963 and noted for its accuracy while firing the proven Soviet 7.62x54mmR rifle cartridge through a 10-round detachable box magazine (unlike Western counterparts using a bolt-action usually with a 5-round magazine capacity). In this way, the Soviet SVD was more akin to the modern-day category of \"Designated Marksman Rifle\" (DMR) - though it could effectively assume the role of dedicated sniping nonetheless. An exceptional system for its time, a modernization was inevitably required for Russian elements as it continued to resurgence from the Cold War years.\n\r\nThe OTs-03 entered production through the Central Design Research Bureau of Sporting and Hunting Arms. It sports an unloaded, un-accessorized weight of 3.6 kilograms with a 34.2 inch overall length and barrel assembly measuring 20.4 inches. As with the SVD before it, the SVU is chambered for the 7.62x54mmR rifle cartridge, a proven man-stopper, and fed from a 10- or 20-round detachable box magazine. The action is of a gas-operated arrangement coupled with a three-lug rotating bolt system similar to the one found on the SVD. Indeed, the SVU can be considered a modernized, bullpup form of the storied SVD. Muzzle velocity is listed at 2,700 feet per second.\n\r\nThe bullpup configuration receives its name by the relocating of the action and magazine feed aft of the trigger unit. In this way, the weight of the weapon is now concentrated at the shoulder and a full-length barrel can be retained while a more compact overall design form is achieved. However, such an arrangement generally limits positioning of the ejection port at the right side of the weapon, favoring right-handed shooters over left-handed ones. Additionally, the shorter protrusion of the barrel can see the support hand accidentally pass in front of the barrel when firing - though this is more a fear associated with bullpup assault/automatic rifles in-the-field. Bullpup weapons, due to their enlarged receivers which integrate the shoulder stock, cannot feature a folding stock which is used to increase portability.\n\r\nTo the keen observer, the SVU retains some of the physical qualities of the preceding SVD design. The gas cylinder is identified over the barrel while the pistol grip is set at the midway point of the design aft of the ringed trigger system. A polymer housing (with horizontal venting slots) is set over the grip handle. The receiver/shoulder stock is seen with the usual oversized fire selector switch. A large ejection port is featured just aft of the pistol grip along the right side of the weapon. There is a butt pad for some comfort against the shoulder while an internal spring in the stock also works to dampen some of the recoil effect. A bipod can be affixed to the underside of the weapon for frontal support, freeing the support hand to manage the (optional) sight fitted over the polymer housing ahead of the receiver. The barrel is capped by a specially-designed muzzle brake which is intended to reduce recoil by as much as 40%. This can be replaced by a sound suppressor for more clandestine operation (though not entirely a \"silent\" weapon in practice). Folding iron sights (featuring a rear folding U-notch and front ring post) are retained as back-up to the standard installation of a PSO-1 series telescopic sight (complete with tritium illumination).\n\r\nOriginal production forms of the SVU were designated simply as \"OTs-13\" and these featured semi-automatic fire only. The OTs-13A SVU-A was then introduced with a full-automatic action which allows it to function more as a traditional Designated Marksman Rifle/Battle Rifle if the situation requires it. To date, the SVU family has seen issuance to Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs personnel and purchase by the Yemeni Army. Russian forces combat-tested their newly-minted SVU systems during the First Chechen War (1994-1996).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "6cbc9886-9089-4e48-b0df-41fa2f2b5e3d", "year_model": "1994", "weapon_name": "OTs-14 (Groza)", "weapon_type": "Bullpup Assault Rifle / Assault Carbine", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile several world powers have embraced the \"bullpup\" configured assault weapon, it is mainly the United States and Russia who present two major holdovers preferring a traditional rifle arrangement. A bullpup weapon is one that sets the action and feed aft of the trigger unit, allowing most of the weapon's bulk to be concentrated at the shoulder and a full-length barrel to be utilized. While presenting obvious benefits in bringing the gun up to fire quickly and allowing for a more compact form to be achieved, it displays some disadvantages such as awkward reloading, a shortened forend  and rear-set center of gravity. The British L85, Belgian P90, French FAMAS and Austrian Steyr AUG come to mind and several other weapon designs have followed suit at an increasing rate. \n\r\nIntroduced in 1994, the OTs-14 \"Groza\" is a Russian-originated, bullpup-configured assault rifle built upon the successful pedigree that is the AKS-74U assault carbine - an automatic weapon utilizing the classic Kalashnikov action and mimicking the famous AK-47 in its general form - albeit more compact. The Groza represents a major departure from the tried-and-true Kalashnikov \"look\" and brings about a handier weapon system which has already been trialed across the First (1994-1996) and Second (1999-2000) Chechen Wars as well as actions making up the South Ossetia War (2008) against Georgia. Design of the OTs-14 is attributed to V.N. Telesh and U.V. Lebedev while manufacture of the weapon is provided through the TsKIB SOO bureau.\n\r\nThe OTs-14 carries a unique appearance when compared to previous Soviet-era and modern Russian gun offerings. As expected, the action and feed are set at the rear as part of the shoulder stock. This promotes use of a full-length barrel within a shorter receiver and, thusly, a shortened length can be achieved. There is a carrying handle set about the top of the receiver in the usual way and magazines are curved by design and inserted aft of the pistol grip. The pistol grip is angled ergonomically rearwards and sits under the aft part of the receiver, attached near the trigger which itself is protected by a rectangular ring guard. The barrel protrudes a short distance away from the receiver and can feature an optional vertical forward grip (foregrip). The weapon is cocked and spent casings ejected along the right side of the body. Sights include a standard iron arrangement as well as support for a PO4x34 series scope. The forward portion of the weapon accepts an optional, Russian military standard GP-30 grenade launcher to help increase the tactical value of the rifle. The Groza weighs approximately 3 kilograms and sports a running length of 610mm, its barrel measuring 415mm long. The weapon does not support ambidextrous firing for the ejection port is fixed permanently to the right side of the frame. The result is a useful, short-to-medium range assault system suitable for close-confine fighting in the urban environment.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "7e063792-4d7b-4016-b8a0-1ed463a0c376", "year_model": "1994", "weapon_name": "RG-6 (6G39)", "weapon_type": "40mm Six-Shot Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tWith the growing need to fight more urban environment battles, the Russian military adopted the capable, 40mm multi-shot \"RG-6\" grenade launcher (GRAU designation of \"6G30\") in 1994. The weapon has since seen issue to Ministry of Internal Affairs elements as well with combat action centering on both Chechen Wars and current, on-going military operations in the south of Russia. Design of the weapon is attributed to TsKIB SOO and production is ongoing as of this writing (February 2014).\n\r\nAt its core, the RG-6 is a semi-automatic weapon chambered for the special caseless 40mm VOG-25 series grenade - the same as featured in the standard-issue GL-25 underslung assault rifle launcher (detailed elsewhere on this site). The RG-6 sports a Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger set with enlarged loop to support a gloved hand and can sustain a rate-of-fire up to 18 rounds per minute. Grenades are housed in a six-shot rotating cylinder which swings out for reloading. Unlike Western repeat-fire grenade launchers (which load through the breech end) , the RG-6 is loaded through the muzzle end of the cylinder chambers. A spring used to rotate the cylinder is then manually wound prior to firing. Another unique facet of the cylinder's design is that each chamber is rifled and the barrel left as smoothbore. Thusly, the chambers themselves impart the necessary rotation upon the exiting projectile (as opposed to the barrel). \r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "aa30b568-a4ba-4209-8698-02c5ea6aed28", "year_model": "1993", "weapon_name": "Izhevsk MR-412 REX (Revolver for EXport)", "weapon_type": "Six-Shot Revolver", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MR-412 REX (\"Revolver for EXport\") (also \"MP-412 PEKC\") was a short-lived six-shot revolver emerging from Russia in the early 1990s by way of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant. The sidearm was developed with the export market in mind and not any one standing Russian military / police requirement. At its core, it became a conventional revolver with the usual traits afforded such weapons and a relatively new addition to the world of pistols. However, the MR-412 REX never entered serial production due to restrictive gun import laws in the United States - the largest potential civilian market for export firearms.\n\r\nThe design saw a large polymer grip used that featured an integrated trigger loop ring encompassing the small, curved trigger. The hammer was only slightly exposed at the rear of the frame. Iron sights were positioned at their usual places over the frame (forward and aft). The barrel was encased in a slab-sided assembly at the front of the gun and the lower section of the frame was completed of polymers while the rest of the weapon remained high grade steel.\n\r\nOne of the unique features of this gun was its \"break-open\" frame (reminiscent of 19th Century pistols) in which the forward end of the gun could be pulled down by the operator, along a centralized hinge, to expose the cylinder for reloading. This was a deviation from the norm where modern revolvers typically featured \"swing-out\" cylinders for the same action. The gun was available in both .357 Magnum and .38 Special chamberings and operated from a Single-Action / Double-Action (SA/DA) trigger system. A 4\" and 6\" barrel were also offered.

The system began its design phase in the early 1990s under the direction of V.N. Telesh and U.V. Lebedev and made use of the unique 9x39mm cartridge, a subsonic cartridge born in Soviet Russia during the 1980s under the direction of Nikolai Zabelin. The cartridge was based on the famous 7.62x39mm rifle-type featuring its rimless, bottleneck design though capped by a 9mm bullet - therefore providing the increased penetration, range and firepower of the 7.62mm cartridge with the low power qualities of the 9mm pistol cartridge. It was primarily intended for use by special Soviet elements and focused on suppressed firearms for a truly silent weapon. Range of the cartridge was, however, limited to less than 400 meters. \n\r\nProduction of the OTs-12 was handled by TsKIB SOO (\"Central Design Bureau of Sporting and Hunting Weapons\") beginning in 1993 though it is said that only several hundred examples were produced for operational trials and ultimately dropped from contention in relatively short order. Primary users were Soviet paramilitary \"Internal Troops\" who found favor with the new weapon but there proved little government need at the time. Additionally, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to many Russian military programs being underfunded or dropped entirely.\n\r\nAt its core, the OTs-12 was essentially a conventional assault system aside from its specialized cartridge. It utilized a gas system of operation with the cylinder set above the barrel in the usual Kalashnikov fashion. The barrel itself was short for a more compact footprint and the body of the rifle was truly Kalashnikov in its design styling featuring the requisite large fire selector switch, charging handle and ejection port all seated along the right side of the frame. The weapon was given a conventional pistol grip with integrated trigger unit, a forward-set magazine feed (using curved magazine boxes) and the usual magazine release/catch situated between the grip and magazine feed areas. The shoulder stock was skeletal using a conjoined, two-strut shape and hinged to fold over the side of the receiver for a more compact product during transport or use in confined spaces. The folded stock in no way limited the action of the weapon. Wood furniture was only present at the forend as a two-piece section and serves as a heat shield/forward hand grip against the hot barrel. Iron sights provided basic sighting for ranged work while optics were optional. Overall weight was listed at 2.5 kilograms with a complete running length of 730mm, the barrel measuring 207mm long.\n\r\nPerformance of the OTs-12 proved comparable to other modern assault systems of the period including an 800 round-per-minute rate-of-fire. The weapon was fed through a 20-round curved detachable box magazine in the usual way and a 25-round count may have been developed. Effective range was listed at approximately 200 meters while maximum range, limited largely by the cartridge in use, was under 400 meters.\n\r\nThe \"Tiss\" name is derived from \"Yew Tree\" common to parts of Europe, Africa and Asia.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ab9ed106-eb6a-4e56-967d-e694ecb23e17", "year_model": "1992", "weapon_name": "AT-13 (Saxhorn-2) / 9K115-2 (Metis-M)", "weapon_type": "Wire-Guided Anti-Tank Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AT-13 \"Saxhorn-2\" is a man-portable anti-tank missile system of Russian origin and is a modernized form of the original AT-7 \"Saxhorn\". The major difference between the two systems is the AT-13s newer missile which sports larger dimensions, an increased operational range and modern internal technology. It is produced by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau and entered service with the Russian Army in 1992 to serve alongside mechanized armored units. KBP has a long-standing history after their founding in 1927 in Tula and the firm has gone on to produce a variety of anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-infantryweapon systems for the Soviet/Russian military. Several Soviet/Russian-allied nations have also moved on procuring the relatively new weapon system to help modernize anti-tank forces and include Croatia, South Korea, Iran and Syria. The Saxhorn-2 allows for on-the-spot, point-defense against all types of armored vehicles as she is made to be highly portable with thought given to ease and expediency of use.\n\r\nThe Saxhorn-2 system is made up of three major components consisting of the 9M131F missile, the 9P151 launch tube and a 1PBN86-VI thermal imaging sight. The standard operating crew is three personnel which facilitates both the firing action and transport of the Saxhorn-2 system as a whole. Setup of the Saxhorn-2 is roughly 15 seconds for a trained fire team (the launch tube is transported with a ready-to-fire missile in place) however the missile can only be fired from a standing or prone position. Since the launcher is reusable, the fire team can actually supply a semi-consistent rate-of-fire of about three missiles per minute. At least five missiles are assigned each Saxhorn-2 fire team to facilitate reloading of the launcher. Since one missile is already in the launch tube with the main operator, the other four reloads are split as pairs between the two remaining personnel and these are carried in addition to their personal weapons. The Saxhorn-2 system measures in at 980mm with a 130mm diameter. Weight is roughly 13.8 kilograms. Like other anti-tank missile systems of this class, the Saxhorn-2 can also be fixed to fire from vehicles of various types, making for a mobile anti-tank weapons platform when required.\n\r\nThe 9M131F missile features a solid-fuel rocket booster engine that supplies an operational range between 0.08 and 1.5 kilometers (0.049 to 0.93 miles) - for the crews safety, weapons such as this generally have a minimum operating range. Speed at the height of its post-launch phase is approximately 656 feet per second (200 meters per second). The missile is guided to the target via a wire link (wire-guided) that receives commands and course corrections to provide for relative pin-point accuracy. The base missile is capped with a HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) warhead designed to penetrate armor facings. If equipped as such, the Saxhorn-2 fire team can also launch a thermobaric-based warhead missile against personnel or structures. Thermobaric weapons expand the traditional blast wave for greater detrimental effects using available nearby oxygen (as in a fuel-air bomb).\n\r\nIsraeli Army Merkava main battle tanks reportedly encountered Saxhorn-2s when combating Hezbollah forces in the 2006 Lebanon War. While Russia denied the sale of its missile systems to the group, it is believed these were obtained via Syrian connections which itself procured the anti-tank system from Russia.\n\r\nRussia formally designates the Saxhorn-2 as the 9K115-2 \"Metis-M\".

The cartridge has since been introduced into a full line-up of Soviet/Russian weapons including the impressive AS \"Val\" and VSS \"Vintorez\" silenced assault/sniper (respectively) rifles. One of the unique qualities of the SR-3 itself is the very compact form that the base weapon takes on (more akin to a submachine gun than an assault rifle). This makes it highly suitable for special forces use as well as airborne infantry. Production of the SR-3 has been undertaken out of the famous Tula Arms Plant to which a modified form - the silenced SR-3M - has since emerged.\n\r\nThe SR-3 is a conventional gas-operated weapon utilizing a rotating bolt action. The received is slab-sided and rectangular in its general shape with a conventional pistol-grip/trigger unit and forward hand guard around the barrel/gas system. It sports a rate-of-fire of approximately 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 970 feet per second. The weapon is generally effective within ranges of 200 meters but can be used beyond to approximately 400 meters. There are two known versions of the SR-3, the extended design being the aforementioned \"SR-3M\".

The cartridge is based on the 7.62x39mm rifle round though this having its \"neck\" expanded to take on the 9mm bullet - a bullet most commonly found in semi-automatic handguns and submachine guns. The result is a close-quarters weapon with the destructive firepower of a full-length automatic rifle - for the 9x39mm is said to penetrate the latest is body armor while delivering a lower audible signature. Design and manufacture of the 9A-91 was/is the responsibility of the KBP Instrument Design Bureau.\n\r\nDesign of the 9A-91 is quite conventional as automatic weapons go and polymers are utilized for \"non-essential\" components of the gun such as the pistol grip and forward hand guard. This design initiative assists in keeping the weapon's weight to \"manageable\" levels. However, steel stampings are still utilized for construction of the receiver and critical internal components remain metal. The receiver is relatively featureless along the left side of the body while the right side houses the charging handle and ejection port. The 9A-91 features a metal stock that can be folded over the receiver to shorten the weapon's overall length considerably. Optics or accessories can be fitted along the top of the receiver for accurized close-quarters work. The pistol grip is conventional and slight angled rearwards for an ergonomic hold. The grip is integrated with the ring-protected curved trigger element while the trigger sits behind the magazine well. The weapon accepts a straight 20-round detachable box magazine white breaks from the curved magazine tradition of earlier Soviet/Russian assault weapons designs. The firing action is the traditional gas-operation with a rotating bolt unit. The forend is ribbed for a firm hold while only a small length of barrel protrudes ahead. In all, the selected design features promote a rather compact and stout assault weapon suitable for the most serious of police work.\n\r\nThe 9A-91 sports a rate-of-fire in the range of 700 to 900 rounds per minute - on par with many assault rifles. The lower velocity of the 9x39mm subsonic ammunition drastically lowers the effective range of the weapon to under 100 meters. While limited range is a detrimental feature to most any weapon, the type of police work required of elements utilizing a weapon such as the 9A-91 most often times fall within close ranges so the limitation is negligible.\n\r\nThe 9A-91 assault carbine forms the body of the VSK-94 silenced sniper rifle for Russian special forces.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "81874ddc-0b9c-4486-9166-6298367a0c9d", "year_model": "1991", "weapon_name": "KBP A-91", "weapon_type": "Bullpup Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThough born of the same line of KBP-designed A-91-series assault weapons (to include the 9A-91 assault carbine), the A-91 assault rifle is a departure in that it utilizes a \"bullpup\" configuration for ultimate compactness in-the-field. The action is set aft of the pistol grip/trigger group which allows a full-length barrel to be retained within a shorter overall gun body length. The result is a solid Russian-originated weapon that has seen limited acceptance beginning in 1990 with Russian Army and some select police forces.\n\r\nUnlike other assault rifles, the A-91 is built with an integrated 40mm grenade launcher. This weapon fires various warhead types of the VOG-25 grenade series already in circulation with Russian forces and Russian military customers of the world. All told, the complete system weighs a manageable 9.5lbs while featuring a length of 26 inches with its 16.3 inch barrel assembly. The carrying handle is integral for facilitating transport.

Ukraine is another noted operator of the grenade.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "37005fcf-32fd-42c4-b9bf-85737f747ba1", "year_model": "1990", "weapon_name": "RGO (Ruchnaya Granata Oboronitelnaya)", "weapon_type": "Fragmentation Hand Grenade", "description": "State Factories - Russia / Ukraine"}, {"id": "49388947-8170-43e4-8565-447c90d4a1ce", "year_model": "1989", "weapon_name": "RPG-27 (Tavolga)", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Rocket-Propelled Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \tWorld War 2 (1939-1945) solidified the tank as a core component of land warfare. In turn, this gave rise to counter-tank solutions that coincided with advancements in rocketry and portability of systems centered on armor-defeating weapons such as the German \"Panzerfaust\" and American \"BAZOOKA\" series (both detailed elsewhere on this site). As the Cold War between East and West settled into a relatively stalemate following the close of the Second World War, both sides continued development of tank-killing measures with the Soviets developing a whole line of \"RPG\" (Rocket-Propelled Grenade) man-portable weapons.\n\r\nIn the late 1980s, the RPG-27 (\"Tavolga\" = \"Grassy Meadow\") became the latest addition to the family line that began with the RPG-2 of 1954. While the RPG-2 utilized a reusable launch tube, there was a subgroup of Anti-Tank (AT) weapons that relied on the single-shot approach with a disposable tube. In this manner, the operator could carry several of the weapons (typically three) into combat and \"lighten the load\" as the battle progressed. Examples of this form were the RPG-18, RPG-22, RPG-26, and - the focus of this article - the RPG-27.\n\r\nThe man-portable disposable weapon was a technically sound battlefield solution. It involved a two-piece launch tube that could collapse on itself for ease-of-transport (with the ready rocket already inside) and was extended to the fullest when made ready-to-fire. Aiming could be done either through iron sights or optics if integrated depending on the design. The result was an AT measure that, if the rocket's warhead allowed, could repel any modern tank of the day. In the West, this role eventually fell to the M72 \"Light Anti-tank Weapon\" - or \"LAW\" among other tank-killers.\n\r\nOriginating as an evolved form of the earlier RPG-26 series, the larger-diameter RPG-27 centered on a fin-stabilized, rocket-propelled projectile (tandem-charge HEAT warhead) of 105mm caliber and rated against Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) (750mm), Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) blocks (add-on armor protection), concrete / fortified (1,500mm), and earth (3,700mm). The rockets reached a muzzle velocity of 120 meters-per-second when exiting the launch tube and effective range was out to 200 meters with aiming handled by way of iron sights (as such, accuracy was reduced the further away the target was). Overall weight of the complete unit was 7.6 kilograms with an overall, extended length of 1,155mm.\n\r\nThe RPG-27 saw design work take place during the 1980s under the direction of the State Research and Production Enterprise (Bazalt) and production - along with service entry into the Soviet inventory - began in 1989. In time, variants included the thermobaric warhead \"RShG-1\" (\"Reaktivnaya Shturmovaya Granata\") for lighter-armored targets and the multirole, bunker-busting \"RMG\" (\"Reaktivnaya Mnogotselevaya\") offshoots.\n\r\nDespite its lengthy battlefield career, the RPG-27 could only ever count the Soviet Union and ally Jordan as its global operators. The in-service stocks of launchers then fell to the reborn Russian Army with the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1989-1991.\n\r\nIt is believed that the RPG-27 has been actively used by Russian forces in its was against neighboring Ukraine following Russia's invasion of February 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "816d9af6-f49c-430d-9950-705a97dcc160", "year_model": "1989", "weapon_name": "RPG-29 Vampir (Vampire)", "weapon_type": "Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tJust before the end of the Soviet Empire in 1991, the Red Army adopted its newest anti-tank measure - the 105mm RPG-29 rocket-propelled grenade system. The Soviet Army has long been a believer in economical, easy-to-use methods for defeating enemy armor beginning with the original \"RPG-2\" of 1949. The Soviet Army took on the brunt of German armored formations in the bloody fighting along the East Front during World War 2 and the RPG series was developed as a result of these encounters with enemy tanks. The most popularized form of the RPG went on to become the \"RPG-7\" series which debuted in 1961 and continues use even today with over 9 million believed to have been produced. The RPG-29, therefore, went on to carry this proven pedigree into the inventory of the revamped Russian Army of the new millennium. In NATO nomenclature, the RPG-29 was afforded the designation of \"Vampir\" and adoption took place in 1989. The weapon still remains in operational service as of this writing (2012) though it has been joined by the newer \"RPG-30\" and \"RPG-32\" systems now in circulation - both appearing in or around 2008. The RPG-29 has been primarily manufactured by the Russian concern of Bazalt while local-license production has also been undertaken in Brazil through Avibras and in Mexico through SEDENA.\n\r\nRocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers differ highly from their anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) counterparts principally in the technology utilized. RPGs are a most utilitarian battlefield weapon requiring little training and in-the-field support and are relatively inexpensive to produce in large numbers while requiring one operator to use successfully. Conversely, anti-tank guided missile weapon systems are technologically-laden, making them expensive  to procure in large numbers and usually requiring the services of two or more well-trained personnel in their use. These weapons tend to be heavier and larger in dimension than the RPG weapons but also offer up unprecedented armor-defeating capabilities at longer ranges. As such, the RPG has proven the weapon of choice with guerilla forces and irregular army combatants the world over - particularly in war-torn areas that were proliferated by Soviet weaponry in the Cold War. RPGs also make for ideal urban weapons where enemy armor tends to lose much of its tactical advantage in more confined areas.\n\r\nDesign of the RPG-29 is highly basic and characterized by the long-running body making up the launch tube. A shoulder support is integrated for some comfort when firing and a pistol grip manages the action. Standard day optics include the 1P38 series of 2.7 magnification of targets though a night sight can be substituted in its place. The weapon system weighs 27lbs unloaded and 40lbs loaded. Despite this weight, the weapon is designed to be managed by a single operator which is of extremely valuable tactical value in a running fight or ambush setting. Rockets are loaded through the breech and the system is laid upon the shoulder. The operator need only squeeze the trigger to fire the projectile which burns of all of its propellant while within the launch tube itself. The RPG-29 is, therefore, a simple \"point and shoot\" weapon and is relatively transportable. \r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "cc1777ad-26bb-498d-b1ed-0cf4fcb47061", "year_model": "1988", "weapon_name": "KBP RPO-A (Shmel)", "weapon_type": "Shoulder-Fired, Rocket-Propelled Flame Weapon", "description": "\r\n        \tDuring the late-Cold War period (1947-1991), the Soviet Army introduced a terrifying new anti-infantry weapon known as the RPO-A \"Shmel\". This shoulder-fired rocket launcher, considered a flamethrower by Soviet categorization, was designed around use of several rocket types including a primary thermobaric warhead-equipped type (RPO-A). There was also an incendiary rocket introduced (RPO-Z) as well as a general smoke-generating round (RPO-D). The series was introduced during the late 1980s and saw first-actions in the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), both Chechen Wars, and - more recently - in the ongoing Syrian Civil War (beginning 2011) and the War in Donbass (versus Ukraine).\n\r\nThe RPO-A was used to succeed the aging, outgoing line of flame-oriented RPO \"Rys\" launchers then in circulation.\n\r\nThe Shmel continues in service today and fires a 93mm caliber, 700mm long rocket from a shoulder-fired launch tube measuring 920mm out to an effective range of 200 meters. Minumum range is 20 meters and maximum range reaches out to 1,000 meters (though sighting is only up to 600 meters). The system weighs 11 kilograms and consists of the launch tube (with integral optics set and trigger unit), the spin-stabilized rocket and a launching canister component.\n\r\nThe RPO-M \"Shmel-M\" (PDM-A) is a modernized form of 2006 and differs in its 90mm caliber, 940mm length, and 8.8kg weigh load. The MRO-A is a disposable compact form of 72.5mm caliber with simple iron sights. The MGK \"Bur\" is a compact grenade-type weapon system of 62mm caliber based on the RPO-M.\n\r\nThe Shmel rocket launcher series is used (or has been used) by elements in Belarus, Fiji, Georgia, India, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia (as well as the former Soviet Union), Sri Lanka, Ukraine, Vietnam, and Syria. The former Yugoslavia is a former operator of the series.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "0fc4cccb-3d3d-4718-b7d5-00e7b6e9326f", "year_model": "1988", "weapon_name": "RGS-50", "weapon_type": "50mm Single-Shot Grenade Launcher", "description": "State Factories - Soviet Union / Russia"}, {"id": "63cb8530-584d-406d-be47-b890cfd17efb", "year_model": "1987", "weapon_name": "AS Val (Avtomat Special'nyj)", "weapon_type": "Silenced Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AS Val is a specialized automatic firearm of Soviet-era origin - essentially an assault rifle weapon system with a permanent silencer installed for clandestine operations. The weapon was designed by the TsNITITochMash state design bureau while production was charged to the famous Tula Arms Plant, the latter amazingly in existence since 1712. The AS Val first appeared in Soviet inventories in 1987 and has since been issued (primarily) to special forces (including Spetsnaz) and top-level security groups though it has also become a staple of the regular Soviet/Russian Army over time.\n\r\nThe heart of the AS Val is its \"subsonic\" ammunition which works extremely well in conjunction with the silencer component. The weapon is chambered for the \"9x39mm SP-6\" cartridge which is a rifle-caliber 7.62x39mm case with a special \"widened\" neck designed to accept a 9mm bullet - the latter a cartridge very common to semi-automatic pistols and submachine guns. This modified Soviet/Russian cartridge has continued to find growing use throughout other specialized weapon families of the Russian military since its inception. As a whole, the AS Val is key to the stealthy nature required of certain combat elements - where neutralizing unsuspecting sentries or fighting one's way out of trouble without garnering unneeded attention is something of a trademark.\n\r\nOutwardly, the AS Val showcases conventional lines consistent with other assault rifle designs. The receiver holds the major internal working components while the trigger group and pistol grip are well-integrated into the weapon's layout. The trigger is large, suitable for a gloved hand, while the pistol grip is rather plain and not as rearward-angled as in other Kalashnikov-style weapons. The buttstock consists of a metal framework and is collapsible over the left side of the receiver. Its skeletal nature ensures a lighter overall weight and does not impede regular gun functions for the charging handle and ejection port are set to the right side of the body. Magazines are fed just ahead of the trigger group and include 10-, 20- or 30-round detachable, curved box magazines though the 20-round version appears as the standard for the series. The specialized cartridges stacked within the magazine make the magazine deeper than a traditional box. A magazine release is noted just aft of the magazine well and ahead of the trigger component - a Kalashnikov identifier. There is a short forend handgrip set ahead of the receiver and magazine regions. Ahead of this is the principle identifying feature of the AS Val - the heavy duty silencer which appears as nothing more than a featureless cylinder simply added to the gun structure. The silencer is designed and constructed in such a way that the weapon can fire on full-automatic consistently without the silencer assembly suffering any irreversible fracturing in the short-term. A selector switch near the trigger allows for full-automatic or single-shot fire modes. The sights are affixed to the silencer assembly which clears the upper receiver from structural \"clutter\". Therefore, scopes or other accessories can be affixed to the weapon. Sighting does include standard adjustable iron fixtures (rear sector sight, front post) while various optics (including night scopes) can be installed along the top of the receiver.\n\r\nThe firing action of the AS holds origins in the tried-and-true Kalashnikov pattern and consists of a conventional gas-operation with a rotating bolt. As in other Kalashnikov guns, the gas cylinder is set above the barrel. Rate-of-fire is approximately 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of about 970 feet per second. As with most \"silenced\" weapons, range is limited when compared to that of traditional, non-silenced assault rifles - the AS Val managing effectiveness out to 300 meters with a maximum \"reach\" out to 400 meters. This is largely due to the heavier cartridge and sound suppression system, which lower the muzzle velocity considerably. Overall length of the weapon with the stock extended is 35 inches while a folded stock creates a more compact 24-inch form - suitable for close-in fighting. Unloaded weight is roughly 6lbs.\n\r\nTo date, the AS Val has seen published combat actions in the 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars as well as in the short-lived Georgian conflict of 2008. In the latter action both the Russian and Georgian special forces utilized the weapon. \n\r\nThe \"AS\" designation is born of the Russian \"Avtomat Special'nyj\" terminology, which translates to \"Special Automatic Rifle\". The \"Val\" name is the designation which translates to \"Shaft\", no doubt identifying the long silencer that is fitted to the weapon.\n\r\nThe VSS \"Vintorez\" silenced sniper rifle is very similar to the design of the AS Val silenced assault rifle though it is differentiated outwardly by its fixed, hollowed buttstock and a specialized telescopic sight for long-range work.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "9fffc144-74ad-4351-9edc-274b12897ec3", "year_model": "1987", "weapon_name": "VSS Vintorez", "weapon_type": "Silenced Sniper Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe VSS \"Vintorez\" is a silenced sniper rifle that makes use of a permanent silencer assembly as well as specially-developed subsonic ammunition. The type shares nearly the same contours as the AS Val silenced assault rifle which was developed at the same time. Key markers between the two systems is the VSS's use of a slightly different subsonic cartridge, a fixed, skeletal wood shoulder stock and a long range scope. The VSS entered service with Soviet/Russian special forces in 1987 and has since seen broadened use by internal security forces as well as a regular army. Involvement in combat has been noted in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars and, most recently, the 2008 war against Georgia. Design of the VSS is attributed to Petr Serdjukov with manufacture being handled by the fabled Tula Arms Plant.\n\r\nThe silenced sniper rifle certainly has its value on any battlefield. Its inherent nature allows for quiet operation of the system against targets at range whereas the aforementioned AS Val assault rifle is useful at closer ranges. The VSS primarily relies on two key factors in its success - the specialized cartridge and the integrated silencer. The cartridge is the 9x39mm SP-5 which essentially breaks down as a rifle-caliber 7.62x39mm case with a widened neck to accept a 9mm bullet. It is a heavy cartridge and categorized as \"subsonic\". The AS Val assault rifle follows this same design initiative in its use of the 9x39mm SP-6 round though the VSS cartridge is an armor-piercing  grade cartridge which sets it apart. As in the AS Val, the VSS utilizes a permanently fixed silencer over the barrel and this serves to lower the muzzle velocity of the exiting rounds. While this also lowers the audible frequency of the weapon, it also restricts its range - the trade off of silenced weapons. However, the actual audible sound produced by the VSS is something akin to a whisper in actual operation - perfect for taking out unsuspecting sentries.\n\r\nBeyond its silenced capabilities, the VSS is more or less a conventional rifle system. It sports a boxy receiver with the charging handle and ejection port set to the right side of the body. The pistol grip is integrated with the hollowed stock which features two large loops, the forward most one being for the firer's hand. The hollowed nature of the stock lightened the weapon's overall weight. It is fixed so there is no prospect of making the VSS more compact during maneuvers but it makes for a more sturdy and stable platform in the long run. The VSS can, however, be broken down into key components for scheduled travels. The parts are contained in a provided hard case. The trigger unit is large and very Kalashnikov in its function and styling. The trigger loop is large enough to fit a gloved hand which is always an important consideration when supplying special forces elements. The magazine fits into the magazine well ahead of the trigger unit with the magazine release noted just aft of the well itself. The VSS fired from 10- or 20-round detachable box magazines. The forward handgrip is similar in design to the AS Val rifle, completed with a small area forend before the silencer assembly. The silencer assembly itself is basically tubular in its appearance with a rear sight affixed to the base portion (the section meeting the forend area) and a front sight fitted over the muzzle. The iron sights are adjustable and can be used to back up the standard-issue PSO-1-1 telescopic sight which is fitted over the receiver rear and connected to the gun from supports mounted along the left side of the body. Additionally, the VSS can be fitted with accessories or other scopes such as night vision.\n\r\nOverall, the VSS weighs in at just under 6lbs and sports a running length of 35 inches with an 8 inch barrel being used. The firing action is of gas-operation with a rotating bolt. The gas cylinder is mounted over the barrel as seen in nearly all Kalashnikov weapons. Rate-of-fire is listed at 800 to 900 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 951 feet per second. Like the AS Val before it, the VSS features just two firing modes - semi-automatic and single-shot. Effective range is out to 400 meters with a maximum range slightly further (at the expense of accuracy).\n\r\nThe \"VSS Vintorez\" name comes from the Russian \"Vintovka Snayperskaya Spetsialnaya\", translating to \"Special Sniper Rifle\" - which is exactly what the VSS represents.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3b947789-56d2-48c2-bf37-b79a9675725e", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "2B14 Podnos", "weapon_type": "82mm Infantry Mortar", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2B14 \"Podnos\" is a Soviet-originated battlefield mortar of 82mm caliber. The system is of conventional design arrangement and function and has seen service since the 1980s. Design work was undertaken in 1983 with serial manufacturing had from the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant. The system has seen consistent action since introduction, fielded in such conflicts as the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present), and the Ukrainian-Russian War (2014-Present).\n\r\nThe mortar is made up of typical components as mortars go: the launch tube, the bipod support assembly, and recoil plate. The complete system tips the scales at 92.3 lb and requires a crew of four for optimal function. The launch tube is rated for 6lb High-Explosive (HE) projectiles of 82mm (3.2\") caliber and a trained crew can let loose with 30 rounds-per-minute of in-direct fire. The mounting hardware allows for an elevation span of 45- to 85-degrees and inherent traversal of +/- 8-degrees. Anything more than this required complete relocation of the mortar system. Effective range is out to 2.65 miles.\n\r\nThe weapon can be transported by the available 2F510 series 2x1 wheeled assembly or by a dedicated prime mover vehicle such as the GAZ-66 series military 4x4 wheeled truck or similar wheeled or tracked solution.\n\r\nBeyond its service with the Soviet Union, the mortar was purchased by the fighting forces of Georgia, Malaysia, Syria, and Ukraine and has also been seen in use with Lebanese militia elements. Unlike other Soviet weapons of the Cold War period, the 2B14 series did not go on to see widespread global acceptance. Former Soviet mortars were absorbed into the newly-established Russia Army after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and under 300 are believed to still be in active circulation with Russian forces while some 3,000 remain in storage (and assumed available if needed).\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Army has actively used its 2B14 systems against Russian troops and separatist supporters in its War in Donbas in the East of the country. Novorossiya rebels are known to have used these weapons against Ukrainian forces as well.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "2eb335f3-0b16-4bc8-abb6-190c95963073", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "KS-23", "weapon_type": "Carbine / Shotgun Assault Weapon", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile displaying an appearance more akin to a shotgun, the Russians designate their KS-23 as a \"Special Carbine\" (KS = \"Karabin Spetsialniy\") due to its large-caliber rifled barrel assembly (unlike conventional shotguns that make use of smoothbore barrels). The KS-23 utilizes a massive 23mm round which has more in common with the Soviet anti-aircraft projectile than a standard shotgun slug. Considering the KS-23 was developed from abandoned anti-aircraft cannon barrels that failed quality control testing, this is not a surprise for the KS-23 was developed as a specialized anti-riot weapon by reconstituting these \"flawed\" 23mm barrels. The size and construction of these barrels proved well-formulated for the use of special, low-powered projectiles and, thusly, the barrels began appearing in a shorter, cut-down form to produce the new \"KS-23\". The Soviet concern of Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod was charged with its production while design was attributed to TsNIITochMashwith development occurring throughout the 1970s. TsNIITochMash is the \"Central Research Institute for Precision Machine Building\" that makes its name as a primary Soviet/Russian military and internal security firearms producer. The KS-23 entered service with Russian police forces in 1985.\n\r\nAt its core, the KS-23 is a manually-actuated, pump-action slide weapon system that, for all intents and purposes, is a \"shotgun\" classification by Western standards though larger in scale by any respect.  The system weighs in at 3.85 kilograms and sports a running length of 1,040mm with a barrel length of 510mm (in her basic form). Her formal caliber is listed as 23mm which becomes 6.27 gauge in American nomenclature while the feed system consists of tubular magazine housed under the barrel. The magazine can only hold 3 x 23mm shells though a fourth round can be chambered \"ready-to-fire\" and increases total ammunition capacity to four. Iron sights are integrated as standard and the internal firing system concerning the 23mm requires use of a multi-lug locking bolt assembly. The KS-23 has seen various shells developed for its unique design including basic buckshot, solid steel slug, non-lethal rubber slugs, tear gas and flash-bang shells. Militarized versions can add the optional muzzle attachment for firing barrel-launched grenades of various types (primarily tear gas for riot control) as well as grapple hooks and the like for special forces elements.\n\r\nThe KS-23 designation identifies the initial production models and basic security-minded KS-23 form. The type sports a 510mm long barrel assembly which differentiates it from the other KS-23 production marks. The militarized version is the KS-23M \"Thrush\" production model which does away with the solid wooden shoulder stock of the base offering and is completed with a handier, shorter 410mm length barrel. Some examples of this model have been identified with or without a wire-type stock. In either case, the KS-23M ends up being lighter in weight and easier to handle as a result. The KS-23K is the KS-23 completely rearranged into a \"bullpup\" configuration (the action now being located aft of the pistol grip and trigger unit) to take advantage of the inherent internal space generated by the required larger shoulder stock . The new arrangement allowed for an internal magazine of up to seven shells as opposed to the three-shell limit of the original production models. The KS-23K appeared in the late 1990s. The KS-23, in its civilian market guise, is known as the TOZ-123 \"Drake\" but is only available in the tree-shell form and banned in some countries.\n\r\nThe KS-23 series has only seen limited use since its inception - no doubt due to the weapon's very specific nature and ammunition. Nonetheless, she remains one of the most powerful - if not the most powerful - \"shotgun\" type systems the world over.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c4a35d99-8db6-462c-ab52-83a8fd7ef66e", "year_model": "1985", "weapon_name": "RPG-22 (Netto)", "weapon_type": "Disposable, Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tIn the East, the Rocket-Propelled Grenade (\"RPG\") weapon system has seen consistent evolution and battlefield use since the original RPG-2 made its debut in 1954. These relatively simplistic weapons have proven both easy to train with and easy to operate meaning any able-bodied person can be made lethal in its use. The weapons are an economic measure that is ideal against enemy armor, light vehicles, and fortified enemy positions. The RPG line grew out of the Cold War period (1947-1991) with the original RPG-2 and went on to produce the classic RPG-7 and modern incarnations in the RPG-18 \"Mukha\", RPG-22 \"Netto\", and RPG-29 \"Vampir\".\n\r\nThe RPG-22, the focus of this article, was evolved from the earlier RPG-18 and appeared in 1985 as the Soviets were embroiled in their war in Afghanistan. As with other Soviet-era weapons, this system has managed to remain a viable solution on the modern battlefield - even today. In both form and function, the RPG-22 is comparable to the American M72 LAW (detailed elsewhere on this site) and, like the M72, the Soviet model is disposable after firing, limiting it to single-use functionality.\n\r\nThe RPG-22 fires a High-Explosive, Anti-Tank (HEAT) round by way of a 72.5mm projectile out to ranges of 200 meters. Maximum range is 250 meters as the sighting device is pre-marked at stages for ranging out to 50m, 150m, and 250m. The weapon is rated against Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA), concrete, and brick targets making it an ideal multi-purpose weapon. Furthermore, its lightweight (2.8kg) and compact footprint (785mm collapsed, 850mm extended) means that it can be carried over the shoulder of each infantryman or a single infantryman can carry multiple tubes ready-to-fire. The launcher is readied in seconds with the tube extended, flip-up sights engaged, and the trigger pulled. As the exiting projectile is inherently unguided (simply stabilized by spring-loaded fins), the rocket is prone to accuracy issues the farther out the target resides. Cocking the weapon is done by simply raising the rear sight, the operator needing only to lower the sight to de-cock.\n\r\nThe launch tube if of weight-savings fiberglass construction and, internally, it has a smoothbore design housing the rocket grenade. Caps are affixed at both ends of the launch tube when in transport and the telescoping section of tube slides over the fixed, primary cylindrical assembly making up the launcher.\n\r\nAs with any shoulder-fired weapon of this type, the launch tube exhausts its propellant directly aft of the operator meaning anything in the back-blast is in danger. As such, this limits the weapon's usage some when firing from cover such as from a building's window. Once fired, the launch tube is discarded allowing the infantryman to freely move with less weight to carry.\n\r\nDespite its age, the RPG-22 series continues active use with the armed forces of Russia as well as many former Soviet allies, supported states, and aligned export customers including Bulgaria (including local production), Croatia, Georgia, India, Iraq, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.\n\r\nIt has more recently seen use in the Ukrainian-Russian War of 2022.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "770097f4-0414-44d2-aaef-6cc266fa5e4c", "year_model": "1983", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov AKSU-74 (AKS-74U)", "weapon_type": "Submachine Gun / Assault Carbine", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AKSU-74 represents a submachine gun derivative of the full-sized AKS assault rifle.

The AKSU-74 sports a foldable butt-stock (side-folding) and feeds from a 30-round, curved detachable plastic box magazine. Knowledge of this submachine / assault carbine model reached Western sources in 1983 during which time the weapon was already in use in the Afghan Theater of the by Soviet troops in the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989).\n\r\nThough borrowing many of the key features of the earlier AKS assault rifle design, the smaller design of the assault carbine model firing a relatively powerful round necessitated the need for additional compensation to be introduced.

One mission that could be undertaken with regularity was assassination and this led to the development of various silenced weapons for the sole purpose of quietly killing a sole target - be they an important figure or an unsuspecting sentry. Soviet engineers pieced together a compact weapon mimicking the form and function of a small, concealable sidearm known as the \"PSS\" (it also carried the name of MSS \"VUL\" (\"Wool\")). The PSS was known to be issued to elements of the famous Spetsnaz special forces group and service introduction came during 1983. It is believed that the design is still in service today (2015).\n\r\nWhile many facets of the PSS's design were conventional, the one key quality of the gun that stood out was its cartridge which was given the formal designation of \"7.62x42mm SP-4\". It featured a  \"necked\" case was housed the bullet, a small piston and the propellant charge. The end result of this engineering became a pistol that, when fired, could cover all of its tell-tale signs of it having been fired. Since the propellant gasses were sealed within the gun during the action, all produced smoke, ignition flash and noise were contained - reducing the chance that the operator would give up his position. The recoil-operated firing action was responsible for ejecting the spent cartridge and introducing a fresh unit into the firing chamber to ready the process all over again. The trigger was of a standard Double-Action (DA) design and feeding was handled through a six-round detachable box magazine inserted into the base of the grip in the usual fashion. Sighting was through a fixed blade arrangement.\n\r\nBecause of its unique design and cartridge, the weapon managed a limited effective range out to 25 meters. It could - with a reduction to accuracy, reach targets with some lethality as far as 50 meters away.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f0b9a23d-6a7b-4b68-9b70-70db902820c2", "year_model": "1983", "weapon_name": "SA-18 (Grouse) / 9K38 Igla", "weapon_type": "Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe SA-18 (NATO: \"Grouse\"), formally recognized by the Russian Army as 9K38 \"Igla\", is a modern man-portable, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft system. The system consists of the launch tube with integrated optics and trigger unit coupled to an infrared homing missile. The weapon was adopted by the Soviet military in 1983 and retained by the modern Russian military after the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991. The SA-18 is classified a short-to-medium-range anti-aircraft counter for threats posed by low-flying aircraft such as fixed-wing strike platforms and attack helicopters. Production of the weapon is handled through the KBM bureau of Kolomna, Russia.\n\r\nDesign origins of the SA-18 can be traced back to an early 1970s initiative intended on producing a modern, more effective and portable anti-aircraft measure for the Soviet Army beyond the scope of theexisting SA-7 and SA-14 systems then in use. The program eventually evolved into two distinct product goals which produced the interim-minded (and technologically simpler) 9K310 \"Igla-1\" (NATO: \"SA-16\") and the more advanced 9K38 \"Igla\" (NATO: \"SA-18\"). The SA-18 launcher appeared as a follow-up to the SA-14 family though with an all-new missile development. The overall design of the weapon was conventional, including a sleek tubular launch tube which was set over the operator's shoulder when fired. When transported, the system was afforded a shoulder strap. The powerpack, trigger unit with pistol grip and optics are all contained at the frontal section of the launcher. \n\r\nThe SA-18 was adopted into Red Army service in 1983 (the SA-16 in 1981). A major modernization then produced the latest Igla incarnation recognized as \"Igla-S\" (NATO: SA-24 \"Grinch\"). A navalized form of the SA-18 is known to NATO as the SA-N-10 \"Grouse\".\n\r\nThe 9M39 series missile relied on a two-color infrared guidance system (minimizing vulnerability to flares deployed by targeted aircraft) and was propelled by a single solid fuel rocket motor. The missile managed an operational range out to 3.2 miles and could operate at ceilings of 11,000 feet while reaching speeds in the neighborhood of Mach 2.3. The lethal payload of the missile consisted of a 2.6lb warhead detonation reached by both contact and fuse. The missile was nearly as long as the launch tube itself and sported spring-loaded fins for in-flight stabilization after launch. With its new seeker, the missile now held an inherently longer effective range as well as improved engagement speeds. Perhaps the most noticeable improvement came from its self-protection against the latest in electro-optical jamming equipment. As such, the missile could manage a probable kill value as high as 48% against an unsuspecting, unprotected aircraft.\n\r\nThe SA-18 is utilized by a plethora of world powers with many owing procurement to close Soviet-Russian relations of the Cold War. As such, nations such as Egypt, Syria, Iran, Ukraine and Vietnam all field the SA-18 system.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ceb90a9b-c84f-459d-afcc-4ff0415da1d9", "year_model": "1982", "weapon_name": "Accuracy International L96", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe L96A1 is an Accuracy International-produced sniper rifle and currently the sniper rifle of choice for the British Army.

The L96 originally competed successfully against the Parker-Hale Model 85 rifle in the mid-1980's to become the standard British Army sniper rifle, replacing the aged Lee-Enfield L42A1 series. The engineering process incorporated light alloys, plastic and metal into the design. This melding allowed for greater field abuse (the weapon could take a good deal of external punishment but still keep the internal components in good working order).\n\r\nDesigned to achieve first-round hit at 600 meters and \"harassing fire\" out to 1,100 total meters, the Accuracy International L96 sniper rifle has been upgraded with a new x3-x12 x50 sight and spotting scope. Select units also field the L115A1 Long range Rifle (LRR), which fires an 8.59mm bullet, heavier than the 7.62mm round of the L96 and less likely to be deflected over extremely long ranges. The L96A1's free-floating barrel is constructed of stainless steel and can be changed in 5 minutes. The system itself is designed to allow the single user the ability to carry out all but the most major repairs by himself in the field with the necessary tools being three Allen wrenches and a screwdriver.\n\r\nThe L96A1 is chambered to fire the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge from a 10-round detachable box magazine.

The type improved engagement ranges, tactical flexibility, operating weight, and transportability while reducing the required crew by one. It retained all of the indirect fire usefulness of its predecessor, firing 120mm shells of various types (HE, incendiary, illumination, smoke) out to ranges of 4.5 miles. With the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991, the Russian Army absorbed the weapon in its ranks and other former Soviet states elected to retain their stocks as well.

Both series entered service with the Soviet Army in 1983 and continue widespread use today (2013). Production is managed by KBM of Koloma, Russia.\n\r\nThe 9K310 and 9K38 series received their origins in a Soviet initiative to improved upon previous ground-launched, portable anti-aircraft weapons including the SA-7 and SA-14 families which made use of the Strela-2 and Strela-3 missiles respectively. The primary limitation of the preceding series was their consistent unreliability particularly when facing aircraft countermeasures. As the new program developed, it was decided to produce two distinct missile forms - a short-term, improved solution in the 9K310 and the longer-term, more advanced 9K38. The 9K310 was assigned the Igla-1 missile system with sported an improved homing and guidance suite.\n\r\nThe 9K310 inherited the same form and function of preceding Soviet anti-aircraft missile launching marks. The system consisted of a slim launch tube with integrated optics, power pack and trigger group. The missile resided within the tube until launched to which a series of spring-loaded fins emerged from the missile body. Detonation was through contact and grazing fuses while propulsion was through a solid fuel rocket motor.\n\r\nThe 9K310 series was eventually produced across a handful of variants. The Igla-1 was the base missile designation while the Igla-1M was an improved form of the late 1980s. The Igla-1D was a more compact variant intended for airborne infantry while the Igla-1N featured a more potent warhead. An air-launched form existed as the Igla-1V.\n\r\n9K310 missile systems were used in anger during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and then again in the Bosnian War against NATO forces. Their reach was such that it was widely exported and featured in the inventories of over twenty nations in time including many former Soviet allies and nation states such as Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Serbia, Syria, Ukraine and Vietnam.\n\r\nThe 9K310 and 9K38 series have since been replaced (and improved) through the adoption of the 9K338 (NATO: SA-24 \"Grinch\") series with its new \"Igla-S\" missile.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c3d6fe17-eb84-40d7-be77-3908e058d793", "year_model": "1980", "weapon_name": "KMZ AEK-971", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AEK-971 Assault Rifle emerged from the Kovrov Mechanical Plant (KMZ) during the 1980s with design work having begun the decade prior. At its core the weapon became a traditional automatic weapon system firing the usual array of Soviet standard cartridges through a gas-operated, rotating bolt action. Its form and function were similar to the classic Kalashnikov family of rifles and included the over-barrel gas cylinder as well as the curved, detachable box magazine. Where the AEK-971 differed was in its use of the BARS action - \"Balanced Automatics Recoil System\" - which has proven to increase shooter accuracy in successive fire (i.e. burst fire, full-automatic fire) by reducing the effects of recoil. In the BARS system, the recoil effects are moved closer to the muzzle and a rearward action of the bolt and bolt-carrier help to further minimize the effects of \"muzzle climb\".\n\r\nThe AEK-971 was one of several firearms entered into a competition to find the next standardized Soviet Army rifle and this included the competing AN-94 detailed elsewhere on this site. The rifle was eventually adopted, though in limited numbers, and issued to various elements of the Soviet Navy and federal forces but little else in terms of reach has been seen of this design - it did manage to see combat service in the Second Chechen War with Russian forces. The AN-94, despite being heavier and more expensive to manufacture, won out over the AEK-971 in the long run.\n\r\nNevertheless there still remained support for the AEK-971 design which has managed to stay in the fold and deliver several related variants and subvariants. AEK-971 became the primary variant of the family, chambered for the 5.45x39mm cartridge, while the AEK-972 was chambered for the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge favored by the West. This led to a slight variation in the curvature of the magazine. The AEK-973 was the third in the series and chambered for the 7.62x39mm rifle cartridge which gave better penetration at range. The AEK-971 and AEK-973 then begat subvariants all their own, these becoming the improved AEK-971S and AEK-973S (respectively) forms. The pair used an all-new trigger system, three-round burst fire mode, and lighter-weight shoulder stocks.\n\r\nMore modern incarnations of the AEK-971 are the A-545 and A-762. As their designations suggest, these models are chambered for the 5.45x39mm and 7.62x39mm cartridges respectively. The A-545 is actively competing against the AK-12 model as both remain in limited service for evaluation purposes. The A-545 is considered the direct successor to the earlier AEK-971 line.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "901ae8b7-c5ff-4790-979b-205b4380bc77", "year_model": "1979", "weapon_name": "AT-7 (Saxhorn) / 9M115 (Mongrel)", "weapon_type": "Portable Anti-Tank Missile System", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AT-7 \"Saxhorn\" (officially Russian designation of \"9K115 Metis\", Metis translating to \"Mongrel\") was developed to coexist alongside the AT-4 \"Spigot\" series of portable, anti-tank wire-guided missile systems in the Soviet Army inventory. The AT-4 was a large company level weapon system that was fielded with integrated optics, tripod and a large launch tube for the 9M111/9M111-2 and 9M111M series missiles. The weapon system went on to be used by over 30 counties around the world including many Soviet-friendly parties and was produced in the thousands. The AT-7 maintained much of the appearance of the original AT-4 but introduced a revised missile that was lighter in weight, made to modern specifications and featuring a simplified tripod assembly.\n\r\nLike other anti-tank weapons of this classification, the AT-7 is operated by two specially trained personnel - one to manage the optics and launcher and the other to reload the launch tube component. In this paired fashion, transporting the AT-7 system is divided between the two personnel and up to four missiles are carried by the group. The AT-7 was traditionally issued to such two-man fire teams at the company level as a part of the Soviet motorized rifle companies, each company to tally some three launchers each.\n\r\nAt its core, the AT-7 breaks down into three key components - these being the optics suite, the launch tube and the mount (the latter also known as a launch post). The AT-7 projectile consists of a three-fin stabilized missile that operates initially from a booster before the rocket motor takes over after clearing the launch tube. The missile is then guided along a wire attached from missile to launcher which means that range is somewhat restrictive and line-of-sight on the target is imperative. The missile's warhead is a HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) shaped charge and weighs in at 5.5lbs. Operational range is approximately 1,000 meters with a 40 meter minimum (the latter for the safety of the firing crew). Despite the standard issue of a tripod with the AT-7 launcher, the system can be fired from the shoulder. The AT-7 launcher can also be utilized in relatively confined spaces with a safety clearance of about six meters directly behind the launcher recognized.\n\r\nThe AT-7 Saxhorn first entered service with the Red Army in 1979 and continues in operation even today. Production has been handled by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. A newer, modernized version of the Saxhorn - designated as the \"AT-13 Saxhorn-2\" (known formally as the \"9K115-2 Metis-M\") - sports a revised missile that is heavier than the original design but features an increased operational range with better penetrative capabilities thanks to its larger warhead. The Saxhorn-2 entered operational service in 1992.\n\r\nTo date, operators of the AT-7 have included (beyond the Soviet/Russian army) Croatia, Hungary, Iran, Moldova, Poland and Syria. Hungary has been known as a producer of the weapon system for interested global parties.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4d1b83bd-da1e-4cf6-87ca-a3dbfc40a339", "year_model": "1978", "weapon_name": "GP-25 / GP-30 GL", "weapon_type": "Single-Shot 40mm Muzzle-Loaded Grenade Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe GP series of under-slung, single-shot, muzzle-loading 40mm grenade launchers was developed for the Soviet Army rifleman beginning in 1972.

The type was made compatible with the Kalashnikov \"AK\" family of assault weapons and intended to broaden the tactical reach of the Soviet infantryman considerably - matching the American M203-armed infantryman per step. The weapon was designed to fire a standard FRAG (FRAGmentation) grenade, smoke, tear gas, anti-riot baton and a specialized \"bouncing\" grenade and, as such, the GP family of launchers could be called upon to handle a variety of anti-personnel tasks with varying levels of lethality.\n\r\nThe GP was developed around a \"High-Low Pressure System\" in which to handle the resultant recoil effects of the launching 40mm projectile without the need of a rocket-based propulsion system. The system was devised by German engineers in the latter stages of World War 2 and subsequently adopted by the Soviets in the post-war world. Similarly, the Americans developed their M79 breech-loading 40mm single-shot grenade launcher along the same lines and these saw widespread use in the Vietnam War before being replaced by the underslung 40mm M203 series mated to the M16 assault rifle.\n\r\nThe Soviet single-shot 40mm grenade launcher first appeared in limited form under the designation of \"BG-15\" to which then the definitive \"GP-25\" production mark was unveiled. A modernized and simplified form, the \"GP-30\", has since been introduced which has more-or-less replaced the original aging GP-25 series. The original GP-25 fielded an overall weight of 3.3lbs and overall length of 12.7 inches while the updated GP-30 was made lighter and shorter at 3lbs with a 10.8 inch length. Both shared the same 4.7 inch barrel length and muzzle velocity was equal at 250 feet per second, largely in line with Western offerings. In the GP system, 40mm grenades are actuated by a percussion cap type base which ignites the grenade's propellant, forcing the projectile from the muzzle end of the barrel. The internal makeup of the launcher's barrel is rifled to promote a rotating stabilizing effect on the exiting grenade which allows for greater engagement ranges and some level of accuracy at range when compared to smoothbore barrel types. Construction of the GP family of grenade launchers is noted as very robust, allowing for a prolonged service life in the worst of battlefield conditions - very much a part of Soviet weapons design philosophy.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "5b453d2b-b8af-4f7e-9d3b-6013229e9f9f", "year_model": "1978", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov AK-74 (M1974)", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tDuring the 1970s, the Soviet military sought a new infantry assault weapons system chambered for an intermediate cartridge apart from the rifle round fired by the famous Kalashnikov AK-47 and its successor - the AKM (both 7.62x39mm). Mikhail Kalashnikov began work on such a solution in 1974 and returned with his AK-74 weapon chambered for the 5.45x39mm cartridge while many other facets of the design remained faithful to his original offering. Production began in earnest by 1975 and the weapon was first displayed to the West during the November 1977 Red Square Parade with Soviet airborne troops. Shortly thereafter, the AK-74 went on to become the standard-issue assault rifle of Soviet Army ground forces. From there, it saw considerable success in export and local license production initiatives by Soviet states and allies worldwide. Indeed some 5,000,000 were eventually produced with many still in circulation with world forces today.\n\r\nIn addition to the new cartridge, the weapon brought about use of a new bolt component and chrome-lined barrel assembly as well as a new 30-round plastic-and-steel construction detachable box magazine. Though was given to muzzle climb on full automatic by way of a muzzle compensator/brake - making for a more stable gunnery platform than previously seen. All other components were largely carried over from the AKM - a 1959 revision of the original AK-47 of 1949. The weapon weighed in at 3.3 kilograms with a 37 inch length (barrel of 16.3 inches long) and featured a gas-operated system with rotating bolt action (same as found on the AKM). Rate-of-fire was approximately 650 rounds per minute with a 2,950 feet-per-second muzzle velocity. Effective firing ranges reached out to 1,000 meters with sighting handled through an adjustable rear notch and front post arrangement. The AK-74 could also mount the GP-25 series 40mm Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) to broaden the tactical value of the standard infantryman.\n\r\nThe primary, initial variant of the line was the AK-74 noted for its solid wood buttstock. The AKS-74 was a variant given a side-folding skeletal metal stock for compactness, primarily serving specialized troops such as airborne. The AKS-74U became an automatic carbine form of contained proportions to also serve specialists not requiring the facilities of a full-length service rifle. The AKS-74UB was a special silenced version of the AKS-74U chambered for the 5.45x39mm subsonic cartridge. The AK-74M was a modernized version of 1991 with support for new generation UBGLs since introduced into the Russian military and various optics. This version became the new standard Russian service rifle.\n\r\nSeveral full-length variants, modified for night operations with specialized optics, were given \"N\" designations to signify their roles including the AK-74N, the AKS-74N and the AKS-74UN.\n\r\nThe AK-74M was eventually evolved into a more modern fighting form (with increased use of plastics) as the AK-100 family line to include the AK-101 rifle and the AK-102 assault carbine all way to the AK-108 rifle chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO.\n\r\nOperators of the AK-74 (beyond the Soviets/Russians) became Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Jordan, North Korea, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine (among others - see operators listing for full mention). The AK-74 remains the standard service rifle of Armenia. Azerbaijan locally-produces the weapon as does Bulgaria (as the AR-M1), North Korea (as the Type 88/Type 98-1) and Romania (as the PA md. 86). Syrian airborne forces continue its wide scale use. The Polish wz. 1988 \"Tantal\" was a localized version of the AK-74, though since removed from frontline service from 2005 onwards. United States special forces have used the AK-74, this under the local \"M1974\" designation.\n\r\nThe AK-74 has seen fighting action since the Soviet-Afghan War of 1979-1989 and has been encountered during the Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-1994), the Georgian Civil War (1991-1993), the First Chechen War (1994-1996), the Second Chechen War (1999-2000), the South Ossetia War (2008) and many lesser, regional conflicts.

The pistol was quickly adopted by foreign police and military agencies for its sound accuracy and reliable performance under the harshest of conditions. Production was even expanded upon through local-licenses in foreign lands, variants developed that were directly influenced by the original excellent Czech design and those overseas elements bent on outright copies of the illegal kind.\n\r\nThe CZ75 emerged as a commercial venture intended for export, hence the selection of the 9x19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge favored by the West. While manufactured in modern-day Czech Republic, the reader must understand that the nation existed as a unified Czechoslovakia prior to and after the German occupation of the country in World War 2. Following its \"liberation\" and subsequent occupation by the Soviet Union at the end of World War 2, Czechoslovakia became a full communist state in 1948. As such, politics and military fronts were heavily influenced by its communist overseers. With this in mind, it is interesting to note the CZ75's target market essentially being the rest of the world.\n\r\nDesign of the CZ75 pistol was attributed to brothers Josef and Frantisek Koucky while manufacture came under the Ceska Zbrojovka (CZ) brand label. Outwardly, it was a very conventional-appearing pistol for the time, sporting clean, firm lines with a padded grip, large trigger ring suitable for a gloved hand and slide running the length of the weapon. Controls were within easy reach of the primary hand and sights consisted of a front blade mated to a rear square notch. The hammer protruded from the rear of the frame in the usual way and a spur overhung the grip for better support. Overall weight of original models was under 2.5lbs with a running length of 8 inches, the barrel measuring 4.7 inches. Internally, the CZ75 managed a manual safety configuration similar to that of the storied Browning Hi-Power. The arrangement made it possible for the operator to carry a ready-to-fire handgun (cartridge being chambered) in relatively safety. The CZ75 made use of the widely-accepted 9x19mm Parabellum (German) pistol cartridge through a short-recoil, tilting barrel action. The action allowed for semi-automatic fire and provided performance consistent with other modern handguns of the time. As designed, the handgun fired from a 15-round, dual-column, staggered metal magazine inserted through the base of the grip. The handgun then went on to be released in 9x21mm IMI (Israeli) and .40 S&W (American) chambered forms.\n\r\nThe original CZ75 batches were recognized under the simple \"CZ75\" designation while a later batch production effort was added under the same name and completed with lengthened slide rails. The CZ75B was the second major production model incorporating an internally-housed safety for the firing pin and a stainless steel version followed. The CZ75B \"Omega\" was a special offshoot with additional availability in .40 S7W chamberings to broaden market appeal. These models also had slightly modified trigger groups. The CZ75B \"SA\" offered a single-action (SA) trigger group and was available in both 9x19mm Parabellum and .40 S&W chamberings. The CZ75 \"Compact\" was a more portable version of the base CZ75 handgun featuring a shortened pistol grip and shortened barrel assembly and slide. A version chambered in .40 S&W eventually appeared. The CZ75 \"Semi-Compact\" attempted to bring about the best of both worlds, retaining some of the form and function of the original CZ75 model with the benefits of compactness in the smaller CZ75 offerings. The barrel and slide components were both borrowed from the Compact model while the overall frame and grip were pulled from the original CZ75.

The design challenge lay in creating a weapon that could also retain some killing power on dry land which resulted in the selection of a gas operated system with a rotating bolt arrangement not unlike the original Kalashnikov AK-47. In order to succeed in its primary role of firing underwater, the weapon was chambered for a unique fin-stabilized dart/bolt as opposed to traditional cartridged ammunition. The metal dart measured nearly 5 inches long (its caliber officially listed as \"5.66x39mm MPS\") and sported a pointed head and bulged rear (representing the cartridge). The cartridge's specifications were akin to that of the Soviet 5.56x45mm round. The bolts were fired through a repeating action and down a smoothbore barrel assembly (as opposed to a rifled one). The end result was the APS which has been notably used by SPETSNAZ special forces since its inception.\n\r\nExternally, the APS is highly recognizable primarily due to its oversized magazine which is required by the stacking shape of the metal darts. The receiver is rectangular in its appearance and features a fixed angled pistol grip with trigger unit at the rear. There is an extendable twin-strut wire buttstock affixed for shoulder supporting - its collapsible nature ensures a compact weapon for underwater movement. The butt slides along two channels to either side of the receiver. The gas system is fitted over the barrel as in the Kalashnikov family of automatic weapons. The barrel extends a short distance ahead of the gas cylinder. Overall length with the butt extended is 32.5 inches and 24 inches when collapsed while overall weight is a manageable 5lbs when empty and approximately 7.5lbs when loaded.\n\r\nThe weapon's range is inherently limited in water and on land because of the specialized darts it fires. Maximum underwater range just over 30 feet though environmental factors such as depth come into play. On land, the weapon can reach out to ranges of 330 feet though accuracy degrades rather quickly - the internal makeup of the barrel is smoothbore and the metal darts are not entirely designed for ground-based warfare. Muzzle velocity (through the air) is roughly 1,200 feet per second. The APS makes use of a 26-round plastic detachable box magazine which adds much drag in underwater movement.\n\r\nThe APS rifle has been produced under the brand labels of Tula Arms Plant and TsNIITochMash since 1975. Design of the weapon is attributed to Vladimir Simonov. Soviet underwater forces were also issued specialized underwater-firing pistols during the Cold War years - though of equally limited range. The APS was eventually replaced by the more modern ASM-DT rifle which entered service in the new millennium - also produced by the Tula Arms Plant though now for the Russian Army in 5.45x39mm chambering (still retaining the gas-operated action and 26-round magazine).\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "57f0ba0a-7815-4b65-954d-c631d40fd872", "year_model": "1975", "weapon_name": "Beretta Model 92 (M92)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Service Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Beretta concern of Italy has been making firearms since it was founded in 1526, today existing as the oldest such producer in the world. Its more modern semi-automatic handgun types were in use throughout both World Wars and many conflicts in between, showcasing the mark as a standard for other competing handguns on the market. Its first prominent semi-automatic pistol arrived during 1915 through the Model 1915 and this approach was progressively evolved throughout the interwar years and the decades after World War 2 to produce the Beretta Model 1951. From this mark came the classic, world-renowned Beretta Model 92 introduced in 1975. The mark is still being produced today (2014) and has been accepted by a plethora of military, civilian, security, and law enforcement circles for its trusty service. From the basic design has come a rather large group of variants as well, some in various chamberings, making the Model 92 an undisputed global success in the small arms market.\n\r\nDesign of the gun is attributed to Carlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti, and Vittorio Valle.\n\r\nThe Model 92 became essentially a modernized form of the earlier Model 1951 and it therefore followed the same general form and function (including the Beretta staple cut-out slide). A Double-Action (DA) trigger unit was introduced with the Model 92 as was a higher-capacity magazine. On the whole, it remained largely the same Beretta pistol. Its primary chambering was the ubiquitous 9x19 Parabellum German pistol cartridge but forms followed chambered for the .40 Smith & Wesson, the 9x21mm IMI from Israeli, and the 7.65mm Luger cartridge. The basic Model 92 featured a weight of 950 grams with a length of 217mm and barrel measuring 125mm long. Muzzle velocity reached 1,250 feet per second with an effective range out to 160 feet. Due to the variable Model 92 designs and chamberings, the pistol ultimately accepted detachable box magazine counts anywhere from eight (compact models) to an impressive thirty-two rounds.\n\r\nThe original Model 92 actually saw a limited production run of about 5,000 pistols and this manufacture spanned from 1975 to 1976. Later additional production bumped this total beyond 50,000 units into 1983. The Model 92S was introduced to better support sales to law enforcement groups and improved safety measures on the gun with a combo safety catch/decocking lever system now fitted to the slide as opposed to the frame. Production ran into the mid-1980s and its adoption was seen with several military forces (including the Italian Army) and police groups worldwide.\n\r\nThen followed the Beretta Model 92SB (originally known as the 92S-1) and this was a mark developed specifically for U.S. military trials as they sought to replace their aged stocks of the classic Colt M1911A1 .45 caliber semi-automatic pistols with a more modern offering. Its design followed the earlier Model 92S series and all its inherent changes but included the safety catch along both sides of the slide. A magazine catch was set behind the trigger ring for easier access and an automatic firing pin lock was added. The grip shape was ergonomically improved and the hammer revised slightly with a \"half-cock\" notch. The result was a pistol largely faithful to the original Model 92S but finalized as a slightly heavier overall form. A compact form was developed as the 92SB Compact and featured a shortened slide and barrel as well as a smaller 13-round magazine capacity.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c7ed6aab-f7d1-4db6-aa50-6b4d940bc6d1", "year_model": "1975", "weapon_name": "Improvised Explosive Device (IED)", "weapon_type": "Improvised Explosive Device", "description": "\r\n        \tImprovised Explosive Devices (\"IED\") are in-the-field detonating devices designed to specifically injure, harass or kill individuals or groups of people. IEDs have long since been an accepted part of guerilla-style warfare where conventional warfare exceeds the capabilities of rebel-style groups. IEDs are typically prepared roadside or thrown onto the roads as an enemy vehicle passes. In either case, surprise is the key element and IEDs are, therefore, generally camouflaged t hide their sinister role.\n\r\nIEDs have been created by all manner of ways including use of household chemicals and elements or military-grade components combined into the proper combustible combination. IEDs can further be of various sizes with the larger versions appropriately causing the most damage/harm. IEDs can be delivered via simple paper bags and steel pipes (as \"pipe bombs\") to card board boxes and milk crates. Other packages that have been used (particularly in Iraq since 2003) include mortar and howitzer shells - supplying a large blast radius with applicable fragmentation. Such implements can be set off via a timer, timed fuse or cell phone.\n\r\nIEDs have proven exceedingly popular in ongoing actions across Iraq and Afghanistan by members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban whose access to heavy weaponry is limited and must, therefore, by of the improvised variety (ala the Molotov Cocktail). Coalition forces in the Iraq and Afghan theaters have been attacked by IEDs since the respective invasions to which whole infantry fighting vehicles have been upended in massive explosions. HUMVEEs have proven particularly vulnerable in the early stages of the wars to which up-armored variants were later developed. The extensive use of IEDs by the enemy has led to a surge in mine-resistant vehicles being procured by coalition forces. Mine-resistant vehicles - known as \"MRAPs\" - are specially designed to withstand certain blast forces from various angles and provide the crew within with a certain level of protection - often at the cost of the entire vehicle itself.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c3f22c74-9ed7-483d-8778-55eb15074de7", "year_model": "1974", "weapon_name": "SA-14 (Gremlin) / 9K34 Strela-3", "weapon_type": "Man-Portable, Shoulder-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missile", "description": "\r\n        \tDue to the limited capabilities of its preceding 9K32 \"Strela-2\" (NATO: SA-7 \"Grail\") anti-aircraft missile system, the Soviet military commissioned for an improved form which became the 9K34 \"Strela-3\" (NATO: SA-14 \"Gremlin\").  The missile was given more reliable infrared homing seeker which made it less prone to fall for launched countermeasures by aircraft. The system was produced by KBM and introduced into the Soviet Army inventory in 1974. Despite its Cold War origins, the weapon continues widespread use today, proving an effective battlefield man-portable, shoulder-launched system. A navalized form has been recognized by NATO as the \"SA-N-8\".\n\r\nThe 9K34 followed along the same design lines as previous man-portable, shoulder-launched offerings. The system consisted of a slim launch tube with attached powerpack, trigger group and grip and optics. The missile resided in the launch tube until firing to which it would break free of its hold and head for the target at Mach speeds, spring-loaded fins providing the necessary stabilization and course correction. Overall length of the launch tube was just under five feet. The missile (heavier than the Strela-2 before it) maintained a speed of up to 1,500 kilometers per hour and could reach targets as high as 7,500 feet with accuracy (accuracy improved considerably at lower altitudes. Upon impact, the Strela-3 missile could do enough damage to critical components to take an aircraft down. The Strela-3 could also engage aircraft from the front and sides with some success.\n\r\nThe 9K34 system has seen extensive service in armies worldwide since its inception. It was fielded by Iraqi forces during the 1991 Gulf War which saw a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Panavia Tornado brought down by the type. The weapon has also seen use in the Georgian-Russian engagements as well as the Bosnia War. The 9K34 has also proven prevalent across many localized operations on the African continent where access to Soviet goods has always proven easy. One of the most recognized instances of a 9K34 missile engaging an aircraft was on November 22nd, 2003 when a DHL Airbus A300 cargo aircraft was damaged by a Streola-3 missile shortly after taking-off from Baghdad International Airport. While damaged along the trailing edge of its portside wing and loss of hydraulic power, the aircraft managed to circle back and land safely for assessment and repair.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "aa0cfa61-046d-42fb-9cc2-31ce526bc3b1", "year_model": "1971", "weapon_name": "NSV HMG (Utes / Utjos)", "weapon_type": "Heavy Machine Gun / Vehicle Gun", "description": "\r\n        \tFor a time, the NSV multi-purpose heavy machine gun was the standard heavy machine gun of Soviet Army forces. The system was adopted in 1971 to specifically replace the long-running DShK/DShKM series  which debuted just prior to World War 2 (1939-1945) in 1938. Despite adopting the newer design, the breakup of the Soviet Union during the late 1980s/early 1990s meant that the NSV production facilities (and applicable license rights) fell within Kazakhstan territory which essentially signaled the end for the NSV in Russian Army service. Instead, the Russian Army selected the Kord 12.7mm series in its place. Regardless, the NSV continues in Russian Army service (though being replaced with the newer Kord line when possible) while license production of the NVS has been undertaken in Bulgaria, India, Poland, Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia (now Serbia) - ensuring that it remain in circulation for some time to come.\n\r\nThe NSV is chambered for the large 12.7x108mm cartridge, a cartridge capable of piercing light armor protection and literally annihilating a human target to unidentifiable pieces. Such a weapon requires specific tolerances and this, in turn, adds bulk and weight - restricting the weapon to a largely defensive role when mounted onto a heavy duty tripod. If intended for offense - say fixed atop a trainable mounting on a vehicle, watercraft or helicopter as a vehicle gun, the weapon is given more flexibility and mobility. The gun unit alone weighs a hefty 55lb with a 50-round belt adding 25lb. The tripod assembly tips the scales at 90lb which, all told, the complete system can reach weights of 170lb.\n\r\nThe NSV relies on a tried and true gas-operated action in which the arrangement taps gasses of the fired cartridge and channels this into a gas cylinder under the barrel. This pressure, in turn, ingeniously drives the action held within at the receiver, ejecting a spent shell casing while injecting a fresh cartridge. Basically, the fired shot provides the necessary movement and forces required of the successive shot. The weapon is therefore restricted to full-automatic fire meaning that a squeeze of the trigger will result in a consistent intake of ammunition (and firing of bullets from the muzzle) so long as ammunition supplies allow and the trigger remains held down. The weapon is given a rate-of-fire between 700 and 800 rounds per minute which, as an air-cooled weapon, the operator need be aware of barrel overheating. Muzzle velocity is a functional 2,770 feet per second which provides the necessary penetration at range - effective range being approximately 6,500 feet against ground targets (such as an enemy vehicle). The weapon can engage both ground and aerial targets - range against aerial targets limited to about 5,000 feet. For anti-aircraft defense, the weapon can be mounted onto vehicles (such as a tank's turret roof) or on a tripod for a more portable, infantry-level defensive product.\n\r\nThe weapon takes on a conventional appearance with its oversized receiver. Ammunition is fed via 50-round belt from a hardened case affixed to the right side of the receiver. Spent casings a ejected at the left of the receiver. The barrel is unfluted as well as unjacketed though capped by a massive slotted muzzle brake to help content with some of the violent recoil forces at play. The gas cylinder is fitted under the barrel in a rather traditional way. Sighting is through an iron arrangement though the weapon has been coupled to various optical arrangements, particularly when in the anti-aircraft role - though this is largely dependent on the national army in question.\n\r\nBeyond its use in the Russian/Soviet Army, the weapon has also seen acceptance within the inventories of Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland (as the \"12.7 ltkk 96\"), Georgia, India (produced by the Ordnance Factory at Tiruchirappalli), Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Macedonia, Mauritius, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland (as the \"WKM-B\" though in 0.50 BMG form), Serbia (as the \"M87 NSVT\", a vehicle gun by Zastava Arms), Slovenia and Vietnam.\n\r\nSuch a reach has meant that the weapon has gone on to see consistent frontline service in several high-profile wars and regional conflicts including the 1980s Soviet-Afghan War, 1991 Gulf War and the 2001 and 2003 US-led invasions spawning Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d83cf1c2-3177-4e84-89e2-f0c18da8e646", "year_model": "1971", "weapon_name": "Simonov SPP-1", "weapon_type": "Underwater Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tDuring the late 1960s Soviet engineers worked on providing a new kind of weapon for specialist troops operating underwater. This became the Simonov SPP-1 \"underwater pistol\" introduced in 1971. Design of the SPP-1 fell to Vladimir Simonov who also lent his talents to the upcoming APS \"underwater assault rifle\" of 1975 (detailed elsewhere on this site). The cartridge was a joint design approach headed by Oleg Kravchenko and Pyotr Sazonov. Manufacture of the pistol has been through TOZ / Tula Arms Plant and the pistol may still be in service with Russian special forces today (2015).\n\r\nThe SPP-1 fires a specially-made 4.5x40mmR 5.7\"-long cartridge (essentially a small, slim dart fitted as the nose of a standard Soviet 7.62x39mm case) from a unique four-barreled arrangement (stacked as 2x2 square). Reloading involves a break-action system which exposes the barrels near the breech of the gun. Four darts are clipped as a single unit for ease in reloading. The trigger is of a Double-Action (DA) design and a smoothbore barrel guides the projectile at least to the muzzle of the firearm. From there, hydrodynamics are relied upon to keep the outgoing projectile on its path towards the target - effective range underwater being about 55 feet in 16 feet of water. As pressures change in deeper water, range and effectiveness is reduced. This design element limits the value of the SPP-1 when firing out of the water as the smoothbore barrel does not aid in ranged accuracy as much - effective range being about 50-60 feet with accuracy variable. Muzzle velocity is rated at 790 to 820 feet per second. Nevertheless, this is a weapon for specialist troops to be fired under special conditions and in that role it succeeds.\n\r\nThe weapon is not necessarily compact featuring a length of 9.6 inches, a width of 1.5 inches and a height of 5.4 inches. Weight is about 36 ounces when loaded. The large trigger ring makes the weapon particularly cumbersome.\n\r\nThe \"SPP-1M\" model was brought along with some refinements to the base SPP-1 design, namely in introducing an additional spring for improved trigger pull and an enlarged trigger ring so the weapon could be more easily used by a gloved hand.\n\r\nDespite its 1960s origins, the SPP-1 was not publically revealed until the 1990s.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "b69a4a1e-3cd5-4f3b-9318-d757c5cc3b1a", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "2B9 Vasilek (Cornflower)", "weapon_type": "82mm Towed Heavy Gun-Mortar", "description": "\r\n        \tThe mortar as a battlefield weapon has been a mainstay of militaries for decades. In 1970, the Soviet Army introduced a new heavy-class \"gun-mortar\" as the 2B9 \"Vasilek\" - or \"Cornflower\". The system fired 82mm projectiles out to ranges of 4,270 meters reaching rates-of-fire up to 120 rounds-per-minute. With the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s-early 1990s, the weapon passed on to the modern Russian Army and the armies of Armenia and Ukraine. A foreign customer of the product became Syria.\n\r\nFor mobility, the 2B9 was set atop a heavy-duty, two-wheeled split-trail carriage system which allowed towing by mover vehicle or large-scale traversal adjustments by the crew (of at least four to six personnel). A sighting device allowed for more precise firing through up to 3x magnification. The launch tube could be loaded through its breech assembly or down the muzzle. The tube's mounting hardware held an inherent traverse span of 60-degrees to either side from center and an elevation span from -1 to +85 degrees. Each 82mm projectile weighed seven pounds. A recoil mechanism was fitted about the launch tube to contend with the forces at work. A circular baseplate was lowered prior to firing which raised the unit from its wheeled support while the rear of the system was suspended by the split-trail carriage arms.\n\r\nOriginal Vasilek models were the 2B9 series and these were followed by a modernized form in 1983 designated as the \"2B9M\". In 1988, a vehicle-mounted form emerged for use on MT-LB Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) which broadened the tactical value of both vehicle and weapon considerably - very useful combination for the indirect fire support role.\n\r\nThe Vasilek weapon has been in constant use since its inception, being seen as recently as in the fighting of the Syrian Civil War (2011-????) (by both rebel elements and government forces) and in the Donbass Region of the Ukrainian Civil War (2014-????)

The weapon entered limited service in 1970 and continues production today (2013) for the modern Russian Army. The AGS-17 has been used in several major conflicts since its inception including the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s, the 1st Chechen War (1994-1996), the 2nd Chechen War (1999-2000) and, most recently, with Syrian Army forces in the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present). The weapon series has found favor with military forces throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa as well as former Soviet-allied nations in Europe. Notable operators include Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Lebanon, Iraq, North Korea, Serbia and Vietnam among others.\n\r\nDesign and manufacture of the AGS-17 series is attributed to the famous KBP Instrument Design Bureau, Tula (formerly known as OKB-16 during the Soviet Empire years). Design work on the type began in 1967 to which quantitative serial production began in 1971. The weapon was developed particularly to counter the usefulness of the American Mk 19 series which proved so effective against concentrations of enemy infantry during the Vietnam War (1955-1975). The AGS-17 essentially follows the same form and function of the American design for it is an automatic grenade projecting system at heart, providing artillery-like support/suppression firepower over medium-to-long ranges in support of allied infantry actions.\n\r\nOutwardly, the AGS-17 features a rectangular receiver of heavy, durable construction. The action is contained to the rear of the frame with the feed (noted by the obvious \"hump\" over the receiver) managed at the middle portion of the weapon. Belted grenades are fed through the right side of the receiver with the spent casings ejecting through the left. The barrel is short and internally rifled while sporting a small section of finning along its midway point (the barrel is removable). The AGS-17 is typically seated on an adjustable, trainable heavy-duty tripod allowing for both direct and indirect fire as required. The operator manages the weapon through a pair of horizontal grips (ribbed) while the internal action is of a simple blowback operation, allowing for a 400 round per minute rate-of-fire to be reached. Effective range is out to 1,700 meters and aided by way of adjustable iron sights though optics are optional for more accurized fire at range and fitted at the rear of the receiver. The entire system weighs 31 kilograms.\n\r\nThe AGS-17 makes use of a 30x29mm steel cartridge grenade available in a standard high-explosive fragmentation form and an \"improved\" fragmentation variant (VOG-17M and VOG-30 respectively). These are fed through a 30-round belt usually housed in a metal \"snail type\" container fitted along the right side of the receiver.\n\r\nThe AGS-17 received its baptism of fire with Soviet Army forces during the bloody Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) where it quickly proved its tactical value. It was an effective suppression weapon and equally useful in dislodging enemy forces hidden in the mountainsides or under cover.  Within time, special vehicle mounts were in play that allowed the AGS-17 to be fired from utility, transport and armored vehicles. Additionally, an airborne mounting installation devised for Mil Mi-8 and Mi-24 transport/assault helicopters was introduced and utilized to equally good effect. Vehicle/airborne versions could further be installed with electrical operation for firing from within the confines of the vehicle or aircraft.\n\r\nThe AGS-17 is locally produced in Bulgaria (Arsenal AD), China (NORINCO), Cuba and Iraq. In Finnish Army service, the AGS-17 is known as the \"30 KrKK AGS-17\" while Montenegro and Serbia designate their systems as the \"M93\". Current Russian AGS-17 stocks are being replaced by the more modern AGS-30 series - a similar blowback-operated, though vastly lighter, weapon retaining the same 30mm grenade support. Nevertheless, the AGS-17 should enjoy continued use on the modern battlefield for some time to come.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3f29d5fc-3112-446f-8314-ea1e07866c47", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "PFM-1", "weapon_type": "Anti-Personnel Mine", "description": "\r\n        \tWarfare inherently has many ugly sides with one of the ugliest being measures that do not discriminate between friend or foe, military or civilian targets.

Despite an international effort to ban such battlefield measures since 1997, the anti-personnel mine continues to see widespread use in warfare today (2023).\n\r\nDuring the Cold War between East and West, the Soviets developed a new generation of anti-personnel mine which became the \"PFM-1\" - no doubt influenced by the American Army's BLU-43 \"Dragontooth\" anti-personnel mine series used in Laos during Operation Igloo White as part of the Vietnam War (1965-1975).

This solution also fielded a much more limited range, its effectiveness being limited to targets within 115 meters.\n\r\nIn all, the RPG-26 family of anti-tank solutions was comparable to the American M72 LAW, another disposable anti-tank weapon system utilizing a spring-loaded fin-stabilized 66mm rocket fielded in large numbers by the West during the Cold War.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3d8da21e-9e8b-4713-8198-2b52a754af9d", "year_model": "1970", "weapon_name": "VOG-17", "weapon_type": "Projectile Grenade / Improvised Munition", "description": "\r\n        \tThe VOG-17 is a cased 30x29mm grenade projectile primarily utilized in the belted Soviet-era AGS-17 (\"Plamya\" = \"Flame\") Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) system.

Design work began in 1967 under the direction of KB Tochmash with manufacturing handled by the Molot Plant.\n\r\nThe projectile has proven versatile in that it can be used in the infantry-level AGS-17 system as a troop suppression weapon, on helicopters as an airborne weapon (the remotely-controlled \"AG-17A\"), and on vehicles via a trainable pintle mount (or remotely-controlled as in the \"AGS-17D\"). Despite its Soviet-era roots, the weapon is still in service with modern Russian forces and other global players.\n\r\nToday (2022), the projectile is increasingly used by Ukrainian military forces as an air-droppable munitions for various non-combat and off-the-shelf drone solutions. While not an overtly powerful munition in and of itself, it can prove lethal or damaging under the right circumstances specially to unsuspecting, unprotected / \"soft\" targets such as infantry. In this role, the VOG-17 grenade is somewhat crudely attached to the drone in some way or another with a rudimentary release method installed to simply drop the munition onto targets / target areas below the hovering unit.

Steyr Mannlicher developed a local 7.62mm-based bolt-action sniper rifle as the \"SSG 69\" during this period and the weapon when on to stock the inventory of the Austrian Army as its standard long-range precision system. As its designation would suggest, the gun found its official role in 1969 and has been in service ever since while also being adopted by many armies and special forces groups of the world in turn.\n\r\nThe SSG 69 has proven a highly accurate and robust battlefield weapon of typically excellent Steyr quality. A composite stock made up its body with high tolerance metal workings inlaid into the design. The buttstock was padded for recoil comfort and the grip handle well-curved in a most ergonomic fashion.  A forward-thinking, cold-hammered barrel was used which aided accuracy and the barrel's length ran deep into the receiver for improved inherent strength. The bolt featured a six-lug-locking (rear-mounted) arrangement for strong sealing characteristics. Overall weight of the standard model became 8.8lb with an overall length of 44.9 inches showcased when using a barrel of 25.6 inches long.\n\r\nThe SSG 69 was chambered solely for the (non-magnum caliber) 7.62x51mm NATO standard rifle cartridge - a proven performer at range. The action of the gun relied on the tried-and-true, manually-actuated bolt-action arrangement and fed from a 5-round internal rotary-style magazine configuration. The rotary magazine was of particular note and a distinct quality of the rifle, its five cartridges sat within a J-shaped hold when viewing the rifle from its front or rear profile. A 10-round box was also made available. Effective ranges reached out to 875 yards with a maximum range as far out as 4,045 yards. Unlike other sniper rifles, the SSG 69 retained its back up iron sights while a telescopic sight was typically fitted over the receiver in the usual way. A bipod could be fitted at the end of the fore-end as a frontal support. Slings provided areas for attaching a shoulder strap for transporting/marching the system.\n\r\nBeyond its use by the Austrian Army and special forces, the SSG 69 was adopted by the forces of Argentina, Chile, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia (special forces), Ireland, Jordan, the Netherlands (marine units), Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Russia (special forces), Singapore, South Korea, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey (special forces), Togo, and the United States (border patrol).\n\r\nThe base rifle model became the \"SSG 69 PI\" and this was followed by the longer, 9.3lb \"SSG 69 PII\" (.22-250 Remington). Then came the shortened \"SSG 69 PIV\" of 8.4lb weight.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "30300cec-b71f-495c-9f92-e44922b9507e", "year_model": "1968", "weapon_name": "Winchester Model 1200", "weapon_type": "Pump-Action Slide Shotgun", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Model 1200 was a capable pump-action, full-size shotgun developed for a variety of markets including civilian, sporting and military. The firearm was developed by through the fabled Winchester concern by engineer T.C. Johnson in 1964. Production then began in 1965 and the United States military became a notable operator of the shotgun from 1968 to 1969 - in time for the weapon to see combat actions in the Vietnam War. At close ranges, shotguns such as the Winchester Model 1200 could be called upon to deliver a devastating salvo of pure firepower suitable for taking down game, dislodging doors or - in the case of military usage - neutralizing enemies (a bayonet fitting is optional). Additionally, such a system could prove useful in crowd control when combined with \"non-lethal\" rounds. At any rate, the Model 1200 (and the related Model 1300) proved to be an effective and robust shotgun design that went on to find a home through a number of uses.\n\r\nExternally, the Winchester Model 1200 was a conventional shotgun design featuring a wooden, fixed shoulder stock, under-barrel pump-action slide, multi-shot tubular magazine and full-length barrel. The shotgun sported a listed weight of 6.5lbs and available in 12-, 16- and 20-gauges. The standard barrel was 20-inches in length. The system was fed by way of a spring-loaded tubular magazine that could hold multiple shells (between four and seven depending on the model) and actuated by way of a manual pump-action \"sliding\" system running under the barrel - moved in a front-to-back motion. Shells were loaded into the tubular magazine through a port along the forward underside of the receiver and, after fired, ejected from a right-hand ejection port along the gun body. The trigger was set to the rear of the receiver and protected within an oblong ring. The shoulder stock was contoured to make up both the primary hand grip as well as a shoulder support. The operator's secondary hand was used to support the weapon at the front by utilizing the ribbed pump-action slide as a foregrip. Sighting was accomplished by way of a bead sight located at the muzzle end. The militarized version of the Model 1200 was - for all intents and purposes - a straight copy of the civilian form, differentiated by the inclusion of a perforated hand guard, bayonet fittings and swiveling slings for use of an optional shoulder strap. The Model 1200 was also completed with the \"Winchoke\" patented quick-change system  - the first to be used in any Winchester production shotgun.\n\r\nThe Model 1200 went on to be produced in a variety of models beyond the base Model 1200, this featuring a four-shell tube magazine. The follow-on Model 1200 Defender increased the internal shell capacity to six while the \"Ted Williams Model 1200\" was nothing more than a Model 1200 brought to the civilian market through the famed Sears, Roebuck and Company department store powerhouse. The \"Model 1200 Hunting\" featured a 28-inch length barrel with an integrate choke feature as well as a five-shell magazine. \n\r\nThe Model 1200 was updated in 1983 to become the \"Model 1300\" which, itself, was produced in a few varied forms under the brand name label of US Repeating Arms Company, a firm founded by former Winchester employees. Leading the way was the base five-shell Model 1300 followed by the seven-shot Model 1300 Defender. The Model 1300 Marine sported electroless nickel-plated barrel and magazine tube assemblies. Production of all Model 1300s ended in 2006 with the bankruptcy filing of the US Repeating Arms Company.\n\r\nThe Model 2200 existed as a Model 1200 with a full stock and marketed in Canada. The Model 120 \"Plain Jane\" was completed with a birch buttstock and featured a fixed choke system, ultimately marketed throughout various large-scale general department stores.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ec5f8bdc-5fb6-40f6-a4df-7159255da9a6", "year_model": "1965", "weapon_name": "MON-50", "weapon_type": "Anti-Personnel (AP) Fragmentation Mine", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MON-50 serves the Russian Army, and many other global operators, as an infantry-level Anti-Personnel (AP) mine.

Under the Soviet banner, the MON-50 was exported en mass to supported states and allied nations and, as such, sees consistent battlefield use even today.\n\r\nThe MON-50 utilizes a plastic casing and typically takes on a grey, olive, or green appearance. A pair of scissors-type \"feet\" are affixed to the mine's underside which allow it to stand on its own or to be driven into soft terrain (sand, dirt).

One of the greatest threats to ground offensives remained the combat tank - soon embodied by the Main Battle Tank - a heavily-armored, well-armed foe that could turn the tide of any battle (lacking air support). This led army services to heavily invest in, and ultimately adopt, various missile-minded countermeasures for the specific purpose of defeating armor at range. In time, the wire-guided Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) stood at the forefront of anti-armor infantry-level firepower.\n\r\nThe wire-guided nature of these missile-minded weapons rely on signals being processed from the operator's launcher component directly to the missile guidance fit via a physical wire. While this restricts useful effective range out to the length of the wire supply, it offers a basic approach to precision-guided munitions. The operation does expose the operator as he requires Line-of-Sight (LoS) from the launcher to the target in question.\n\r\nOf course this approach is better than the projectile-based weaponry used in previous conflicts which required much closer engagement ranges and held lower penetration values while also requiring LoS to the target. As it was at this point in military history, the missile was the future of warfare and forces clamored to outdo one another and gain whatever advantage was necessary.\n\r\nWhen Soviet authorities sought a new tank-killing weapon centered around the guided missile approach, the Design Bureau of Machine-Building began work such a weapon. The Army required a completely man-portable system also capable of being vehicle- / helicopter-mounted weighing no more than 25lb. Production and operation of the product would have to be simple for mass-production and mass-circulation efforts. Range should be out to 10,000 feet and the missile warhead capable of defeating up to 200mm of armor.\n\r\nWork spanned from 1961 to 1962 and, after an extensive trials phase, the 9M14 \"Malyutka\" (\"Little One\") was adopted by the Soviet Army (NATO recognized the new weapon as the AT-3 \"Sagger\"). The simply tank-killer would become a long-running success with tens of thousands of missiles produced and a myriad of operators relying on the type. It was featured in many of the clashes of the Cold War period.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c4fda2f1-8f5a-4191-8cad-22ab57800d5a", "year_model": "1963", "weapon_name": "Dragunov SVD (Snayperskaya Vintovka sistemy Dragunova)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle / Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR)", "description": "\r\n        \tFor a good duration of the Cold War period, the Dragunov \"SVD\" (\"Snayperskaya Vintovka sistem'y Dragunova\") series of semi-automatic rifles stood as the standard-issue sniper rifle of Soviet troops, allied Warsaw Pact nations and Soviet export customers. The rifle was introduced in 1963 and quickly became respected for its reliability and accuracy with its actions based in the highly successful Kalashnikov series of automatic assault weapons (namely the AK-47). As a semi-automatic rifle, the Dragunov SVD was more akin to a Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR), terminology used today to differentiate a squad-level precision rifle over that of a traditional accuracy-minded sniper rifle (which typically uses a manual bolt-action system).\n\r\nThe Soviets had always been keen on using large powerful, man-stopping cartridges so it was no surprise that the SVD continued chambering for the ubiquitous 7.62x54mmR Soviet cartridge, this feeding from a 10-round detachable box magazine. The result was a precise and accurate weapon system capable of engaging targets out as far as 875 yards.\n\r\nWhile it was largely based on the Kalashnikov system, the Dragunov SVD became a whole new rifle design all its own. Internally, the action was slightly reworked from its long-stroke piston form to a short-stroke arrangement providing a lighter, reduced movement which was required to maintain accuracy. Coupled with a slightly reworked trigger offering  a smoother response and the SVD became the weapon of choice for \"headhunters\" requiring range and effectiveness as well as ease-of-use and general reliability. The base optics set became the \"PSO-1\" series daytime scope (with some limited Infra-Red capability built-in) and this was backed by traditional iron sights (including an adjustable rear notch). The 1PN51 / 1PN58 series night vision scopes were later supported. A wooden stock and related furniture became hallmarks of the SVD series (as well as other Soviet weapons of the day).\n\r\nOverall weight of the rifle was 9.5 kilograms with an unloaded magazine and the scope fitted. Overall length was 48.2 inches with the barrel measuring 24.4 inches long. A trainer shooter could manage to fire off about 30 rounds-per-minute if need be, compliments of the semi-automatic action.\n\r\nAn airborne infantry version was made as the \"SVDS\" and this model featured a folding tubular metal stock to allow for a compact footprint. The night vision-equipped version of this rifle became the \"SVDSN\". The \"SVU\" was a specialized model sporting a shortened barrel and arranged in a \"bullpup\" configuration which seated the action and feed aft of the trigger unit. It offered specialist troops (like Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs operators) better accuracy through additional measures instituted to help combat recoil. A selective-fire version of this weapon became the \"SVU-A\" and this model fed from a 20-round box magazine. The \"SVDK\" was an offshoot of the SVD line chambered in 9.3x64mm. A commercial version of the SVD was manufactured as the \"Medved\" (\"Bear\") and chambered in 9x54R cartridge (then later in 7.62x51mm NATO).\n\r\nPoland was a key operator of the SVD series throughout its time as part of the Soviet Union and ultimately developed a modernized form under the designation of \"SWD-M\". This offering involved the addition of a bipod assembly under the forend, use of a more powerful 6x42 magnification scope and a heavy-duty barrel assembly to fall more in line with a traditional sniper weapon. Romania developed their PSL rifle from the SVD framework as did Iraq with through their \"Tabuk\" and \"Al-Gadissiya\" sniper rifles.\n\r\nBeyond the aforementioned global operators were users ranging from Algeria and Argentina to Vietnam and Venezuela. Some took to local manufacture of the rifle product (both licensed and unlicensed) like NORINCO of China and their \"Type 79\". Finland knew the SVD as the \"7.62 TKIV Dragunov\" and Iran managed a local version as the \"Nakhjir 3 Sniper Rifle\".\n\r\nIts global proliferation meant that the SVD series went on to see considerable combat action during the course of its long-running service career. This has included the Vietnam War (1955-1975), the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Gulf War (1990-1991), the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1999), both Chechen Wars (1994-1996, 1999-2000), the wars in Afghanistan (2001-2014) and Iraq (2003-2011), South Ossetia (2008), the Libyan Civil War (2011) and the ongoing War in Donbass (2014-Present) and Syrian Civil War (2011-Present).\n\r\nDespite its age, the SVD continues to be a favorite amongst trained military personnel, guerilla fighters, rebels and sport shooters alike and will undoubtedly be one of those rare firearms to see the century mark in terms of consecutive years in service.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "626fcbce-7ce9-49c6-af2f-34db76adcaa2", "year_model": "1961", "weapon_name": "Izhmash RPK (Ruchnoy Pulemyot Kalashnikova)", "weapon_type": "Light Machine Gun (LMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPK (\"Ruchnoi Pulemyot Kalashnikova\") entered service in 1961 as a powerful firearm, developed from the PK series of weapons.  Externally, the weapon is essentially similar in appearance to the AK-47 assault rifle.  This similarity is due to both systems being developed by the prolific and highly successful designer Kalashnikov, the hero of the Soviet Union. The success of the AK-47 led to the Soviet military asking for a similar design to replace the light machine gun that was in service at the time - the Degtyarev RPD. So Kalashnikov lengthened the AK with a heaver barrel and fitted a bipod to support sustained automatic fire. Kalashnikov also stole the RPD stock design, which was popular with the troops, and changed the rear sight to allow for windage adjustments.  The 30-round AK magazines were interchangeable, however, larger magazines of 40 rounds and a 75-round drum were needed to satisfy the full automatic requirement. The gun was eventually ordered for the Red Army in 1961 but did not enter service until 1964. Each infantry squad was issued one RPK along with the 75-round drum magazine. Airborne units were issued the RPKS featuring the folding stock.  \n\r\nThe RPK was produced to operate with ease and to be nearly jam free. A major bonus was the commonality of parts with the AK service rifle series. The RPK utilizes a simple gas operated system firing from a closed bolt. Pulling the trigger begins the firing action - a round is fired and gas is produced when the powder burns and enters a small gas port pushing small pistons. The bolt is pushed back and the gas pressure is released allowing the bolt to be pushed forward by a spring. For night actions the NSP-2 infrared sight can be attached.\n\r\nAs with all weapons the RPK has her drawbacks. The closed bolt firing action and the barrel are not a quick change in the field. If the operator has good fire discipline few problems occur, however in combat situations discipline can go out the window. Optimal sustained fire is around 80 rounds per minute - if overused, chambered rounds could \"cook off\" and barrel damage could ensue.  The size and weight of the box magazine is limited the amount of ammunition carried by the weapons crew - very different from the amount of belt ammunition carried around the necks of US soldiers in Viet Nam for the M60 general purpose machine gun.  \n\r\nThe RPK is still in service, seeing first combat action in the Vietnam War while it is being used by terrorists today in Afghanistan and around the world with many thousands having been produced.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3709309d-7ed3-449f-b3f1-8f9b2600d70c", "year_model": "1961", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov PK (Pulemyot Kalashnikova)", "weapon_type": "General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe arrival of the PK (Pulemyot Kalashnikova) machine gun in 1961 marked the first entry of a true General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) into Soviet Army service. GPMGs receive their name from their ability to fulfill a variety of much-needed battlefield roles such as fire support and enemy troop through bipod-, tripod-, vehicle- or aircraft-mounted installations. These weapons also fire full-power rifle caliber cartridges which give them excellent penetration value at range as well as increased engagement ranges when compared to assault rifles.\n\r\nThe PK succeeded the post-World War 2-era RP-46 machine gun (detailed elsewhere on this site) series in circulation. The newer weapon went on to see considerable combat service under a multitude of national banners - from the Vietnam War (1955-1975) to the present-day engagements making up the Syrian Civil War, the War in Donbass and the Yemeni Civil War. Over 1 million units have been produced both domestically and foreign.\n\r\nThe PK is chambered for the proven 7.62x54mmR rifle cartridge and fires through a Kalashnikov-style open-bolt, gas-operated system that has shown considerable reliability over many decades of use. Feeding is through a non-disintegrating link belt in 100-, 200- and 250-round counts. The gun system weights 19.85lb as a whole with the typical bipod assembly in place and showcases an overall length of 47.5 inches. The barrel measures 23.8 inches long.\n\r\nRate-of-fire reaches 650 rounds per minute and ranges are out to 1,095 yards. Maximum range is 4,155 yards. Sighting is through tangent iron sights though optics are supported (including night vision and thermal types).\n\r\nIn practice, the PK has been officially issued as a support weapon at the company level. Its heavy-duty design allows it to fire a much more powerful cartridge when compared to traditional service rifles and even Light Machine Guns. The barrel can be changed out to compensate for overheating which can lead to deforming or fracturing of the barrel assembly and render the weapon useless in a firefight. Its reliability and flexibility have made it a Soviet-era classic - a well-respected and received weapon.\n\r\nThe PKS, PKM, PKMN, PKMS, PKMSN and PKT are all offspring of the base PK design. The PKP \"Pecheneg\" (detailed elsewhere on this site) is a newer PK series weapon influenced by the original and features a fixed heavy barrel and forced-air cooling.\n\r\nDespite its origins in the 1960s, the PK series has managed an active existence into the new millennium. Tens of thousands of copies have emerged from foreign factories as well adding to an already-impressive production total. The availability of the Soviet 7.62mm cartridge has also helped its reach beyond Soviet-Russian borders and many ex-Soviet states and supported allies rely on the product.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "05a59cb6-c218-4700-a666-e9abb5aa7ad6", "year_model": "1961", "weapon_name": "RPG-7", "weapon_type": "Rocket-Propelled Grenade (RPG) Launcher", "description": "\r\n        \tThe RPG-7 (\"Ruchnoy Protivotankoviy Granatomet\") was the follow-up in the family of Soviet-originated \"RPG\" man-portable, shoulder-fired, anti-tank rocket launchers (generically referred to as \"RPGs\"). The Soviet design could trace its roots back to the American \"Bazooka\" and German \"Panzerfaust' launchers of World War 2 and many examples of these weapons came into the hands of Soviet troopers throughout the conflict. The RPG-7, like those rocket projecting systems before it, was devised as an inexpensive and easy-to-produce and operate, one-man, single-shot weapon for the purpose of defeating armor at range. Despite its 1961 introduction, the system maintains a faithful following and its production reach has meant that the weapon continues to see frontline service in a plethora of modern conflicts. Its qualities are such that the series is a favorite of organized national armies as well as rebels and guerrilla fighters the world over.\n\r\nThe RPG-7 is a further development of past RPG variations - from the earlier RPG-2, RPG-3 and RPG-4 rocket projectors - and can fire a variety of warhead types including FRAG (FRAGmentation), HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) and HE (High-Explosive) rounds. The FRAG projectile is a 4lb munition relying on 210 grams of A-IX-1 explosive. There are two major HEAT projectiles in the PG-7VL single-stage and PG-7VR tandem charge. The former weighs 5.7lb and the latter 9.9lb. Diameter is 93mm and 64mm respectively and these munitions can penetrade between 500mm and 750mm of Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA). The TBG-7V is a thermobaric projectile of 9.9lb weight with a listed caliber of 105mm.\n\r\nOverall weight of the weapon is 15lb and overall length is 950mm (37.4 inches) making the system both lightweight and compact to carry. Grenades leave the muzzle at 115 meters per second and effective ranges are out to 200 meters (maximum achievable range is 920 meters). Sighting is through traditional static iron sights but optics are also supported as is a red dot reflex sighting device. At about 50 meters, the operator can achieve hit probability as high as 100% though this drops to half that at about 200 meters away from the target (of course many factors influence accuracy). Its effectiveness is not necessarily in the ability to stop light-armored vehicles but also to provide shock value to dug-in enemy troops.\n\r\nThe RPG-7 is an inherently compact weapon and paratrooper versions are designed to be broken down into major components for better travel. It provides generally lightly-armed troopers with necessary firepower to stop vehicles on approach or unseat defenders. The resulting \"back blast\" of the firing rocket is relatively minimal and this allows the RPG to be fired from enclosed spaces such as buildings and from covered outdoor positions. Its operation is also quite basic, requiring little training on the part of the user, which lends itself well to rebel forces and other less-organized fighters. Despite its sheer simplicity, the influence of the RPG-7 on the battlefield cannot be overstated.\n\r\nThe modern Russian Army relies on the modernized form of the weapon as the \"RPG-7V2\" and its paratrooper counterpart is the \"RPG-7D3\".\n\r\nOver 9,000,000 examples of the RPG-7 have been produced since 1961 by Bazalt, Degtyarev and others. It is locally manufactured in no fewer than a dozen countries and can be found in the military inventories of nearly forty nations worldwide - from Afghanistan and Albania to Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Chinese version is designated \"Type 69\" and Vietnam knows it as the \"B-41\". For Sudan, the weapon is the \"Sinar\" and is produced by the Military Industry Corporation. Bulgaria designates their stock as \"ATGL-L\".\n\r\nAirtronic of the United States fabricates the weapon as the \"RPG-7USA\" and this is a modern incarnation of the weapon complete with accessories rail, flip-up sights, and extended service life.\n\r\nFormer operators include East Germany, Rhodesia, and Yugoslavia. Comparable weapon systems in the West are the American M72 LAW, German Panzerfaust 3, and Israeli B-300.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "bc428218-c264-4839-96ad-96b32d5a5a7c", "year_model": "1960", "weapon_name": "M18 Claymore", "weapon_type": "Anti-Personnel Mine", "description": "\r\n        \tThe M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine was specifically designed to kill or maim enemy ground troops approaching a position from a specific direction. In the Vietnam War, the mine was used by the United States Army with effect against NVA (North Vietnamese Army) and VC (Viet Cong) forces along commonly used jungle trails during ambush missions. The advantage of such a weapon was in the wide dispersal of lethal steel ball bearings up to a distance of 100 yards. In comparison, the other anti-personnel weapons of the Vietnam War available to the US Army was the M67 fragmentation hand grenade, this having a kill-zone of up to 16.5 feet (though lobbed distance was limited to the thrower's arm ability), and the M79 single-shot grenade launcher, a pinpointed weapon sending a 40mm high-explosive (HE) grenade upwards of 1,149 feet down range - though these were similarly limited with a kill range of about 20 feet. \n\r\nThe M18 was primarily designed by inventor Norman A. MacLeod of the Explosive Research Corporation from a period spanning 1952 to 1956. Developments already being entertained as early as World War 2 to which it was found that an explosion could be \"directed\". The Korean War (1950-1953) spurred further thinking into the development of a highly-lethal anti-personnel mine. During the war, UN forces came under constant infantry attacks that included massive concentrations of enemy troops ala the Japanese charges of World War 2. The United States and the Canadian arms industry both took steps to counter these vicious charges by beginning to detail the effects of a directional anti-personnel mine. \n\r\nThe Canadians developed the \"Phoenix\" which delivered steel cubes against a target area from a 5lb Composition B detonation but was limited in range to just 25 yards. Norman McLeod began developing his version in 1952 into the T-48 concept and was presented to the US Army. The Army liked what is saw and accepted the design (with some modifications) into their inventory as the \"M18\". The M18 was evolved into the M18A1 after 1954 to fulfill a Picatinny Arsenal requirement for an improved form. The series as a whole has since been produced by a number of factories around the world in the thousands.\n\r\nThe M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine was developed into two distinct versions - one with a peep-type sight and the other without. The peep sight was devised to help give a Claymore operator a \"field-of-vision\" for the semi-circle blast pattern presented by the M18 when detonated. A training version is noted by its bold blue color whereas operational M18s have an Olive-color appearance.\n\r\nThe mine component itself consists of a plastic case that is concave and rectangular in shape. Along the \"active\" side of the case are the embossed words \"Front Toward Enemy\" while the rear is embossed with \"Back\" to help keep the operator from making a lethal mistake during setup. The plastic component contains a composition of C3 explosive. The concave nature of the mine's design allows for a forward blast area that produces a fan-shaped pattern of steel balls across a horizontal arc of approximately 60-degrees. The steel balls packed within the mine are then projected out from just above ground level by the resulting explosion to a height of about 2 meters with a maximum kill radius of 100 meters and an effective kill range of 50 meters. Wounding has been noted as far away as 270 yards from the blast zone though a range of 55 yards is deemed optimal. As can be expected, extreme professional care should be taken during the set up of Claymores. This is not only do to the mine's inherent explosive nature but the fact that up to 20% of the internal steel ball projectiles can blow back towards a friendly line upon detonation. As such, common practice for M18 setup includes the use of natural earth mounds or hills positioned behind the Claymore to help eliminate or reduce such friendly-fire incidents.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "905b5194-b595-4e69-816d-d491b24ded2c", "year_model": "1959", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov AKM", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AKM was designed in the 1950s as a modernized successor to the fabled AK-47 assault rifle series of the late 1940s. The original AK-47 began life in the latter stages of World War 2 and went on to see extensive use throughout the upcoming Cold War years after it began service in 1949. The AKM became a successful attempt at essentially reintroducing the AK-47 as an improved form that was made easier to mass produce. Efforts were made to deliver an end-product that ultimately became a lighter, easier-to-control and cheaper weapon system that could be mass produced in a shorter rate of time while still increasing reliability. As such, the AKM went on to become the most numerous of all the AK-series assault rifle variants - it being produced in some 10.2 million examples from a combined effort from Izhevsk Mechanical Works and the Tula Arsenal.  In a drastic comparison showcasing the vast reach of the original, it is said that over 75 million base AK-47 assault rifles were made in all, making her one of the most successful firearms of all time - though the AKM would not reach these lofty production goals she would forge her own successful legacy in time. The AKM saw combat actions in a myriad of operations concerning the Vietnam War and other regional conflicts around Southeast Asia to follow as well as finding use in the Iran-Iraq War, the First Chechen War, the Persian Gulf War and Operation Enduring Freedom to name a few hotspots. Despite it being formally replaced by the AK-74 assault rifle line of 1974, the AKM - on some areas of the world - still remains a frontline weapons system for many nations the world over, even seeing limited use with Russian forces today. Like the original AK-47, the AKM was designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov, the iconic Soviet arms designer.\n\r\nThe AK-47 was a revolutionary design in her own time, owing some of her success to research from the captured German wartime assault rifle - the MP43/MP44/StG44 Sturmgewehr (meaning \"Storm Rifle\", leading to the use of the phrasing \"Assault Rifle\") - generally regarded as the \"Father of Assault Rifles\". Interestingly, Adolf Hitler was not keen on its design at the beginning of its development and pressured for more submachine guns to go into production. As such, StG44 development by the German Armament Office continued under the guise that it was a submachine gun to cover its true battlefield nature. While the AK-47 (and the American M16 for that matter) borrowed much of the successful concepts behind the German wartime StG44, it was mechanically a Russian design. The AK-47, despite its designation (implying the service year of 1947), was actually not formally accepted into Soviet Army service until 1949. Once operational, it proved something of a departure from the wartime implements fielded by the Soviet Union during World War 2 - weapon systems that were hurriedly shuffled out of factories in less than desirable finishes utilizing cheap construction methods to meet production goals. The AK-47 sported somewhat elegant wooden furniture at points and utilized more traditional construction techniques, having her solid steel receiver machined to form. However, this certainly proved a more expensive weapon to produce in the long run especially where \"mass production\" and the \"Soviet Army\" were concerned. As such, the assault rifle series received something of a revision by the middle of the 1950s, this to become the \"AKM\".\n\r\nThe AKM - designated with the \"M\" to signify its \"Modernized\" nature - brought construction methodology back to the more economic stamped steel to help improve production speed and lower costs. The polished steel bolt was now \"Parkerized\", meaning that it was protected over from corrosion and resistance through the electromechanical process of phosphate conversion coating over that of the original AK-47's polished steel. The AKM was designed to accept a bayonet system that could be converted to an in-the-field wire cutter, a presumably novel concept that came into heavy use once in practice and subsequently copied by other manufacturers thereafter. The muzzle was revised to feature a lower \"lip\" extension to act as a simple counterweight to combat the effects of the AK-47's notorious muzzle climb and relative uncontrollability during full-automatic fire. The wooden stock was hollowed out to further reduce weight - allowing for increased two-handed precision control on the part of the operator. The bolt carrier and bolt itself - though manufactured in a slightly different style - are said to be interchangeable with that of the original AK-47 series and the chrome-lined barrel remained intact.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "22121ee7-f932-4392-8725-be4a5ffc5ffc", "year_model": "1959", "weapon_name": "Kalashnikov AKMS (AKM-S)", "weapon_type": "Assault Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe AKMS is a major variant of the AKM assault rifle line. The AKM itself is nothing more than the 1940's era AK-47 assault rifle modernized with mass-production techniques in mind. As such, the AKM featured stamped steel construction as opposed to the original's machined steel form. Additionally, the original steel bolt was \"Parkerized\" to make it more resistant to wear and tear. The resulting AKM was debuted in 1959 and went on to become the most quantitative version of the AK-47 assault rifle line. The AKMS is wholly based on the AKM model though differentiated by its use of a folding metal buttstock over that of the original's fixed solid wooden butt. The metal folding butt is hinged along both sides of the rear receiver and, when collapsed, makes for a more compact weapon.\n\r\nThe AKMS features an empty weight (sans magazine) of 7lbs, 13oz. Its running length is 35.24 inches (895mm) with the buttstock fully extended and 25.87 inches (657mm) with the buttstock folded over the receiver. The barrel is 16.34 inches (415mm) in length with 4-grooves and a right-hand twist. Like the AKM, the AKMS is chambered to fire the 7.62x39mm M1943 Soviet cartridge from a 30-round curved detachable box magazine. Rate-of-fire is listed at 775 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 2,330 feet per second. The AKMS retains the Kalashnikov quality of using wooden furniture at the pistol grip and forward hand grip.\n\r\nOverall, however, the AKMS stays true to the AKM assault rifle - detailed elsewhere on this site. The AKMS designation may also appear in some nomenclature as \"AKM-S\".\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "fa18a3b0-7620-4130-8f99-2e57680a7b36", "year_model": "1951", "weapon_name": "Makarov PM (Pistol Marakova)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Makarov PM (\"Pistolet Makarova\") was designed and developed to replace the Soviet World War 2-era Tokarev TT-33 series semi-automatic pistol. The PM was based on the excellent qualities of the German Walther PP, a family of blow-back operated pistols appearing in 1935 and seeing extensive action throughout World War 2. The type proved of such a most excellent design that it led to both legal and illegal production copies of the type in the decades following its introduction. The Makarov PM was one such illegal copy and entered service in 1951. Despite its 1950s origins, it can still be found in the active Russian inventory as well as in use with other armies worldwide.\n\r\nDesign of the PM was attributed to none other than Nikolay Makarov, a firearms engineer having graduated from the Tula State University. Makarov would go on to claim designs leading to the operational acceptance of the AM-23 cannon, the 9K111 \"Fagot\" man-portable missile launcher and the 9M113 \"Konkurs\" wire-guided missile. However, the Makarov PM would be his first true claim to fame for the Soviet Army. Production of his PM pistol would be handled in the Soviet Union by Izhevsk Mechanical Factory.\n\r\nA design competition was held by Soviet authorities looking to replace the outgoing TT-33 series pistol. Makarov selected the Walther 9mm Ultra round as his starting point and developed his gun around it. The ammunition in the Soviet inventory would take the applicable name of \"9x18mm Makarov\". The 9mm Makarov was similar in some respects to the 9mm Short cartridge with featured a longer casing. This produced a pistol cartridge that proved shorter than the 9mm Parabellum and made for a very unique - if decidedly Soviet - cartridge design overall. This allowed the some level of protection in ensuring that the pistol could only work with Soviet \"in-house\" ammunition and could not be used in numbers against their original owners in a time of full scale war. In the end, the 9mm Makarov was essentially the largest cartridge size applicable to safely firing from the blowback operation system.\n\r\nDesign of the receiver was nothing more than simply following the lines of the original Walther PP pistol but to a slightly larger scale. The pistol measured in at 160mm with a 98mm barrel assembly featuring four grooves and a right-hand twist. The magazine was a spring-loaded 8-round detachable box that was conventionally inserted in through the bottom of the hand grip. Muzzle velocity was rated at 1,070 feet per second and the firing operation was, of course, blowback in nature. The trigger system offered both double-action and single-action operation and effective range was listed out to 50 meters. Some specialized models were later equipped with magazine counts of 10- and 12-rounds. Sighting was accomplished by way of a bladed front and an adjustable notch rear sight. Overall, the PM exhibited very well-countered and clean lines throughout, featuring some vertical ribbing near the main portion of the receiver. The trigger was curved forward and protected in an oblong trigger ring. Safety and other pertinent mechanical functions were set along the left side of the receiver within reach of the operator's thumb. The slide featured slab sides and nicely curved upper and lower surfaces. The rounded hammer spur protruded from the rear of the receiver ever so slightly but was still noticeable. The ejection port was fitted along the right side of the receiver, launching spent shell casings upwards and away from the operator.\n\r\nThe operator initiated the firing action by pulling back on the slide to cock the hammer and introduce a fresh cartridge into the firing chamber. Semi-automatic action occurred after the firing of each round as the pistol was automatically recocked and the chamber reloaded with a fresh cartridge. The operator could then let-off as many rounds as were available. Upon emptying of the magazine, the slide locked open for prevention of subsequent firing and to visibly inform the operator that a reload was required. The empty magazine was released via a release lever at the base of the pistol grip.\n\r\nThe Makarov PM was revised to become the Makarov PMM in 1990. This version elevated the muzzle velocity of the original action. The hand grip was modified for better ergonomics and the firing chamber saw grooves added. A 12-round magazine was also introduced.\n\r\nBeyond manufacture of the gun by IMF, the PM was produced to foreign markets by notable licensed  contributors Ernst Thaelmann / Simson (Suhl) of Germany, Arsenal of Bulgaria and NORINCO of China. Notable operators would go on to include Afghanistan, China (as the Type 59 of 1959), Cuba, East Germany, Georgia, Iraq, Laos, North Korea, Poland, Syria and Ukraine among others.\n\r\nCivilian market versions of the PM soon appeared and similar versions made their way out of both Hungary and Poland. When the Berlin Wall fell in Germany, the unified country had thousands of existing Makarov PM pistols to manage from the joining East German military and security forces.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "90ffff0f-e58b-45fe-84af-b14b394f2bb2", "year_model": "1951", "weapon_name": "Stechkin APS (Automatic Pistol Stechkin)", "weapon_type": "Selective-Fire Service Pistol / Machine Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tIt has always been something of a challenge to equip logistical, special role and second-line troops in warfare. The role is typically taken up by the submachine gun but there are times when an even handier, portable assault weapon is required. During the Cold War (1947-1991) between the East and the West, the Soviet Union sought to solve this issue within their ranks and called on local industry to develop a new close-quarters weapon. One entry into this competition became the Stechkin, an automatic pistol with qualities more akin to a machine pistol - the bridge between a semi-automatic handgun and a submachine gun. The Stechkin's formal name was \"Avtomaticheskiy Pistolet Stechkina\" or \"APS\", this literally translating to \"Automatic Pistol Stechkin\".\n\r\nIgor Stechkin was credited with the design of the pistol, hence it bears his name, and work began in the late-1940s and continued into the early-1950s.\n\r\nAt the core of the design was a blowback system of operation which centered on the 9x18mm Makarov Soviet pistol cartridge. The pistol had a selective-fire capability and could reach out, with some accuracy, to 655 feet while maintaining a rate-of-fire of 750 rounds-per-minute. Muzzle velocity of the outgoing bullet reached 1,115 meters-per-second. To promote better accuracy while in full-automatic fire, there was an optional solid shoulder stock attached to the base of the grip. Sighting was through an iron arrangement and the sidearm more or less mimicked in appearance the various John Browning-inspired semi-automatic service pistols of the period.\n\r\nAfter official evaluations and trials, this automatic pistol was formally adopted for service in 1951. Serial production was had through the Vytatsky Polyany Machine-Building Plant. Production of the APS pistol spanned from 1951 until 1958 and issuance was to vehicle and artillery crews as well as some officer-level candidates. Security forces soon took up the type and it was offered up for sale on the foreign market where takers were aplenty.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3cfb48d7-d458-4a6a-8626-a58acf0bd15f", "year_model": "1949", "weapon_name": "Degtyarev KPV-14.5 (Krupnokaliberniy Pulemyot Vladimirova)", "weapon_type": "Heavy Machine Gun (HMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tIn the post-World War 2 period, the Soviet Army entered a phase of massive modernization and rearmament that included introduction of a new heavy-caliber machine gun system - the \"KPV-14.5\" (KPV = \"Krupnokaliberniy Pulemyot Vladimirova\"). The weapon was in development as far back as 1944 and chambered for fire the same massive 14.5x114mm cartridge used by the wartime Simonov PTRS and Degtyaryov PTRD Anti-Tank Rifles (ATRs). Since its introduction in 1949, the KPV has gone on to see fielding as a vehicle mounted/coaxial machine gun, dedicated Anti-Aircraft (AA) gun, and naval/watercraft machine gun.\n\r\nThe KPV has a cylindrical receiver with a perforated jacket (for air-cooling) set over the barrel and conical flash hider attached to the muzzle. The complete weapon weighs 108lb and features a length of 78\" with the barrel assembly measuring 53\" long. Internally, the action is of short-recoil and feeding is through 40-round belts. Simplicity is key to the internals of the weapon, allowing for ease of cleaning, repair, and replacement with little formal training. The barrels are chromiun-lined for durability and is designed for quick-changing when hot. Sighting is through standard iron fittings but the weapon does support optics for accurized ranged fire.\n\r\nThe 14.5 bullets exit the barrel at 3,300 feet-per-second and can reach ranges of 4,000 meters (3,000 meters effective). Rate-of-fire is 600 rounds-per-minute.\n\r\nThree types of cartridges are supported in the KPV: the B-32 round is an Armor-Piercing (AP) incendiary-type with a tungsten core useful in penetrating the armor of modern light vehicles. The BZT cartridge is similar but carrier a steel core and the MDZ cartridge is High-Explosive (HE) incendiary round for general purpose usage.\n\r\nOver the decades, the KPV has earned a reputation for simplicity, reliability, and durability to the point that it has been adopted by a myriad of national powers - from Afghanistan and Albania to Vietnam and Zimbabwe. It has seen combat action from the Korean War (1950-1953) and the Vietnam War (1955-1975) to modern day entanglements such as the Libyan Civil War (2011) and the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present). This sort of reach has kept the weapon in production since 1949.\n\r\nThe \"KPVT\" is the vehicle version derived from the KPV design and is utilized in both trainable (pintle-mounted) and coaxial weapon mountings on tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs). Changes to the gun include a heavier-duty barrel jacket and a reduced-length receiver but the basic efficient and lethal function of the weapon remains. This form feeds from a 50-round belts as well.\n\r\nThe KPV machine gun is also the featured weapon aboard the ZPU series (ZPU-1, ZPU-2, and ZPU-4) of towed anti-aircraft systems. The ZPU-1 is a single-gunned system while the ZPU-2 and ZPU-4 utilized two and four guns, respectively, and these products have also seen widespread adoption by Soviet-aligned states and nations.\n\r\nDespite its Cold War origins, the KPV series of heavy machine guns is still used worldwide - a testament to its excellent design. The modern Russian Army relies on the type as do many foreign armies, security forces, and rebel groups. China produces the machine gun as the Type 75-1.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "9c0dd7f9-5f0d-4cd8-8e1e-c4a6cd8f0d00", "year_model": "1945", "weapon_name": "Simonov SKS (Samozaryadniy Karabin sistemi Simonova)", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic, Self-Loading Carbine", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet-produced SKS, or the Samozaryadniy Karabin sistemi Simonova, was the design of Sergei Gavrilovish Simonov and is sometimes designated as the Simonov SKS. The system is a simple self-loading, short-stroke gas piston-operated, tilting bolt weapon and fires the 7.62x39mm M1943 rifle round.\n\r\nThe SKS was, in fact, the first Soviet weapon to be manufactured after the acceptance of the 7.62x39mm M1943 round, also referred to as an 'intermediate' cartridge. Many assume that the development of this round stemmed directly from experimentation and research of captured German MP44 guns from the Second World War - which utilized a similar 'short' round in the form of the 7.92mm.\n\r\nThe SKS system, in itself, is a basic weapon system with very little flair. It is a robust and well-constructed weapon that has been found to be easy to operate, though some have questioned the weight of the weapon for such a small round. The 7.62mm round can be box-fed from a standard 10-round magazine or fed by hand in single round loading. An integrated bayonet system is attached via a hinged connection underneath the barrel and can be folded out or stored at the user's discretion. Well-though out construction means that the weapon can be field-stripped in a short amount of time as well, either for repair, replacement of parts or for cleaning.\n\r\nProduced in large numbers in the Soviet Union and for its satellite states, the SKS ensured itself a place in firearms history. To date, the SKS has become an increasingly popular weapon for sport or self-defense in the United States, where it is classified as an antique relic and thusly can be sold with most of the military accessories intact. The 10-round capacity of the weapon in some areas is increased to 30 rounds via secondary market magazines and slight modification to the system.\n\r\nThe SKS has also been produced by Yugoslavia as the M59, in China as the Type 56, in North Korea as the Type 63 and in former East Germany as the Karabiner-S, all maintaining the basic components of the base Soviet SKS.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "65308699-ce93-4af4-a78e-7030dcc50795", "year_model": "1942", "weapon_name": "PPS-42 / PPS-43", "weapon_type": "Submachine Gun (SMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe PPS submachine gun was designed by Leningrad engineer A. I. Sudayev in 1942. Leningrad was encircled by the might of the German Army to the south and the German-allied Finns to the north. Since Leningrad represented an industrial region for the Soviet Union, the city - with many thousands dying to starvation - was still producing its Red Army tanks and guns in their factories across the city. \n\r\nThe PPS-42 was developed with cost-effectiveness in mind, utilizing sheet metal stampings wherever possible. The resulting weapon proved simple to use and operate and became a staple submachine gun for the Red Army up through the end of the war (its use still continues in some form today). More importantly, the weapon was quick to produce and get to the frontlines, so much so in fact, that many-a-tank and infantry weapon were shipped straight from the factories into the hands of Soviet soldiers.  The PPS was produced in two major variants - as the PPS-42 and PPS-43 - both detailed below.\n\r\nThe PPS-42 was born out of need during the siege. The designation reflected the initial year of production for the weapon (1942). Specifications for the PPS-42 stated a weight of 6.5lbs. The submachine gun featured an overall length of 35.7 inches with the stock extended and a length of 25.2 inches with the stock folded. The weapon was fitted with a barrel (right-hand, 4-grooved) length of 10.7 inches. Over 45,000 PPS-42 systems were produced before eventual replacement by the more economic and improved PPS-43 series. An effective rate-of-fire of 100 rounds-per-minute was possible along with a cyclic rate-of-fire of 600 rounds-per-minute. The weapon held an effective range out to 492 feet with a maximum range out to 656 feet.\n\r\nThe PPS-43 represented an improved and cheaper-to-produce form of the base PPS-42. As success always dictated production in a time of war, the PPS-42 was forged into the equally successful PPS-43. Mass production began in the middle of 1943 and the PPS-43 became a standard Soviet Army weapon throughout the rest of World War 2. Cost-cutting methods included the use of less machine operations in the production process, bringing the overall production cost of the weapon down substantially. Other major modifications included the shortening of the barrel and folding stock.\n\r\nSpecifications for the PPS-43 reflected a weight of 6.7lbs. The submachine gun features an overall length of 32.3 inches with the stock extended and a length of 24.2 inches with the stock folded. The weapon has a barrel (right-hand, 4-grooved) length of 9.6 inches. Like the PPS-42, the PPS-43 had an effective rate-of-fire of 100 rounds-per-minute was possible along with a cyclic rate-of-fire of 600 rounds-per-minute. The weapon held an effective range out to 492 feet with a maximum range out to 656 feet.\n\r\nBoth weapons fired the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge - the same cartridge used in the Tokarev TT-30 (M1930) pistol. Fire operation was accomplished through automatic blowback with an open bolt. Both weapons also fired from the same curved 35-round detachable box magazine. Despite their similarities with the PPSh-41, neither of the PPS submachine guns were designed to accept the PPSh-41 magazines including its ammunition drum forms. The PPS-42 and PPS-43 models both featured a folding metal stock, which sat over the receiver and brought the overall length of the weapon down to a more compact manageable size. The magazine well was also extended from the body of the weapon to act as a makeshift foregrip for two-handed control. A distinct design feature of both PPS models was the forward position of the magazine, sitting a good distance away from the pistol grip and trigger group. A muzzle break and perforated heat shield were part of the integrated body components as were a pair of iron sights. The sights consisted of a forward-mounted fixed blade and a rear-fitted flip sight.\n\r\nAs can be expected with Soviet equipment achieving any level of success, the PPS series was produced in quantity throughout the Warsaw Pact as well as allied nations of the Soviet Union. The submachine gun was produced in China as the Type 54 and in Finland as the M/44. The M/44 served as the basis for the Spanish DUX-53 and DUX-59 submachine guns used in West Germany. Vietnam produced the submachine gun as the K-50M based on the Chinese Type 54. Poland produced the PPS-43 under license and also offered a modified form of the submachine gun as the PPS wz.43/52.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "67008e4e-6b3d-43fe-b2d9-aee447c07762", "year_model": "1940", "weapon_name": "Tokarev SVT-40", "weapon_type": "Self-Loading, Semi-Automatic Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tSmall arms ingenuity was an area that the Soviets held something of an advantage in over their German counterpart in the decade leading up to World War 2. One keen example of this was in the AVS36 - Avtomaticheskaia Vintovka Simonova - designed by S.G. Simonov - a self-loading service rifle with semi-automatic fire, giving the standard infantryman a distinct advantage in sustained fire over that of those still using bolt-action rifles. A soldier with an automatic rifle and healthy ammunition count made for a more efficient fighting unit and, in collection with other battlefield implements, provided much in the way of tactical flexibility. However, the AVS36 was a complex beast that did not lend itself well to the rigors of fighting - it proved prone to failure, particularly of her internal moving parts, when firing the powerful 7.62x54R Russian cartridge. Additionally, general issues with dirt and dust making their way inside further complicated operation. As such, the AVS36 was a short-lived \"success\" that eventually gave way to the SVT-38 series designed by Tokarev.\n\r\nThe SVT-38 (Samozariadnyia Vintovka Tokareva) was brought online in 1938 and immediately replaced the AVS36 series in Red Army service. The weapon system was from the mind of F.V. Tokarev who also delivered the useful TT series of pistols in the early 1930s. The SVT-38 featured a gas-operated firing action with a locking block cammed downwards against a cut recess found on the base of the receiver. The stock was a two-piece unit while the barrel was capped with a six-baffled muzzle brake to help contend with recoil. A ten-round detachable magazine was fitted underneath the receiver, ahead of the trigger unit and the forward wooden handguard was complimented by a sheet steel covering over the barrel to protect the firer's aiming hand. A cleaning rod was rather unusually affixed to the right side of the buttstock. \n\r\nHowever, despite being the \"newer\" of the two designs, the SVT-38 was nary an improvement over the AVS36 series for it suffered from the same fragile nature of its forerunner. The fragility stemmed from a design attempt to keep the new rifle as light as possible and this, unfortunately, led to its inherently powerful firing action (and subsequent recoil) literally breaking the internal components apart. Additionally, as the AVS36 before it, SVT-38 components also suffered from the general rigors of everyday combat that included exposure to dust, dirt, debris and generally accepted abuse. In 1941, the six-baffled muzzle brake was refitted with a two-baffled design to help offset some of the recoil and muzzle blast while several were also modified with mounts for the fitting of scopes for the sniper role. Regardles, the SVT-38 was a limited improvement and would only see production into 1940 before being replace by the similarly-minded SVT-40.\n\r\nThe SVT-40 sported a heavy wood frame (single banded as opposed to double in the SVT-38) with a protruding metal barrel system, integrated ergonomic  grip and attached buttstock. The wooden forend, shortened on the SVT-40, was slotted along the sides for a better forward grip and there were four horizontal vents cut into the upper forward portions for heat dissipation of the barrel. Circular venting on a sheet metal covering was wrapped around the barrel further ahead of the wooden forend. The barrel was capped by a six-baffled muzzle brake and a forward sight post was visible for accurized fire. The receiver held all the major working internal components, which were essentially the same as in the SVT-38 series. The curved trigger sat within an oblong trigger guard and the 10-round detachable magazine was fitted just ahead. Spent cartridges were ejected from the right side of the body. A flip-up rear sight was set ahead of the magazine feed along the top of the receiver. The cleaning rod was now relocated to a more traditional placement underneath the barrel.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "920175a3-eced-4bbf-a4bf-1b8635d28d37", "year_model": "1939", "weapon_name": "Molotov Cocktail", "weapon_type": "Fire Bomb", "description": "Various - Local"}, {"id": "ba74aff8-870a-4727-8d8b-9cec45bb87f2", "year_model": "1938", "weapon_name": "DShK Model 1938", "weapon_type": "Heavy Machine Gun (HMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet DShK Model 1938 heavy machine gun was developed to a Red Army requirement prior to World War 2 (1939-1945) to replace the aged Maxim Model 1910 (Soviet designation of (\"PM M1910\"). The newer mark proved to be the same class of weapon as the well-accepted and respected Browning M2 and equally as popular the world over. The Model 1938 served throughout World War 2 with Red Army forces and into the Cold War in a more refined, modernized form. The sheer production numbers have given the DShK series such a reach that the weapon still enjoys widespread use even today (2013).\n\r\nThe Soviet military understood the value of quality heavy machine guns in its arsenal even prior to World War 1 when the Maxim Model 1910 (Soviet designation of \"PM M1910\") was in use. These weapons were entire systems consisting of the gun with integrated cooling jacket over the barrel, a heavy duty receiver design, basic spade grips, a wheeled carriage and included armored shield for the gunnery crew. The 140lb weapon was chambered for the 7.62x54mmR cartridge and managed a rate-of-fire of 600 rounds per minute through a short-recoil, toggle-locked internal action. The type was produced from 1910 to 1939 and became a stable of Imperial Russian / Soviet military use in that span while also seeing use with the forces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, China, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Iran, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, South Korea, the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) and North Vietnam in time. Production was restarted after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and spanned from then until the end of the war in 1945.\n\r\nAs steady as M1910s were, they proved exceedingly limited for a Soviet military looking to streamline its mobility for a future war with one of its many neighbors. As such, a new design was sought though one with the same in-the-field robustness as the Maxim design. Origins of the DShK series lay in an early initiative that brought together the work of Vasil Degtyaryov and Georgi Shpagin, the new weapon incorporating the gas operation and locking facility developed by the former with the feed mechanism developed by the latter. The design grew into a lengthy (though lighter) weapon chambered for the large 12.7x107mm Soviet heavy machine gun cartridge operating through a rotating cylinder feed system. The rotating system stripped a cartridge from the incoming belt magazine and delivered the cartridge to the chamber ahead of the bolt. The weapon sported a rectangular receiver with dual spade grips for a firm two-hand hold. Sighting was through a basic iron arrangement affixed over the receiver and barrel. The long-running barrel was partially shrouded by a section of cooling fins giving the weapon a throwback look to machine gun designs emerging in the 1920s and early 1930s. The muzzle was capped by a noticeably large brake while the gas cylinder - which was used in the action - was fitted under the barrel. The weapon was issued atop a rather clumsy and heavy steel-framed, two-wheeled carriage with tow arm - the same cumbersome unit of the preceding M1910 mark which, once again, limited the weapon's tactical flexibility. After passing the requisite state trials prior to acceptance, the weapon was adopted and formally recognized in inventory as the \"Degtyereva-Shpagina Krupnokaliberny 1938\" - or \"DShK Model of 1938\" or \"M1938\" for short. The DShK series gun weighed in at 75lb compared to the 140lb unit of the PM M1910.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "c025be0e-62e1-48b7-aa62-71495ae7702c", "year_model": "1915", "weapon_name": "Fedorov Avtomat M1916", "weapon_type": "Automatic Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile bolt-action rifles were the call of the day at the turn of the century and leading into World War 1 (1914-1918), Vladimir Fyodorov (Fedorov) was one of many gunsmiths that look to developing a select-fire weapon set within a portable rifle-style body. An early Fedorov-designed semi-automatic form was briefly tested by the Russian Army and purchased in limited quantities while a follow-up automatic design required the all-new 6.5mm Fedorov cartridge which precluded its adoption and subsequent quantitative purchase by the Russian government (the 7.62x54mmR was the standard accepted Russian cartridge). It was when Fedorov, now stationed in France during 1915, witnessed the practical usefulness of the French \"Chauchat\" light machine gun that a new design idea came to mind.\n\r\nReturning to Russia in early 1916, Fedorov tasked himself with perfecting an automatic rifle based on his earlier semi-automatic design while involving the firepower of a light machine gun though straying from using the larger, more powerful Russian 7.62mm cartridge, a cartridge requiring strong internals to work effectively in an automatic action. While much of the internals of the original design were retained, select fire was added to control the action and a detachable, curved box magazine of 25-rounds was used for the cartridge feed. The weapon took on a single-piece, wooden rifle-style body that incorporated the stock, grip and forend while the metal components making up the receiver proper were seated within the wood frame. A straight vertical grip was part of the forend for a sure forward hold and the trigger unit was underslung in the usual way, the magazine feed fitted just ahead between the trigger and the grip. A section of barrel protruded a distance away from the frame and given a slotted metal support structure to serve as a cooling element for a hot barrel. Iron sights were fitted along the top of the weapon. Overall weight was 4.4 kilograms (unloaded) with an overall length of 1,045mm using a 520mm barrel. The action relied on the short recoil principle delivering a muzzle velocity of 2,150 feet per second.\n\r\nTo minimize development delays and increase the chances of procurement by the Russian Army, the idea of a specific Fedorov cartridge was dropped and the Japanese 6.5x50mmSR (Semi-Rimmed) Arisaka cartridge was selected in its place. This round was a dramatic departure from the proven, standardized Russian 7.62x54mmR (Russian) cartridge, holding less power but dimensionally smaller, allowing a greater ammunition load, and putting less stress on the internal components - particularly during automatic fire. Since the Russian government had already imported many thousands of Arisaka bolt-action rifles and stores of cartridges, supply was not an issue and worked in favor of the Fedorov weapon.\n\r\nThe weapon was given the common name of \"Fedorov Avtomat\" and an initial order of 350 units was slated for use by Russian Army elements for field trials under the designation of M1916. The Kovrov Arms Factory, an Imperial state arsenal, was charged with serial production. However, the order for 25,000 units never fulfilled in whole as the Russian Civil War (1917-1922) disrupted much - it ended Russian involvement in World War 1, limited large-scale procurement of the Fedorov rifle and plunged Russia into civil war (Fedorov Avtomats were used by the Red Army in the subsequent fighting). The country would eventually rise from its ashes to become the feared Soviet Union of World War 2 and Cold War fame. Only a few hundred Fedorov Avtomat rifles were issued to Russian forces and used in an operational nature. For the few that experienced it fully, the rifle proved sound and was praised for its action despite some reliability issues. It was, however, a complex system that required attention and relatively expensive to produce. The Fedorov Avtomat did provided its users with a manageable select-fire assault weapon matched by only a few comparable designs of the period.\n\r\nIn the middle of 1919, production on the Fedorov Avtomat was restarted at the Kovrov plant. However, the Soviet government had moved away from support of foreign cartridge types while technological advances elsewhere began to surpass the World War 1-era design, leading to a cessation of work on the weapon in 1924. By 1925, approximately 3,200 units were placed in storage, the weapons completely retired in 1929 (some testing continued into 1928). The rifle made a brief appearance during World War 2 (1939-1945) when a small arms shortage forced the Soviets - having invaded neighboring Finland to begin the \"Winter War (1939-1940) - to reissue its stock of Fedorov Avtomat rifles. Some may have also been fielded by Soviet forces during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) prior. Very few, if any, are thought to have survived, bringing an end to what many consider as the first \"assault rifle\" in firearms history.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "6c05f7cb-d1f7-457f-9a52-6bc37b6b3257", "year_model": "1915", "weapon_name": "Fusante No.1 (F-1)", "weapon_type": "Infantry Fragmentation Hand Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \tThe F1 served the French Army through World War 1 and World War 2 as a standard anti-personnel fragmentation infantry hand grenade. The type served as the basis for other country's designs including both the United States (Mk 1) and the Soviet Union (F1). The French F1 was initially designed in 1915 with acceptance into French Army service being granted that same year. It served French forces until the fall of France in 1940 to the Germans.\n\r\nThe F1 originally relied on a percussion-based detonation cap system. This eventually gave way to the more conventional time-fused system utilized the world over. Her steel exterior was ribbed to ensure a solid single-hand hold when handling. The system was actuated by removal of the safety device and then thrown towards the enemy. Such a weapon proved useful in the trench warfare networks of World War 1 where dislodging prepared enemies was key to victory. In World War 2, the French Army and her Allies valiantly attempted the defense France and the F1 was fielded alongside the P1 and Citron type hand grenades until the fall of France. After the war in 1945, the F1 was discontinued from French Army use, eventually replaced by more modern types.\n\r\nDuring World War 1, the F1 was selected by the United States Army as the basis for its new Mk 1 fragmentation grenade of 1917. At the time of America's involvement in World War 1, the nation held little in the way of an arms industry and relied largely on existing French systems. The Mk 1 proved a massive failure for the burgeoning American arms industry but paved the way for the fabled Mk 2 series of 1918 thereafter.\n\r\nThe Soviet Union also took to designing their new F1 hand grenade from the French F1, this based off of use of the French F1 during the rise of the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. France delivered F1 grenades in support of \"White Movement\" forces combating the rise of the Bolsheviks to no avail.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "204e54ca-54be-4ac8-995c-e98db8a6d7e4", "year_model": "1915", "weapon_name": "Fusil-Mitrailleur Modele 1915 CSRG (Chauchat)", "weapon_type": "Light Machine Gun (LMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tOne of the most derided guns in military history - the French \"Chauchat\" light machine gun - received its start in the fighting of World War 1. However, there proved two sides to the Chauchat story for the French versions chambered in their original 8mm cartridges were well-regarded, useful battlefield weapons - even the Belgian forms in their 7.65x53mm Argentine Mauser chambering fared fairly well without notable issues. On the other side was the American-modified form - the M1918 - chambered for the more powerful 30-06 cartridge which played extremely poorly with the fragile, lightweight Chauchat design. Indeed, American fighters operating Chauchats in 8mm Lebel caliber found success with this weapon and several became decorated veterans of the war while engaging the enemy with their Chauchat Light Machine Guns.\n\r\nThe Chauchat design stemmed from early-century work by a committee of French personnel that included Colonel Louis Chauchat. The designed direction led to a gun that could be transported by one man into battle, supplied machine-gun-level firepower, and could be mass-produced through limited manufacturing facilities. When France entered World War 1 in August of 1914, it lacked a light machine gun weapon and thusly the Chauchat was taken into production during September as the \"Fusil Mitraileur CSRG Modele 1915\".\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "068482fc-7229-4e98-9104-58a46845ad96", "year_model": "1915", "weapon_name": "Winchester Model 1915", "weapon_type": "Lever-Action Service Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tWhen the Russian Empire mobilized for World War in 1914, it lacked the stocks of service rifles for the millions of men being called up to fight. As such, a government \"purchasing commission\" was sent to the United States in an effort to secure whatever types of rifles were available for the war ahead. Contracts were eventually signed with the likes of Remington (among others) and the storied Winchester concern was approached to produce a modified form of their sporting Model 1895 lever-action rifle - the final lever-action design by famous gunsmith John Browning. Winchester agreed and the new weapon was designated as the \"Model 1915\", becoming one of the few lever-action rifles to see service in World War 1 (1914-1918).\n\r\nThe Model 1895/Model 1915 received its general categorization of \"lever-action\" by the operator having to manage a hinged lever assembly under the receiver that doubled as the trigger guard. There was an oblong loop aft of the trigger loop to which the operated fit the fingers of the firing hand to apply the required downward pressure against the lever. The resulting action was used to clear the firing chamber of any spent shell casing and introduced a fresh cartridge from the integral, 5-round projecting case under the receiver (ahead of the lever). A ground-breaking concept in the 1800s, the lever-action saw far less use in the new century. Repeat fire could be achieved with such a weapon though the gun was still limited to single shots, each subsequent firing requiring manual management of the lever.\n\r\nAs can be expected, Russian specifications required certain modifications to the existing Model 1895 design - chief of these being a re-chambering for the 7.62x54mmR rimmed rifle cartridge. As the Russian Army relied on a standard charger (\"stripper clip\") for its existing line of service rifle, the receiver of the Model 1895 was appropriately fitted with guide ribs for proper loading of such ammunition clips supporting the Russian 7.62mm format (these additions clearly marked as protrusions at the top of the receiver). Additionally, a new section of wood was added over the exposed barrel at the base to provide for a more rigid end-product (and protect the operator from heat generated at the barrel through prolonged firing). Work on the rifles occurred in 1914 and the type was formally adopted by Imperial Russia as the Model 1915 - or M1915. The Army procured some 293,000 to 300,000 examples and the first 10,000 or so were fielded with the rare 8\" \"blade\" bayonet, the remainder seen with the more popular 16\" length \"sword\" variety. Deliveries concluded in 1917 at which point the Russian Empire fell into internal strife and ultimate civil war - bringing about the rise of the Soviet Union that would last throughout World War 2 and the Cold War decades to come.\n\r\nIt is said that enough Model 1915 rifles were in circulation into the 1930s that stocks were sent to Spain to help support of the Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).\n\r\nThe M1915 featured an overall length of 1,160mm (45,65 inches) with a barrel measuring 712mm (28.05 inches) long. The rifle could be fed by the aforementioned chargers or through single cartridge loading which provided some tactical flexibility on the part of the shooter. Muzzle velocity was rated at 2,690 feet per second. A sling was optional though helpful during marches and transport.\n\r\nWhile the Russian Army primarily relied on their tried-and-true Mosin-Nagant 1891 bolt-action rifles during World War 1 (and even throughout World War 2), the M1915 remains a rather forgotten contribution to the Russian effort concerning The Great War.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "114f564b-d367-407b-bdab-6033db29dd7f", "year_model": "1914", "weapon_name": "Lewis Gun", "weapon_type": "Light Machine Gun (LMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tAmerican Isaac Newton Lewis (1858-1931) served in the United States Army and lent his talents to invention when possible. In 1911, he refined an original machine gun design of Samuel Maclean and began active marketing of type which came to be known simply as the \"Lewis Gun\", \"Lewis Automatic Rifle\" or \"Lewis Automatic Machine Gun\". The weapon proved a portable, air-cooled system with multi-role possibilities. Throughout its career, it served as a fixed defensive weapon, an aerial machine gun and as a Light Machine Gun (LMG) at the infantry level. The Lewis Gun went on to serve throughout World War 1 (1914-1918), World War 2 (1939-1945) and was in limited use during the Korean War (1950-1953). Interestingly, the American-originated weapon did not initially interest US authorities when it was first unveiled which forced Lewis to take the development to Europe where he first sold it to the Belgian Army and local production ensued. From there, French and British interest netted Lewis tens of thousands on order and - once America committed to World War 1 - forced the United States to finally invest in the Lewis Gun of which they did. Large-scale manufacture eventually settled to England where it was produced at the Birmingham Small Arms Company, Ltd (BSA) of Birmingham UK. The Lewis Gun became one of many weapons that saw extensive use in both world wars.\n\r\nThe Belgian Army adopted the Lewis Gun in 1913 to which the British Army then followed. In the summer of 1914, World War 1 was sparked with the assassination of the heir-presumtive to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, forcing long-held alliances to come into play with national power committing to war against national power. The German Empire was aligned with Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) through the collective name of the \"Central Powers\". Against them was the \"Triple Entente\" led by Britain, France and Russia. Britain was sworn to Belgium's aid in the event of war which came in July of 1914. The German intent was to conquer Belgium en route to Paris, France.\n\r\nThe initial German thrust was swift and forced Belgian forces into retreat. It was during this fierce fighting that the Lewis Gun was first pressed into actual combat. The British Army claimed use of the weapon during this time as well, though in fewer numbers than their Belgian allies. By the time the war was in full swing, the Lewis Gun was available in substantial numbers and promptly placed into all sorts of battlefield requirements - including their fitting at observer stations (rear gunners) on tandem-seat \"fighting scout\" biplanes as well as large multi-engined, multi-position bombers defensed by an array of machine guns on trainable mounts. The war - expected to be over by Christmas of 1914 - extended into a series of bloody entanglements involving trench warfare that would span four long years of bloodshed. The once-fluid fronts had bogged down into a network of trench passages with \"No Man's Land\" sections established between two competing forces - often competing for nothing more than several hundred yards of desolate landscape.\n\r\nThe machine gun played a significant role in warfare for the first time during World War 1 as it held the ability to single-handedly changed any one engagement in favor of the operator. The machine gun was also joined by the aircraft and \"tank\" (then known as landships) during this time as well. The repeat, voluminous fire capability of the machine gun allowed for swathes of territory to be under the gun's firing arc and range, keeping the enemy at bay. Machine guns could also be \"networked\" through two or three individual emplacements covering the other, ensuring multiple arcs and further endangering any brave souls charged with taking well-defended positions. This, along with artillery fire, attributed to the high casualty counts of the war which was still being fought with rules based in 19th Century warfare.\n\r\nAt its core, the Lewis Machine Gun was a gas-operated system weighing some 28lbs. The type was chambered for a series of cartridges throughout its long service life led by the .303 British cartridge and including the American .30-06 Springfield round and the German 7.92x57mm Mauser round. All versions were fed by a top-mounted \"pan\" magazine and these could number either 47- or 97-rounds in total. Sighting was through a blade and tangent leaf arrangement to allow for some accuracy down range. Rate-of-fire was 500 to 600 rounds per minute and the weapon offered a muzzle velocity of 2,440 feet per second. Effective range was 880 yards with a maximum range of 3,500 yards. The weapon was traditionally given an underslung pistol grip with integrated trigger unit as well as a solid wooden stock. A bipod supported the forward portion of the weapon.\n\r\nOne of the key physical features of the Lewis Gun was its cylindrical forward section which was actually a cooling shroud intended to counter the effects of an overheated barrel. The shroud utilized a \"forced cooling\" principle in which the rear of the shroud lay open and pulled cooler air into and around the barrel and gas cylinder through a finned aluminum radiator structure. The shroud also covered the muzzle, surpassing its length somewhat and it was at this area that the exiting propellant gasses induced flow of the air through the cooling assembly at the rear, running up and along the radiator arrangement and, in theory adding a cooling feature to the barrel. The shroud allowed the weapon to be an \"air-cooled\" machine gun which ran contrary to developments such as the storied Vickers model which required use of a water canister and hose attachment for its cooling. While water cooling proved the more effective method (assuming a steady supply of water), it also required extra equipment and required multiple personnel unlike air-cooled guns.\n\r\nWhen it was realized that the Lewis Gun made for a good aerial weapon, the shroud was removed without any repercussions to the gun. Many Allied aircraft were then fitted with Lewis Guns at the rear cockpit while Vickers machine guns remained the primary forward-mounted, forward-firing weapons. Such Lewis Guns were typically set on trainable ring mountings allowing for expanded firing arcs.\n\r\nLewis marketed his gun to American authorities and, while evaluated by the US Army to some point, the weapon was not adopted as America was not yet pressed with a wartime atmosphere (it entered the war in 1917). By the time of the American commitment, the Lewis system was well-established and proven in combat and - coupled with a shortage of small arms for American forces arriving in Europe - ensured that the United States Army would procure the type in time and in number. At the end of the war, the weapon remained in the US Army inventory though relegated for training purposes - a veteran of one of the first modern bloody conflicts and the first to showcase machine guns in their full, frightful power. American aircraft did, however, standardized on Lewis Guns for a time following the European experience.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "ea6369c7-e0a3-4c4e-96e1-2d54388eae30", "year_model": "1914", "weapon_name": "Marlin Model 1914 (Marlin Gun / M1917)", "weapon_type": "Air-Cooled, Belt-Fed Machine Gun", "description": "\r\n        \tThe original Colt-Browning Model 1898 was developed by famed American gunsmith John Moses Browning and Matthew S. Browning over the period spanning 1889-1895. Affectionately named the \"Potato Digger\", it was one of the earliest forms of automatically-operated machine guns in circulation anywhere in the world and the first to be adopted by the United States military. The gun would go on to see extensive combat actions in many far-reaching and localized conflicts for its time, ranging from the Spanish-American War (1898) and World War 1 (1914-1918) to World War 2 (1939-1945). Some rare examples are still being encountered on the modern battlefield today.\n\r\nThe Model 1895/14 variant (also \"Model 1914\") was a progressive evolution of the line and appeared in 0.30-08 Springfield chambering while being manufactured by the Marlin Arms Corporation (Marlin Rockwell) of New Haven, Connecticut and Colt. Combined with Colt's contribution, some 25,000 units were eventual made and its widespread adoption made it a commercial success for its time. The gun was also given a low-profile tripod for prone firing with aided tactical flexibility lacking in competing, water-cooled designs of the period.\n\r\nThis new incarnation of the gun was available in time for the fighting of World War 1 and taken into service at various levels by the British, Canadian, French, and Russians in local cartridges. For the British this meant the .303 British rifle round and, for the Russian Empire, this was the 7.62x54mmR rifle round. The latter took delivery of some 14,800 total units before the end.\n\r\nInternally, the gun operated from a gas-impingement system under full-automatic fire mode, releasing upwards of 400 rounds-per-minute at the target area. Because of Browning's expertise in manually-operated lever-action guns for the Winchester concern, the same principle was applied to the function of the machine gun to enact an automatic (hands-off), repeating internal function. Furthermore, the gun was air-cooled and made lighter in weight while being less complex, maximizing portability and simplicity when compared to contemporary water-cooled designs of the day. The primary side-effect of all this, however, was the relatively low rate-of-fire of 400 rpm.\n\r\nNevertheless, with the arrival of The Great War in the summer of 1914, greater attention was given to the gun as any and all weapons of war were sought by all sides of the conflict. At this point, Colt rejoined the production effort to meet demand and capitalized on the growing, years-long war ahead - though their involvement would end in  1916 to which point Marlin lines took on the bulk of demand. Canadian forces fielded the machine gun in .303 British and their use lasted until the more effective Vickers Machine Gun could be had in quantity - the remaining ex-Canadian stocks were redistributed to allied Belgian Army units for the remainder of the fighting. As for the American Army, which eventually found its way to European battlefields in 1917-1918, the Marlin Model 1914 was already considered obsolete and more modern forms were actively sought.\n\r\nIn time, the Marlin Model 1895/17 succeeded the Model 1914 design and brought with it such features as a detachable barrel assembly and improved accessibility. Different forms of this version then followed to satisfy vehicle- and aircraft-mounted requirements but the battlefield success of the competing water-cooled Browning M1917 (and subsequent air-cooled M1919) in .30 caliber soon rendered many of the in-service Marlin machine guns second-rate or  obsolete as a frontline solution for the Americans. Despite this, some Marlin guns managed to reappear in service at the time of the Second World War with desperate forces looking to shore up demand for repeat-fire weapon systems.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4328c3a0-7d73-44f0-8e6a-8f448349030a", "year_model": "1914", "weapon_name": "Model 1914 Stick Grenade", "weapon_type": "Concussion / Fragmentation Grenade", "description": "\r\n        \tLike other military powers of the World War 1 period (1914-1918), the Russian Army adopted a \"stick grenade\" design as an anti-infantry measure. In Imperial Russian Army service, this became the \"Model 1914\", a weapon designed by Vladimir Rdultovsky and a modification of the earlier Model 1912 model. The grenade carried either a Picric Acid or TNT filling depending on the production model and was used for decades before a successor was eventually adopted.\n\r\nThe basic function of the Model 1914 relied on a 4- to 5-second timed-fuse delay. The \"stick\" nature of the grenade, popular during the World War 1 period, allowed the base to be held as a handle in one hand and the safety catch to be operated with the other. Once the catch was released, the grenade was active and could be thrown - the safety pin releasing when the grenade went airborne. Overall length of the grenade reached 235mm with a diameter of 45mm while weight was between 500 grams and 780 grams depending on production model.\n\r\nThere were three primary forms of the series: the basic concussion grenade was the Model 1914 and this was followed by the dimensionally larger and slightly heavier Model 1917 which was developed as a chemical weapon (releasing Chloropicrin around the detonation area). The Model 1914/30 was an interwar development essentially taking the Model 1914 design and switching to a TNT filling. The grenade could further be converted to a fragmentation weapon by applying a thin metal sleeve - though at the expense of added weight.\n\r\nThe Model 1914 and its derivatives saw combat service during World War 1 (up until the Russian departure in 1917) and throughout World War 2 (1939-1945), this now under the Soviet flag due to the large stocks that remained in circulation. Captured examples (mainly Model 194/30 versions) by the Germans were redesignated to HG 336(r).\n\r\nThe Model 1914 was succeeded in Red Army service by the RGD-33 (fragmentation stick) and RGD-5 (fragmentation egg) types though it managed to see service into the 1980s in a reduced training role.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "5535c771-158b-4799-823a-1c2e0bf30a46", "year_model": "1910", "weapon_name": "Pulemet Maksima Obrazets Model 1910 (PM Model 1910)", "weapon_type": "Water-Cooled Heavy Machine Gun (HMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tLike other turn-of-the-century world powers, the Russians adopted the famous Maxim Machine Gun - a weapon being the brainchild of American Hiram Maxim and becoming the world's first recoil-operated machine gun system when it was unveiled in 1884. Up to that point, heavy-volume, repeat-fire battlefield weapons required manual actuation such as movement of a hand crank (the Gatling Gun for example) and such weapons were further utilized as artillery pieces rather than tactical-level implements. The Maxim design rewrote the book on automatic fire by its utilization of propellant gasses captured by each spent cartridge and reused in the firing action to set up the subsequent shot. The weapon was such an evolution that it was adopted by the German Empire as the \"Maxim 08\" and taken on in license production by British Vickers as the \"Vickers Machine Gun\" - both classic adaptations of the base design. The Russians followed suit and adopted a slightly modified version of the weapon as the \"Pulemyot Maxima Obraztsa 1910 Goda\" (the \"PM Model 1910\") which, itself, was an improved version of their earlier Model 1905. Despite the list of designations, all Maxim-related guns shared the same form and function on the battlefield.\n\r\nThe lengthy Puleymot Maxima Obraztsa 1910 Goda name translated rather appropriately to \"Maxim's Machine Gun Model of 1910\".\n\r\nThe PM Model 1910 was classified as a \"heavy machine gun\" and required the services of multiple crew as it utilized vast quantities of ammunition, a heavy, solid two-wheeled carriage mount with integral gun shield and tow handle, and water-cooling for the barrel through a canister and hose arrangement. The water-cooling was a necessary function of the gun which led to a large corrugated jacket being set around the barrel assembly. The water would prevent its fracture or deformation through heavy sustained fire - the guns produced a tremendous amount of heat during the firing process, a trait shared by all versions of the Maxim.\n\r\nWhile the weapon was not simple to transport, it could easily turn the tide of any single engagement through its voluminous fire capabilities. The weapon made for a batter defensive-minded system but its carriage also allowed operators to haul the weapon into combat along a fluid front line. Like other machine guns of the period, it was a belt-fed system relying on a short-recoil action with toggle-based locking function. A dedicated member of the crew would be in charge of management of this belt and helping to clear any stoppages in the system. Other crew would keep the ammunition supply stocked and at-the-ready while still others would manage the water supply. Rate-of-fire was 600 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 2,430 feet per second - which gave the PM Model 1910 excellent killing power at range. The complete weapon system weighed 140lbs with an overall length of 42 inches. The cartridge of choice was the Russian 7.62x54mmR rife round - a proven man-stopper originating in 1891.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f2acca1c-ba51-4317-b286-3a74ae09a36d", "year_model": "1907", "weapon_name": "Winchester Model 1907", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic / Full-Automatic Rifle / Carbine", "description": "\r\n        \tFresh from a century that saw the Winchester Repeating Arms Company find success with its lever-action, repeat-fire rifles, the firm unveiled a new line of semi-automatic rifles beginning with the Model 1903. About 126,000 of these were manufactured under several patents, some of which later extended to the upcoming Model 1905, Model 1907, and Model 1910 semi-automatic rifles. All operated from the same semi-automatic function (which required no pumping of a slide or management of a lever) and blowback action (utilizing the energy resultant from the expended cartridge). In the case of the Model 1907 - which saw combat deployment with France during World War 1 (1914-1918) - the weapon was chambered for the rather unique .351 Winchester Self-Loading cartridge. Design of the rifle was attributed to T.C. Johnson, a gunsmith who joined Winchester in 1885.\n\r\nThe Model 1907 took on largely the same form and function of the preceding Winchester semi-automatic rifle designs. It was given the usual Winchester flat, rectangular, and largely featureless metal receiver with a large ejection port seated along the right side of the body. The 5- or 10-round detachable magazine was fed through the bottom just ahead of the trigger loop with the loop underslung in the usual way, protecting a slim trigger spur. The shoulder stock was ergonomically shaped to serve both the shooting hand and supporting shoulder. The barrel was only partially exposed over some of its length with the rest covered over in a wooden forend. Overall weight was around 8lb with an overall length of 40 inches and barrel length of 20 inches.\n\r\nWhen World War came to Europe, all manner of existing weaponry was pressed into service. There proved such shortages of small arms that many of the primary players looked overseas to further bolster limited stocks. Many companies in America jumped at the chance to profit from Europe's new grand war and Winchester managed to sell its Model 1907 in some number to the French Army. The first French batch order obtained during October of 1915 totaled 300 rifles and this was followed by a further 2,200 rifles into 1918 - the last year of the war. French Army models differed from their civilian-minded Winchester offerings in that their internals were now slightly reworked to offer full-automatic fire (up to 700 rounds per minute) - making the Model 1907 something of an early assault rifle/assault carbine design. To offset the high volume of fire, the magazines were lengthened from their original 5-/10-round capacities to 15- and 20-round counts. One of the sticking points of the Model 1907, however, was its use of the unique .351 Winchester cartridge which forced the French to order some 1.5 million cartridges with their new guns. In keeping with small arms long gun design of the period, the Model 1907s were also outfitted with mountings for a field bayonet.\n\r\n Following the French, the Russian Empire also purchased the Winchester rifle but this only totaled about 500 units or so with a supply of ammunition to boot - ordered May of 1916. The British took on only 120 of the rifle and less than 80,000 rounds of ammunition from late 1914 onwards - seeing service with the air corps. American airmen carried the Model 1907 into action though from a limited stock of the gun - though these only saw service with airmen in the American Southwest.\n\r\nProduction of Winchester Model 1907s ranged from 1907 to 1957 and several variants emerged b the end of the production cycle - usually differing in finish and slight details. A specialized police variant emerged in 1935.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "e340b052-52da-4fea-bf8b-4eaeca0d0e23", "year_model": "1905", "weapon_name": "Arisaka Type 38", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Infantry Service Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Arisaka Type 38 (Rifle, Meiji 38th Year) was the standard rifle issued to the Imperial Japanese infantry by the time of the fighting of World War 1 (1914-1918). The rifle had an inherently high accuracy rate and proved very reliable in even the most adverse conditions found on the modern battlefield - particularly in the jungle fighting of Southeast Asia and across the Pacific Theater. Wartime records would go on to show that some 3,400,000 of the guns were ultimately produced and the series saw active service with elements outside of the Empire - including those belonging to Britain, Thailand, the Russian Empire / Soviet Union, and China. The Type 38 was adopted into Imperial Japanese Service in 1905.\n\r\nThe Type 38 rifle was a \"long gun\" and optimized to use the Type 30 infantry bayonet set at the barrel. In all, the rifle measured some 4 feet, 2 inches long and was one of the longest such weapons still in service by the time of the Second World War (1939-1945). The additional 20-inches gained by the installed bayonet gave the Japanese soldier a definitive reach against a target when close-quarters fighting ensued. However, the average Japanese infantryman still only stood at about 5 feet, 3 inches and thus there would be inherent difficulties when handling such a long weapon. The small stature of the average Japanese soldier also required a comparatively small caliber cartridge of less powder charge to help contain recoil when the weapon was fired from the shoulder.\n\r\nThese design problems lead to different versions of the same rifle being produced that included the shortened Type 38 Carbine issued to \"non-combat\" troops. In this form, the overall length was reduced to 966mm. Similarly an airborne / paratrooper model was produced but with a folding buttstock to give an even more compact form. The Rifle Type 97 utilized a telescopic sight and was issued to specialist sniper units for precision ranged fire. The Rifle Type 99 used a 7.7mm cartridge and had a folding monopod for stability when firing at troops (some are thought to even have been used to engage low-flying aircraft). \n\r\nAs all service rifles and bayonets were the property of the Japanese Emperor, each were stamped with the sixteen petal chrysanthemum on the receiver (for the rifle) and on the blade (for the bayonet). This gave the common soldier a cultural connection to the Samurai warrior class that was still of great pride to the Imperial Japanese Army of the day.\n\r\nThe Type 38 was a manually-operated bolt-action rifle, requiring the operator to actuate a bolt handle found on the receiver. The ensuing action ejected a spent cartridge from the chamber and introduced a fresh cartridge in turn. The standard cartridge for the Type 38 became the 6.5mm / 50mm Arisaka round fired from a basic 5-round box magazine. Rate-of-fire was about 30 rounds-a-minute in the hands of a trained shooter. \n\r\nEmpty weight of the weapon became a manageable 8.7lb. Its overall appearance was highly conventional featuring a long running wooden frame banded in two points. The major internal workings were concentrated at the rear of the receiver with the long barrel taking up most of the gun's running length towards the front. Sights were fitted at the front (post) - just aft of the muzzle - and atop of the receiver (flip-up leaf) - ahead of the action. The buttstock was solid wood and contoured to an ergonomic shape to fit tightly in the primary hand of the user. The trigger was suspended under the action and protected by an oblong trigger guard in the usual way.\n\r\nDespite its 1905-1906 adoption, the rifle series continued to pop up in conflicts even past the fighting of World War 2. They were encountered in the Chinese Civil War (1927-1936; 1946-1950), the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949), the Malayan Emergency (1948-1960), the Korean War (1950-1953), the First Indochina War (1946-1954), and the Vietnam War (1955-1975) that followed.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "982b3a21-2cf6-4952-84bc-36ca3e681ffe", "year_model": "1905", "weapon_name": "Ross Rifle", "weapon_type": "Straight-Pull Bolt-Action Service Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tAn indigenous bolt-action service rifle of World War 1 to emerge from Canada - the \"Ross Rifle\" - was actually designed by Scotsman Charles Ross. Ross began furthered his new bolt-action rifle in 1896, a design largely influenced by the straight-pull Austro-Hungarian Mannlicher series of the day, and a patent followed in 1897. Extensive testing was conducted in Britain for possible adoption into its Army from the period of 1900 to 1912 though ultimately rejected. With Ross' influence, the gun went on to see formal adoption by Canadian forces in 1902 through the Royal Northwest Mounted Police. This endeavor was driven by the want to evolve local Canadian military industry apart from the reliance held on British war industry as well as to shore up stocks of useful service rifles required by Canadian troops heading to fight in South Africa. Serial production of the Ross Rifle began in 1903 with issuance following in 1905 through the initial Model 1905 (Ross Rifle Mk I). Production was from the Ross Rifle Company of Quebec.\n\r\nThe Ross Rifle was a conventional long gun firearm piece, its metal working components inlaid into a single piece wooden body. The body constituted the shoulder stock, grip handle, receiver, and forend. A single band joined the wood body to the metal barrel which extended a short distance ahead of the forend. An oblong trigger ring was fitted near the grip handle in the usual way. The bolt-action handle, hung over the right side of the gun, was of a straight-pull design similar to the Mannlicher series of Europe. Iron sights were provided that included a folding leaf arrangement at the midway point of the gun and a front sight just aft of the muzzle. Sling loops at the shoulder stock, pistol grip, and forend cap allowed for a strap to be fitted for traveling. Also under the muzzle was mounting hardware for a bayonet.\n\r\nThe weapon was chambered for the ubiquitous 7.7x56mm rimmed (0.303 British) cartridge of which five were held in an internal, integral box magazine. Cartridges were inserted individually as loose rounds as opposed to stripper clips being used in competing designs seen elsewhere. The manual bolt-action system allowed for single-shot, repeat-fire until all cartridges in the integral magazine were spent. Muzzle velocity was 2,000 feet per second.\n\r\nWhen introduced, local industry showed something of its inexperience by releasing a military-bound rifle that was problematic from the beginning: bolt locking failures held the propensity to launch the bolt assembly rearwards into the firer's cheek causing injury and - in some cases - death. The unique loose cartridge magazine case proved temperamental and extraction of spent cases was sometimes not an expectedly clean function. There were common component breakages which only served to play poorly on the series' reliability image as a whole. Overall construction quality was deemed poor at a time when there were many excellent foreign alternatives available - the British Lee-Enfield, German Mauser, and American Springfield M1903. Nevertheless, the Ross Rifle was taken on as the standard Canadian service rifle for the near future.\n\r\nSuch failings, however, eventually forced an excessively long line of Ross Rifle marks to emerge throughout its service life. As sporting rifles, they excelled while, as military rifles, they were a cursed design. Crippled with shortcomings, the Ross Rifle eventually made it to the obscene Ross Rifle Mk II***** designation - each asterisk marking a new (official) rifle form. To hide this fact, the designations were rewritten in short order.\n\r\nOriginal production guns became the \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 1\" which used the Harris-patented platform magazine system for containing the five loose cartridges. The flip-up rear sight was constantly addressed even within this early mark itself. A carbine form was made as the \"Carbine, Ross, Mark 1\" and this lacked the bayonet mounting feature of the long-form gun while also including a full-length forestock that ran up to the muzzle.\n\r\nThe \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2\" followed next and this was a mark brought about out of sheer necessity to help improve the Mark 1 rifle line as a whole. The bolt system was revised and the firing chamber was modified for better acceptance of the 0.303 British cartridge. The altered \"Rifle, Short, Ross, Mark 1\" designation was used from April 1912 onwards to help cover the number of iterations seen in the gun series to date - the nomenclature identifying the \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2\" guns. A change in sighting hardware and serial production practices revealed the \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2*\" designation (note asterisk).  Then followed the \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2**\" with Sutherland rear sight. The \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2***\" and \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2 ****\" included subtle changes to continually attempt to improve the type as well as use of a 28\" barrel. The Mark 2 line finally culminated in the aforementioned \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2*****\" which included an embarrassing amount of asterisks showcasing the official number of iterations the rifle had witnessed to date. To help hide this fact, the designation \"Rifle, Short, Ross, Mark 2\" was adopted in 1912 instead. To add to the confusion, the \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2\" designation was reused to cover the earlier \"Rifle, Ross, Mark 2**\" iteration.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "aa671f0e-4ac1-40f9-9074-b27505a4e141", "year_model": "1905", "weapon_name": "Schwarzlose MG", "weapon_type": "Water-Cooled, Belt-Fed Machine Gun", "description": "\r\n        \tPrussian-German gunsmith Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose developed a line of machine guns that became the standardized water-cooled medium machine gun of the Austro-Hungarian Army heading into World War 1 (1914-1918). These developments were also taken on by many European nations, from Albania and Austria to Sweden and Yugoslavia. Operational service saw the line in action from its adoption in 1905 to the end of World War 2 in 1945, such was its reach on the battlefields of the 20th Century.\n\r\nThe Schwarzlose machine gun adopted the appearance long-established by the Maxim design complete with its rectangular receiver, jacketed barrel section, and conical flash suppressor. It was a belt-fed weapon typically feeding from a 250-round ammunition stock and chambered for the 8x50mmR Mannlicher Austro-Hungarian rifle cartridge. Export orders also led to more localized cartridge calibers then being adopted. The action and weight of the weapon required use of a heavy-duty tripod which made the complete system weigh 42 kilograms. Overall length was 945mm with a barrel measuring 530mm. As a water-cooled weapon, the design featured a \"jacket\" filled with water, this reservoir needing to be resupplied as the gun boiled the water off, in turn cooling the barrel and keeping it from overheating. With all of this in play - including ammunition handling and feeding - a typical machine gun team numbered a handful of people for proper operation in-the-field. One unique design element of the Schwarzlose approach was its use of an unlocked-breech design which, in turn, required the facilities of a shorter barrel assembly than seen in its contemporaries. The shorter barrel helped to quickly alleviate breech pressures but led to limited effective engagement ranges and a lowered muzzle velocity for the outgoing bullet.\n\r\nOriginal production guns were forged during in 1905 as the Model 1905 and these were steadily improved through a line of similar weapons which including the upcoming Model 07 of 1907. In fact, one of the more popular breeds was the M07/12 of 1912. As proved common with other self-loading gun developments of the period, the earlier M05 and M07 production models featured an included oil pump function which was used to lubricate incoming cartridges to primarily ensure a smooth extraction of the spent case from the chamber after a shot was fire. This feature was only supported up until 1912 to which a newer, heavier bolt design was added in place of the reservoir and intended to apply additional pressure on the incoming cartridges.\n\r\nIn practice, the Schwarzlose was a well-liked weapon for its sheer simplicity of design and function. It was heavy as other machine guns of the period were and also as clunky due to all of the components actually making up the completed weapon system. The water-cooling feature was a key limitation of many types of the war including the famous Browning, Maxim and Vickers models. The limited range and lower muzzle velocity certainly hurt the weapon's battlefield reach but a machine gun was a machine gun in times of war - capable of mowing down inbound enemy infantry in short order as any other machine gun of the war. The inherent simplicity in design also meant that Austro-Hungarian factories could output the weapon in the necessary quantities for wartime service.\n\r\nA lighter-weight version appeared for use on aircraft but this did not become an outright success - certainly not on par with competing types in the same role. The weapon was also trialed on trainable mountings in rear cockpit positions with similar limited results. Still other versions saw the weapon set atop a special turn-table mount to allow for its use as an air-defense weapon with a near-vertical elevation reach.\n\r\nActive sales of Schwarzlose machine guns ended with the close of World War in 1918 and the eventual military drawdown following. Regardless, its sales and export prior to the end of the conflict ensured it a healthily long service life that saw it still in use with several armies of World War 2 (1939-1945) including both Italy and Hungary - though this was for lack of a better replacement or failure to modernize in time.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "59e36d36-5da3-440a-aaeb-ac48a7af9f86", "year_model": "1903", "weapon_name": "Browning Model 1903 / FN M1903", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Fabrique Nationale FN Model 1903 was a solid, well-traveled pistol used in both World Wars.

The handgun was yet another in the long line of weapons designed by American gunsmith John Browning with production occurring under the Belgium Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre branding.\n\r\nDesign of the Model 1903 (also known as the Browning No. 2) began in 1902 and entry into service was 1903, hence the designation. The Model 1903 was designed as a self-loading, semi-automatic pistol with a blowback operating action and firing the 9x20mm SR Browning Long cartridge from a box magazine fitted into the pistol grip. The 9x20mm SR Browning Long was longer than the typical 9mm Parabellum popular throughout and only a smidgeon weaker. The reloading action was noted for its quickness and the gun itself was of generally light weight. Externally, the Model 1903 was a smooth design and was typical John Browning. In practice, the Model 1903 unsurprisingly proved an accurate, reliable and robust weapon worthy of the Browning name.\n\r\nThe Model 1903 was manufactured under license as the Pistol m/1907 by Husqvarna Vapenfabrik. Interestingly, the Model 1903 (among other Browning designs) was heavily copied throughout Spain without license for nearly 30 years.\n\r\nMany Model 1903s are still in circulation even today, a testament to its sound design and construction.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "96a18d4c-ecc9-4e4e-ae38-cb7724edfa9b", "year_model": "1902", "weapon_name": "Madsen Machine Gun", "weapon_type": "Light Infantry Support Weapon / Light Machine Gun (LMG)", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 20th Century is littered with articles covering a plethora of machine gun designs emerging during the pre-World War 1 and wartime period and eventually leave out - or forget - contributions from offerings such as the Danish-originated Madsen Machine Gun, a light machine gun weapon seeing considerable exposure in both World Wars. Design of the Madsen was patented in 1901 by Lieutenant Jens Schouboe who ascended to the position of manager at Dansk Riffel Syndikat (DRS). Design attribution belongs to both Schouboe and Julius A. Rasmussen.\n\r\nThis machine gun was finished with one of the more complex internal operating cycles of machine guns of the day - of \"mixed\" recoil operation involving a hinged bolt. The method was a version of the Peabody Martini breechblock used in a lever-action design and, as such, becoming both short and long in the recoil movement. The initial part of the action (after firing a cartridge), moved the barrel, barrel extension, and bolt rearwards. A separate rammer and extractor was used to move cartridges in and out of the action.  A series of cams and lugs controlled the movement of the breechblock in the arrangement. Despite this seemingly complex internal system, and the cost-per-unit, the machine gun found many takers the world over - some 34 countries in all utilized some version of the gun in time.\n\r\nIn its original form, the Madsen Machine Gun fired black powder cartridges but these were found to jam the action consistently which resulted in a switch to the more reliable 6.5mm smokeless powder cartridge. The overall profile of the weapon was rather traditional with a boxy receiver unit, extended perforated barrel, and wooden shoulder stock. The weapon fed from a curved, top-loaded detachable box magazine which contained 25, 30, or 40 rounds depending in magazine length. Sighting was through a rear V-notch and front post iron configuration. A hinged, folding bipod was affixed under the barrel just aft of the muzzle and a carrying handle facilitated transport. The trigger unit was slung under the receiver, towards the rear, and protected by a thin, flat ring. The folding / collapsible cocking handle was set to the left side of the receiver.\n\r\nThe weapon weighed 20lb and had a length of45 inches with a barrel measuring 23 inches long.\n\r\nDepending on gun model and global operator, the Madsen Machine Gun was eventually chambered for a slew of cartridges throughout its career: 6.5x55mm, 6.5x53mmR, 6.5x52mm Carcano, 7.92x57mm Mauser, 7.65x53mm Argentine, 7.62x54mmR, 8x50R Lebel, 8x50mmR Mannlicher, 8.58mmR Danish Krag, Patrone 88, .303 British, and - finally - 7.62x51mm NATO.

The series was inspired by European developments and fed from a tube magazine while the action of the bolt was manual. From this experience lay the ground work for a more modern rifle to follow - the Arisaka Type 30, the first rifle to bear the Arisaka name.\n\r\nBefore the end of the 1800s, the Imperial Japanese Army was already on the lookout for a successor to the Murata series and began development on such a weapon in December of 1895. Colonel Arisaka Nariakira headed its design (prototypes recognized as the \"Type 29\") and the construction of the gun had through the Koishikawa Arsenal of Tokyo. In its original form, the rifle would be chambered for the 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridge. The action remained a manual bolt and feeding would be through a 5-round internal magazine. Weight became 8.7lb and overall length was 50\" with a barrel assembly measuring 31.4\"\".\n\r\nOutwardly, the rifle took on the form of those rifles of the period - a long-running wooden stock formed the major section (and weight) of the long gun and the metal components were inlaid. The pistol grip was integrated as part of the stock and receiver. Banding was present along the barrel and forend to provide rigidity. Sighting devices allowed for ranging targets up to 1,500 meters. Muzzle velocity was rated at 2,510 feet-per-second. The bayonet Type 30 could be affixed under the barrel to provide a longer-range stabbing weapon than simply a combat knife.\n\r\nAfter some refinements to the Type 29, the rifle was adopted into service with the Imperial Japanese Army as its standard long gun as the \"Type 30\" (to mark the 30th year of the Meiji period, a common practice of Japanese weapons of the imperial period). Service entry was actually 1899.\n\r\nThe Type 30 was pressed into action as soon as the Boxer Rebellion of 1899-1901 and, a little late, in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 - the latter ending as a Japanese victory to the surprise of many. A shortened carbine model was also made to better maneuverability of the weapon in confined spaces or from horseback. Some 554,000 of the rifle design were produced in all and 45,000 carbines further strengthened this number.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "d4aa8a57-ed45-42c3-af83-d53efd9a936c", "year_model": "1896", "weapon_name": "Mauser C96", "weapon_type": "Semi-Automatic Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tOne of the most recognizable early-form semi-automatic pistols became the Mauser C96 series. The C96 shape was classic with its front-loading magazine, thin barrel assembly and \"broomhandle\" pistol grip. C96 pistols proved exceedingly popular over time, pressed in numbers required of two World Wars and many lesser conflicts, becoming the sidearm of guerilla fighters, frontline military personnel and casual civilian shooters. The C96 and all her variants enjoyed a long, healthy production life and an even longer service life while her success drove several foreign sources to copy the design outright. Several of her marks have since become sought-after collector's items.\n\r\nThe Mauserwerke C96 series semi-automatic pistol was the collective product design of three brothers  whose last name was known as Federle while under the employ of Mauser during 1894. The design was then patented under the Mauserwerke brand label the following year. The initial model was designed to chamber the 7.65mm Borchardt cartridge firing through a semi-automatic internal action and fed from a 10-round internal magazine. The weapon underwent testing into 1896 to which serial production was then made official. The pistol, therefore, garnered the official designation of \"C96\" to coincide with the initial year of production.\n\r\nEarly manufacture proved slow, limited to just over 100 examples over a nine-month span. By the end of the year, the design was further finalized around a slightly revised proprietary 7mm cartridge - the 7.63x25mm Mauser. Firing of the original Borchardt cartridge through the new Mauser design found the action too violent, unseating 7.65mm cartridges whilst they still resided in the magazine while bullets were known to come off of their casings altogether. The Mauser cartridge was more or less based on the same Borchardt design though with an increased propellant charge and a more secure casing design to hold the bullet in place. This produced a cartridge of extremely high velocity and therefore increased penetration values and acceptable engagement ranges when compared to contemporaries of its time. With the cartridge design secured, production of C96 pistols ramped up, introducing subtle variants in design that went on to include the original 10-shot version, a 6-shot version and a novel yet interesting 20-shot model of which was later dropped from further consideration.\n\r\nIn 1897, Mauser engineers reworked the internals of their new pistol, adding an extra locking lug to the bolt. Additional changes were made to further strengthen the action. Despite its appearance on the military and general markets, the C96 failed to net the required sales of note - particularly those of the Imperial German Army who had gravitated towards large scale use of the 9mm Parabellum pistol cartridge instead. In the end, the pistol found a few notable homes overseas - primarily with Italy (Navy), Russia (Army) and Turkey (Army). The Italian Navy purchased 5,000 units from Mauser in 1899.\n\r\nIn 1902, Mauser reworked the C96 design with a new patented safety mechanism. The mechanism allowed for single-hand cocking, primarily intended for cavalry, by way of a hammer safety - a lever designed to block the hammer from the striker to produce a \"safe\" still-loaded position. The initiative begat the \"Pistol C96 mit Sicherung C02\" designation appearing in 1902. In 1905, Mauser produced a C96 form with a shortened extractor with dimensionally smaller hammer, giving rise to the \"Pistol C96 mit kurzer Anszieher C1905\". In 1912, Mauser reworked the C96 yet again, this time with a newer safety mechanism thusly producing the \"Pistol C96 mit Sicherung neuer Art C1912\".\n\r\nIn June of 1914, Europe went to war when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated during a visit to Sarajevo by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Principe. Austria-Hungary declared war on neighboring Serbia, sending the Russians into mobilization which prompted a declaration of war from Germany in response. When Germany invaded Belgium en route to France, Britain declared war on Germany by way of alliance. German forces managed to reach the Marne River before the once-fluid fronts turned into a bloody stalemate as both sides dug in through a vast network of trenches along opposing sides. The Central Powers were well-represented by the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire placed an order for 1,000 Mauser pistols in 1896.\n\r\nThe wartime economy soon ramped up to include production and procurement of all manner of war-making goods. This included quantitative production of the once-shunned C96 pistols to shore up shortages in German Army small arms. As the 9mm Parabellum cartridge was still the prevalent pistol round in the German Army, authorities ordered the C96 in a new 9mm form in 1915. Evaluations were soon underway and the weapon was cleared to fire the Parabellum type munition. Mauser was charged with an initial block of 150,000 pistols in response. While the pistols remained more or less faithful to the original Mauser design, their internals were of course reworked and outer markings were instituted to clearly showcase the change - (a large \"9\" imprinted along their grip handles). These also produced the \"Red Nine\" Mausers when the engraved number was filled in with red. While the 9mm cartridge varied considerably in general shape from the original 7.63mm, chargers were still able to feed ten rounds. 9mm-chambered C96 pistols saw considerable use throughout World War 1 as some 137,000 Red Nine Mauser examples were procured.\n\r\nFollowing the end of the \"War to End All Wars\", Germany was identified as the major culprit of the conflict and assessed much of the blame. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires were dismantled and essentially no more, leaving Germany to bear the brunt of war reparations and sole punishment. This also extremely limited her future war-making capabilities into the 1920s, particularly under the strict provisions as set forth by the Treaty of Versailles. Production of C96 pistols continued, however, and, in 1921, the \"Bolo Model\" Mauser emerged for sale to Bolshevik Russia (know recognized as the Soviet Union). The weapon was procured in large quantities to the new world power with one of the key differences of this offering being its shorter barrel length of 99mm (from 140mm). This proved just one of the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3e018865-0e7a-4bda-a800-eaa97b1a156a", "year_model": "1895", "weapon_name": "Colt Browning M1895 (Potato Digger)", "weapon_type": "Air-Cooled, Belt-Fed Machine Gun", "description": "\r\n        \tConvinced of the inherent value of machine guns based on experiences in the Spanish American War of 1898 (and not wholly sold on the lumbering Gatling), the United States government moved on acquiring more of the weapons into the existing inventory. After trials, the choice fell to the Maxim water-cooled machine gun in .30 caliber, the first 282 examples purchased directly from Britain with the remaining stock to be strengthened through local production. Despite the selection, the US also, rather informally, took on a John Browning machine gun design that was manufactured and sold under the Colt banner as the Model 1895 (or \"M1895\"). This weapon was also tested in .30 caliber form though existed as a gas-operated, air-cooled design.\n\r\nThe M1895 held origins in an 1889 Browning patent. Browning had partnered with Colt for some of his products that included shotguns and lever-action rifles. The lever action was ingenious for its time, requiring the user to manually-actuate a hinged lever handle to extract a spent cartridge case and introduce a fresh ready-to-fire cartridge into the chamber. Coupled with a tube magazine mounted either under the barrel or within the stock of the weapon, the user benefitted through a repeat-fire action that no other weapon of the period managed. Such actions were at the heart of the successful run of Winchester rifles of the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\r\nBrowning considered this action along with a gas-operated system. Gas pressure generated by ignited cartridges could be pulled from the barrel (behind the exiting bullet) through a small opening leading into a cylinder. This force could provide an \"automatic\" mechanical action which drove a lever-action type arm. The arm was situated under the barrel and was sent rearwards into the receiver by the collected gas pressure - the resultant action used to open the breech of the gun, extracting the spent shell casing and set a fresh cartridge into the chamber in one fell swoop. The speed of the action was such that a useful, sustained rate-of-fire could be achieved. However, the movement of the arm required some eight inches of clearance at the underside of the weapon, lest the gun dig itself into the dirt. It was this action that gave rise to the weapon's popular nickname of \"Potato Digger\".\n\r\nOverall, the M1895 was a rather conventional-looking weapon for the period with a slab-sided, seemingly featureless, receiver housing the required internal working components, gas cylinder and a large portion of the barrel. The operator managed the weapon through a fixed, ergonomically-shaped pistol handle at the rear of the receiver, the grip within relatively easy reach of the trigger pull unit. Sighting was through integrated iron assemblies for some accurized ranged fire. The weapon was mounted a heavy-duty adjustable tripod due to its operating weight.\n\r\nIn practice, M1895s were noted for their nicely contained recoil and practical rate-of-fire due, the latter listed at 600 rounds per minute. Muzzle velocity equaled 2,800 feet per second and feeding was by way of a 240-round fabric belt. The unique action of the gun promoted reliability in the design as each round was extracted and the next one set in a clear motion. The weapon was first procured by the United States Navy in over 200 examples (as the \"Mark 1\") though in 6mm chambering and it was then exported to interested global parties such as Spain (in 7x57mm caliber) and Italy (in 6.5x52mm caliber). The weapon was also taken on by the United States Marine Corps which pressed them into combat service during the 1898 invasion of Guantanamo Bay. The United States Army followed and fielded their M1895 machine guns in both .30-40 Krag and .30-06 Springfield chamberings though these examples were primarily relegated to training endeavors. Following the 1906 standardization of the .30-06 Springfield cartridge (M1906), the M1895 was itself standardized to accept the new round through a branches-wide conversion program.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "4fba5900-634f-43a3-beb1-06da13959202", "year_model": "1895", "weapon_name": "Nagant Model 1895 (M1895)", "weapon_type": "Seven-Shot Service Revolver", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Nagant Model of 1895 was a seven-shot service revolver developed in Belgium and adopted by the Imperial Russian Army as its standard sidearm. The Brothers Nagant - Leon and Emile - had already lent their name to the famous Mosin-Nagant bolt-action service rifle also adopted by Imperial Russian forces back in 1891. The rifle utilized an integral magazine with repeat-fire capabilities and proved a huge upgrade to the old, single-shot Berdan series used by Russian infantry prior. The rifle utilized the qualities of a competing design by Sergey Mosin as well as features brought forth by the Nagants to produce the rather interesting \"Mosin-Nagant\" name. The Tsarist Army then moved to adopt a standard service revolver to further modernize its infantry forces and this became the Nagant Model of 1895 (or simply the \"M1895\") which went on to serve Russian forces well into the communist Soviet era. The revolver emerged from an 1894 patent granted to Leon Nagant.\n\r\nOutwardly, the M1895 followed long-established design lines of revolvers the world over. There was a solid metal frame containing the internal working components. The revolving cylinder could hold seven ready-to-fire cartridges and sat under a bridge which strengthened the weapon by providing an upper support structure to couple with the support section running under the cylinder. The hammer lay exposed at the rear in the usual way and within easy reach of the thumb. The hammer held a rather long firing pin required of the weapon's rather distinct cartridge and accompanying action. The grip handle was covered over in a checker pattern for a firm hold while a lanyard loop/ring was mounted at the grip base. The trigger was underslung in the usual way and of a noticeably curved design, sitting within an elongated trigger guard. The barrel section just ahead of the cylinder featured an enlarged portion which assisted in the sealing of the cartridge during the firing action. This tapered to a standard section of barrel which was capped by a forward iron sight. The forward sight was paired with a rear notch assembly.\n\r\nOne of the more unique design qualities of the M1895 was its sealing ability intended to extract the maximum amount of energy from the resulting propellant gasses during the firing action. While most service revolvers made due with the gap required of the revolving cylinder against the barrel assembly, the Nagant M1895 was devised a mechanical solution in which the revolving cylinder was moved slightly forward when the weapon was cocked. In this way, a complete seal was attained between the firing chamber and base of the barrel assembly. To this was added a specially-designed cartridge in 7.62x38mmR chambering.\n\r\nAnother unique aspect of the M1895 Nagant revolver was its 7.62x38mmR cartridge which was specially designed for the weapon. In general appearance, the cartridge lacked the usual cone-shaped head of the bullet, the bullet instead seated within the cartridge case itself. This served to further seal the discharged gasses behind the bullet as it made its way down the barrel and out of the muzzle.  In theory, this design approach allowed for a higher muzzle velocity which much of the energy being captured and used. The cartridge was visibly much longer than the comparable .32 Smith & Wesson (Long) and easily recognizable by its crimped head. It came known under several other names during its service life as well - the \"Cartridge, Type R\" and \"7.62mm Nagant\".\n\r\nWith the M1895 cocked, the operator would release the hammer through a standard trigger pull, the firing pin striking the base of the cartridge as normal. The cartridge's case mouth then expanded in its seating as a result and, coupled with the chamber pushed up against the barrel, trapped the resulting gasses. The weapon reported a muzzle velocity of approximately 1,070 feet per second.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "5014ea85-e2b8-46d4-bba6-861202b72805", "year_model": "1891", "weapon_name": "Mosin-Nagant Model 1891", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Service Rifle / Carbine", "description": "\r\n        \tLike all other world powers of the late-1800s, the Russian Empire sought modernization in its military inventory. This proved particularly important after the disastrous results of the Russian campaign against the Ottoman Empire in the 1877-1878 Russo-Ottoman War in which a bulk of the Russian Army was equipped with the obsolete Berdan service rifle of single-shot. The Berdan held origins in an 1868 initiative by American gunsmith Hiram Berdan and went on to be adopted by several powers of the day including the Russian Empire, Korean and Bulgaria. Some 3,000,000 examples were ultimately produced in several notable forms including the full-length infantry service rifle and carbine type for mounted troops.\n\r\nThe key limitation in the Berdan lay in its single-shot pattern which, when pitted against Ottoman forces wielding Winchester repeating rifles, made the Russian soldier immediately outclassed on the modern battlefield. This spurred internal development of an indigenous Russian service rifle to complete with foreign types and involved the Russian Main Artillery Administration as director of the program. Design began in 1882 and initially looked to simply modify the existing stocks of Berdan rifles but to no avail. \n\r\nWhat followed in 1889 were several rifles under consideration including one from Russian artillery Captain Sergei Ivanovich Mosin and another from the Belgian brothers Emile and Leon Nagant (Emile was credited with design of the Nagant M1895 revolver used by Russian Army forces). A third was entered from a Captain Zinoviev. As with most service long guns of the period, all submissions were, in some way, influenced by the famous German Mauser design. Evaluations of the three competing types continued into 1891 with no clear winner.\n\r\nWith that, it was decided to combine the best features of varying rifles of the period to generate an all-new indigenous design. The final result was a serviceable, repeat-fire long gun capable of replacing the outmoded single-shot Berdans and arming Russian Army forces for the next several decades with a weapon on par with competing designs elsewhere. Due to the design work by the Nagant brothers as well as modifications handled by Mosin, this new rifle became known under the hyphenated name of \"Mosin-Nagant\". Since its introduction occurred in 1891, the rifle was assigned the apt designation of \"Model 1891\" or \"M1891\" for short. The M1891 directly replaced the Russian stocks of outdated Berdan rifles in time. In inventory, the rifles were recognized as \"3-Lineyaya Vintovka obr 1891g\" translating to \"3-Line Rifle, Model of 1891\" (\"Line\" represented one-tenth of an inch as a local unit of measurement in use at the time).\n\r\nOutwardly, Mosin-Nagant rifles were highly conventional in their approach and action. The firearm was defined by its smooth single-piece wooden stock in which all of the required metal components were attached to or inlaid. Finder grooves were set along the sides of the body. The receiver held the metal action which consisted of the widely-accepted turn-bolt handle with knobbed end (the bolt said to have been inspired by the French Lebel rifle). To open the bolt, the operator turned the bolt handle upwards then rearwards, exposing the chamber within. Unlike later bolt-action types, the Mosin-Nagant sported a 90-degree bolt handle which protruded away from the gun body as opposed to resting against it. The weapon featured an integral magazine to which prepared five-round clips (\"chargers\") were fed through the open action.  A control latch secured the next cartridge in the line and all lower cartridges apart from the first (primary) cartridge to alleviate the primary's cartridge from the magazine spring's pressure during the bolt management action. Once the bolt was closed, the control latch gave up its control and all pressure fell to the magazine spring for the reloading action. This mechanism proved important in feeding rimmed cartridges in an efficient manner, cutting down on potential stoppages in the action. Sighting devices included a rear graduated assembly at the middle of the gun's length and a forward hooded post. Two barrel bands were present for reinforcement along the wooden stock. The cleaning rod was slipped into a channel under the barrel and the rifle further supported a socket-style bayonet. The Mosin-Nagant made use of the 7.62x54R Russian rifle cartridge which gave good range and penetration. Loops at the buttstock and forend facilitated use of a shoulder strap for marching. A cleaning kit (in satchel form) could then be affixed to the shoulder strap for in-the-field maintenance.\n\r\nInitial Mosin-Nagant production models were the famous \"Model 1891\" with their full 51.25 running lengths making them a handful to wield in combat (though the accepted norm of the day). A short- barreled version - the \"Dragoon Rifle M1891\" - appeared with a 28.8-inch barrel and shortened forend for a more compact form (48.75 inches overall) intended for mounted cavalry troops (though not a \"true\" carbine by official classification for it still remained longer than competing carbines of the day and thusly more cumbersome and heavier). This version remained faithful to the full length rifle in every other way and retained the socket bayonet. The \"Cossack Rifle M1891\" was similar to the Dragoon Rifle M1891 with the exception that it lacked the bayonet. Production of this select type was limited and its use fell to mounted troops.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "5fdeb934-8d2f-4b77-b289-2068186ddefd", "year_model": "1890", "weapon_name": "Berthier Rifle (Series)", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Service Rifle / Carbine", "description": "\r\n        \tThe bolt-action 8mm Model 1886 \"Lebel\" rifle was a French Army standard when introduced and proved a revolutionary offering in firing a smokeless cartridge with small-caliber jacketed bullet from an eight-round tube magazine. However, advancements in technology quickly pushed the Lebel to its limits and it quickly began to feel obsolete in an ocean of all-new, more capable designs being introduced elsewhere. Regardless, nearly 3.5 million of the rifles were produced from 1887 to 1920 with many seeing combat service even into World War 2 (1939-1945).\n\r\nThe design-by-committee approach was never a good option for military weapons and this proved the case with the Lebel. While the new French rifle was getting its bearings within the French Army inventory, French railway engineer Adolphe Berthier of Algeria began private work on an all-new bolt-action service rifle for possible Army consideration. The drive was to counter the recent adoptions of neighboring Germany and Austria-Hungary of new Mauser and Mannlicher (respectively) rifles that quickly outmoded the new French Lebel. This work then begat a product known as the \"Berthier Rifle\" which retained the same 8x50mmR Lebel Mle 86 cartridge through an action more aligned to the Mannlicher rifle line. However, the weapon fired from only a three-round integral magazine unlike the Lebel's 8-round tube. The action was of the typical manually-actuated bolt arrangement requiring operator involvement and a unique \"reverse clip\" approach was used in the Mannlicher-inspired magazine design.\n\r\nAt its core, the Berthier Rifle was constructed with a one-piece wooden stock in the traditional way with all metal parts laid within this frame.  The shoulder stock was integrated as part of the frame as was the grip handle - this of a straight-wrist approach. A single barrel band connected the barrel to the stock. The trigger and its oblong ring were held under the action in a typical format. The knobbed bolt handle sat over the right side of the gun and jutted out at a 90-degree angle. Iron sights were fitted over the middle of the gun's length and at the muzzle. Under the muzzle lay a bayonet mounting feature (not on all variants however).\n\r\nThe rifle was presented to French authorities and trials were ordered to test the validity of the design. However, the Berthier held much against it, the least of these being the now-firmly entrenched Lebel was not going anywhere any time soon. As such, French Army personnel were not convinced that the Berthier offered many more advantages that the Lebel already had. One of the key sticking points against it was its short 3-round magazine which was a drastic reduction from the Lebel's eight-round capacity. It was deemed that infantrymen with more ammunition at-the-ready were much better prepared to engage an equal or lesser foe at range.\n\r\nThe Berthier design held some qualities about it that were eventually revisited. The tube magazine of the Lebel meant that the rifle could never be realistically shortened to fulfill the cavalry carbine or engineer's rifle role as the tube was a fixed and integral component of the gun. The Berthier, however, held no such permanent fixture and could be made into whatever shortened variant was required by the Army. Additionally the tube magazine laid its cartridges in a nose-to-tail arrangement, each cartridge behind the other. A sharp force to the buttstock could easily set off one cartridge leading to the others igniting in turn - a lethality to the unsuspecting infantryman.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "3fe78d8c-19f1-46d8-9b1d-aa375a218cc7", "year_model": "1887", "weapon_name": "Lebel Model 1886", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Service Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Lebel Model 1886 (more formally as the \"Fusil Modele 1886 \") was the standard infantry rifle of the French Army before and throughout World War 1. The weapon lived a production life that was long enough to see action in World War 2. The weapon was designed in 1886 to take advantage of smokeless gunpowder invented in 1884. For a time, the Model 1886 was a revolutionary step forward and gave a distinct advantage to the French infantryman. By the time of World War 1 in 1914 however, rifle technology had advanced past the Model 1886 as compared to her contemporaries on the battlefield. It is estimated that some 2,880,000 total Lebel Model 1886 rifles were produced up until 1929. The Lebel was credited as being the first rifle designed for use with smokeless powder ammunition and the first to make a \"boat-tailed\" ammunition as standard. \n\r\nThe Lebel Model 1886 was a bolt-action rifle firing the 8mm Lebel round. The bolt system itself was a derivative of the one as found on the single-shot Gras 1874 rifle series it replaced. As the operator moved the bolt backwards, a mechanical lift introduced a new cartridge into line with the chamber. The closing of the bolt moved the cartridge into the firing chamber, introducing another cartridge onto the lift mechanism with help from a spring in the magazine tube.  The rifle was now made ready to fire. The bolt head was locked into the receiver itself by two opposed front locking lugs.\n\r\nThe cartridge of choice for the new rifle became the equally-new Lebel 8mm (8x50R Lebel Mle 86), a smokeless powder ammunition utilizing a small caliber jacketed bullet. This first practical use of smokeless powder was made possible thanks to French chemist Paul Marie Eugene Vieille in 1884. The new cartridge was designed by Lieutenant Colonel Nicolas Lebel, a French senior officer then part of the design committee and whom the rifle was eventually named after. The cartridge was known as the \"Balle M\". In 1898, the round-nose Balle M was replaced in use by the \"boat-tailed\" spitzer \"Balle D\" cartridge - this necessitating a revision to the spring-loaded tube magazine as well. Original Lebels were identified by their two-piece stocks and unique receivers. A cruciform-type bayonet of considerable length (20.5 inches) could be affixed to the underside of the muzzle. In all, the Lebel Model 1886 was a long and heavy battlefield rifle while at the same time being noted for her reliability and robustness.\n\r\nThe tube magazine was situated under the barrel and ran forward, fitting up to 8 cartridges loaded as single rounds and charged rearwards via a pressure spring. In addition to the cartridges in the magazine, the receiver could house an additional two cartridges - one in the transporter and another in the firing chamber - essentially allowing the French soldier access to 10 ready-to-fire cartridges in his gun. The weapon weighed in at 9.73lbs when loaded with 8-rounds and 9.21lbs when unloaded. She held an overall length of 4.28 feet but this was substantially increased when fitted with a bayonet. The bayonet was still part of the modern battlefield and many military authorities still sided with the idea of \"the longer the better\" when it came to bayonets, expecting all combat to eventually be decided within close-quarters. The barrel added a length of 2.62 feet to the rifle receiver with integrated stock and featured 4 grooves with a right-to-left twist. Muzzle velocity was listed at up to 2,300 feet per second. Range was reported to be up to 4,500 yards but this was, of course, dependent on operator training and certain conditions. The tough construction of the rifle also made it the perfect launcher for the VB rifle grenade.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "66d7782b-31d8-4015-80fb-777d5640f18c", "year_model": "1869", "weapon_name": "Smith & Wesson Model 3 (Schofield)", "weapon_type": "Six-Shot Revolver", "description": "\r\n        \tSmith & Wesson was established in 1852 by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson to center on the design and production of firearms - their name today commonly associated with revolvers and pistols. In 1869 the S&W \"Model 3\" revolver debuted which utilized a \"top-break\" frame design, a Single-Action firing function, and a cartridge-based bullet. It went on to see widespread use along both civilian and military market lines and was seen from Argentina and Australia to Russia and Japan before it fell out of favor. The weapon eventually emerged in several notable forms and was primarily chambered in .44 caliber and in both American and Russian flavors. A plethora of other chamberings were witnessed over time.\n\r\nThe weapon weighed some three pounds in the hand and featured a standard length of 12\" inches with a 6.5\" long barrel. The Single-Action (SA) operation meant that the pull of the trigger affected the release of the cocked hammer - the hammer being cocked manually with each firing. Muzzle velocity was 800 feet-per-second and feeding by way of a six-round rotating cylinder surrounded by the gun frame. The top-break action design allowed the forward section of the pistol to be turned down along a hinge, providing access to the six chambers for reloading. An integrated ejector system ejected casings from all six chambers at once, speeding reloading of the weapon. Sighting was accomplished through a rear notch/front fixed post combination arrangement.\n\r\nDuring 1870, the United States Army took on the Model 3 revolver in .44 S&W American chambering as a standard-issue sidearm - this marking it as the first cartridge-firing, standard issue revolver for the U.S. military Additional work in 1875 on a .45 caliber model produced the \"Schofield Revolver\" - named after Major George W. Schofield who added his expertise to the design. Two versions of the Schofield - \"First Model Schofield\" and \"Second Model Schofield\" - were eventually realized.\n\r\nIn 1871, approximately 41,000 Model 3's was ordered by the Imperial Russian government in .44 Russian chambering. The Russian order ultimately spanned across three major variants brought on by changes forced on the original. The initial offering was known as the \"1st Model Russian\" with the revised version becoming the \"2nd Model Russian\" mark. Still more changes ultimately led to a \"3rd Russian Model\" being issued. Like other classic revolvers of the period, the Model 3 was illegally copied elsewhere in the world (including Russia itself) to make for a cheaper end-product.\n\r\nFor 1877, the original Model 3 was out of the Smith & Wesson lineup and replaced by the aptly-titled \"New Model 3\" which was designed around the .44 Russian cartridge. Other chamberings eventually appeared to suit market interest. Model 3 guns survived up until about 1915 by which time more modern products had become available - including semi-automatic hand guns which looked to threaten the hold that revolvers held on the personal arms market for some time. Some saw service in World War 1 (1914-1918). By the end of it all, the Model 3 was a company success.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "f2384cde-3961-4468-9600-29691b2aace2", "year_model": "1861", "weapon_name": "Remington Model 1858 Army", "weapon_type": "Six-Shot Percussion Revolver", "description": "\r\n        \tRemington Arms gained considerable popularity during the American Civil War (1861-1865) with their line of rugged and reliable six-shooters.

While known for this engraving, not all Model 1851s were finished in this way - some simply utilizing basic smooth-sided cylinders instead. Despite the engraving's tribute, the revolver was not commonly used by naval forces as the name implies and use of the \"navy\" name went on to generically identify most any future revolvers being .36 in caliber - such was the Model 1851 Navy's place in history. \r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "0df2b758-68ba-47ae-8a4d-fc27b35226fa", "year_model": "1850", "weapon_name": "Stocking Model 1850 (Pepperbox)", "weapon_type": "Six-Shot Compact Pistol", "description": "\r\n        \tThe \"pepperbox\" gun was developed as a way to provide a repeat-fire function in a compact form. The gun also came to be known under the names of \"pepper-pot\" and \"pepperbox\", all related to the distinct shape of a kitchen pepper grinder dating back to the age of matchlock firearms. Pepperbox guns achieved a certainly level of fame during the period preceding the American Civil War (1861-1865) when their rise was noted as early as 1830. Such guns were essentially offshoots of traditional revolvers though, instead of a rotating cylinder containing the shot chambers, the barrels themselves were rotated to meet the action. Because of their popularity and ease of use/manufacture, many firearms producers all over the world took to designing and selling their own style of Pepperbox. Their design was no doubt helped by the arrival of the Industrial Age and the development of the percussion cap system of operation.\n\r\nStocking & Company was an American firm based in Worcester, Massachusetts and they, too, delved into the Pepperbox industry. A single-action form was made in which six barrels were rotated along a central point, each barrel aligning to meet the action. A trigger pull actuated the barrel's rotation through mechanical means while also enacting a spring-loaded hammer set over the mass of the pistol. Percussion caps were used at the end of each barrel assembly, these sat upon individual nipples, with the hammer falling on these caps in succession as the trigger was repeatedly pulled. The barrels were machined out of a single piece of metal for the required tolerances and the trigger unit sat under the body of the gun in a traditional fashion, protected some by a thin oblong ring. The handle was a curved section finely contoured with the weapon's profile and covered in wooden grips. An offered caliber was 32 and the barrels measured 4 inches long.\n\r\nPepperboxes like that offered by Stocking were intended from the outset to serve the civilian market as a self-defense measure. However, their usefulness went beyond this and many types were purchased by officers of military forces when possible - most often through private dealings as these weapons were not standard-issue guns. Pepperboxes continued in popularity through to the end of the 19th Century by which point the revolver was firmly entrenched as a trusty sidearm and the semi-automatic pistol was beginning to take form.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "04005a16-076a-45f0-a874-cec9b5cee767", "year_model": "1848", "weapon_name": "Dreyse Model 1841 (Needle Gun)", "weapon_type": "Bolt-Action Service Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tIn 1841, the Prussian Army (Prussia, 1525 - 1947) adopted a new long gun known as the Dreyse \"Needle Gun\".   The weapon was a breech-loading rifle utilizing a manually-actuated bolt lever and firing an acorn-shaped bullet (of lead) contained in a paper cartridge. The \"needle gun\" name stemmed from the firing pin in the action which was used to pierce the cartridges and activate the propellant. As a single-shot weapon, the Needle Gun was reloaded after every firing action by manipulation of the bolt lever.\n\r\nDesign of the rifle is attributed to Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse and work on it began in 1836.\n\r\nDuring the period, many long guns around the world still relied on the tried-and-true flintlock action as well as smoothbore barrels and loading from the muzzle (with gunpowder and bullet). The Needle Gun was a vast departure from this approach as it reworked all of these qualities to produce a very modern firearm. A wooden stock still made up the body of the weapon and banding was present along the length of the forend and barrel for rigidity. The bolt lever was offset to the right side of the action and the trigger was underslung in the usual way. The lever provided the needed access to the breech section of the gun. Iron sights were fitted over the weapon, one ahead of the action and the other near the muzzle.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "a11b3ba7-45b5-4d3f-8a12-ebd17b7fc414", "year_model": "1801", "weapon_name": "Baker Rifle (Baker Infantry Rifle)", "weapon_type": "Muzzle-Loading Service Rifle", "description": "\r\n        \tBritish Army authorities garnered much experience from its battles in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), particularly in the value of rifled long-barrel designs over the British reliance on smoothbore muskets. British \"Brown Bess\" muskets faced off against the famous \"Kentucky Rifles\" of the Americans in the war to which the American guns proved more accurate at range allowing smaller, more independent units to be fielded against the British collections of massed troops due to inherently more inaccurate fire from their guns.\n\r\nHeading into the new century and already engulfed in another period of war with neighboring France as part of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802), work had begun on modernizing the British Army with issuance of a standardized rifle pattern form.  With work brought along primarily by gunmaker Ezekiel Baker, the \"Baker Rifle\" became the first standardized, British-designed and developed rifle to see official service. Adopted and first produced during 1800, the Baker Rifle was in service from 1801 to 1837 before being replaced by more modern types. Some 22,000 of the rifle were produced in that span and the guns coming from no fewer than twenty British assemblers. The design was influenced by close examination of the German \"Jager Rifle\".\n\r\nThe 32-inch barrel form became the \"Infantry Rifle\" of .75 caliber and this was followed by a slightly shortened model with a 30-inch long barrel sized for a .653 shot. The classic Baker Rifle design was sized for a smaller .615 lead ball (.62 caliber). All versions of the gun held the typical wooden body with integral grip and shoulder stock as well as support for a 24-inch under-barrel sword bayonet. Brass was featured at the trigger guard under the action and a brass patchbox was seated at the butt. As a flintlock weapon, the gun relied on a hinged hammer to hold the required piece of flint rock which, when brought down at the frizzen, caused sparks used to actuate the ignition process of the powder in the awaiting chamber. Flintlock remained an accepted firearms action for some 200 years before being replaced by the percussion cap during the latter part of the 1800s. In time, a more compact version of the gun - intended for horse-mounted infantry - was issued as a \"Cavalry Carbine\". Other forms saw a 33-inch barrel manufactured upon request.\n\r\nSeveral patterns of the base design ultimately emerged as the years went along and as practical use of the weapon ensued. A safety catch was eventually requested (and added) as was as a swiveling ramrod to help better attack the rod to the gun underside. Some guns lacked the patchbox in the stock for simplicity and other variants changed the bayonet mounting hardware.\n\r\nBaker Rifles were in play during the Napoleonic Wars which spanned from 1803 to 1815 but their issuance was limited at this time within the British Army ranks - the famous Brown Bess continuing in great numbers in frontline service. What Baker Rifles were used in combat (usually issued to specialized troops) gave good reports of accuracy at range while being able to take general battlefield abuse in stride though their reloading process was considered lengthier than that of competing muskets. Some guns were issued to sharpshooters for the sniper role due to their ranged effectiveness - up to 200 yards - with successful hits having been recorded as far out as 600 yards though this was not commonplace.\n\r\nThe Baker Rifle led a healthy and long service life considering the period of firearms advancement it resided in. Examples were eventually procured by Canada, Mexico, Nepal, and the United States and further combat service beyond the Napoleonic Wars included the British-American War of 1812, the American Indian Wars (ending in 1924), and during the Texas Revolution (1835-1836) which resulted in the U.S. creation of the Republic of Texas from neighboring Mexico. Some Baker Rifles were passed on to coalition allies during the Napoleonic Wars as well.\r\n\t\t"}, {"id": "33dc80e2-17d5-4d9b-96d1-a90d9c789b5b", "year_model": "1720", "weapon_name": "Blunderbuss", "weapon_type": "Short-Barreled, Short-Ranged Musket", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Blunderbuss (born of the Dutch word \"Donderbus\", appropriately meaning \"Thunder Pipe\" or \"Thunder Gun\") came to prominence in the early part of the 18th Century (1701-1800) and was more akin to the modern day shotgun than a \"long gun\" musket or heavy pistol of the time. As such, she excelled in close-in fighting, be it within the confines of naval warfare or walled nature of the urban environment, where her spread of shot could inflict maximum damage to targets at close ranges. Its manageable size, coupled with its spread shot, ensured some level of accuracy for even the novice user and its appearance was rather intimidating to those unfortunate enough to be staring down the business end. As with modern shotgun firearms, the Blunderbuss also made for an excellent security-minded weapon and soon found popularity amongst all matter of operators - military, civilian and, of course, criminal parties - by the middle of the 1700s. Even George Washington championed the Blunderbuss for Continental Army \"Dragoon\" units of the burgeoning American military as opposed to the carbine musket - a \"carbine\" this being nothing more than a full-featured long gun of lesser overall length, proving suitable for horse-mounted handling. In fact, the short-form version of the Blunderbuss came to be known as the \"Dragon\", giving rise to the term \"Dragoon\" for such gun-wielding cavalrymen. Dragoons went on to form specialized units of mounted infantrymen within their respective armies during the end of the 17th Century and into the middle of the 18th Century - in a way, becoming an evolutionary step of the fabled mounted knight of the Middle Ages. Their use of Dragons soon gave way to the widely-accepted carbine musket. The Blunderbuss was also known as the \"Blunderbess\".\n\r\nThe Blunderbuss existed in two distinctly notable forms - a short, pistol-like form (the aforementioned \"Dragon\") and the more identifiable medium-sized, shotgun-like version. Both versions were muzzle-loading firearms - that is, loaded from the barrel end as opposed to an open breech at the rear of the gun body. Blunderbuss operation was actuated by a flintlock arrangement requiring use of a swiveling \"cock\" that held a piece of flint stone. Loading involved filling the barrel with an appropriate level of gunpowder, forcing cotton wadding down the barrel and adding shot (lead balls) before finally stamping the contents down with the supplied ramrod. Shot could be made up of lead balls or any sort of projectile that easily fit the caliber of the barrel. Gunpowder was then supplied to the open pan along the side of the gun body and the weapon was \"cocked\" for firing. With a pull of the trigger, the cock-containing flint was scrapped against a metal fixture to generate sparks, these sparks falling into the pan of gunpowder and igniting the contents within. The force of the internal explosion would send the projectiles out of the flared end of the barrel in a \"spread\" fashion. \n\r\nConstruction of Blunderbusses, of course, varied throughout its decades of use and each were based on regional construction methods, user requirements and field usage. Some were completed with brass barrels while others were finished with steel versions and, still others, particularly navalized versions, were covered over in heavy protective finishes to help combat the corrosive effects of the salty sea against the temperamental wood and metal construction of these guns. \r\n\t\t"}], "vehicles": [{"id": "df03ed2d-5893-4eb9-8c02-12fdfd84c2f6", "year_model": "2022", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Marker is an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) designed, developed, and manufactured by Russian industry.

The MRAP was used to good effect throughout the American and coalition wars in Afghanistan and Iraq where surprise attacks from mines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and guerilla-style assaults proved commonplace. A long-time fixture of South African forces, the MRAP eventually became a mainstay of major fighting forces such as the United States, Great Britain, and Russia.\n\r\nOne of the available Russian forces is the KAMAZ-53949 - also known as the Taifun K-53949 - born of the versatile \"Typhoon\" line of vehicles manufactured en mass by the KamAZ concern of Russia. The general form entered serial production in 2014 and has branched to include various types in 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 wheeled configurations. The K-53949 is a 4x4 wheeled form serving as both an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) of sorts and an armored cargo vehicle.\n\r\nMRAPs get their classification from the ability to sustain extensive damage or showcase enhanced resilience from blasts that would otherwise destroy or debilitate a traditional light-armored wheeled vehicle. A typical design quality of such vehicles is a Vee-shaped undercarriage used to deflect blasts away from the vehicle and its occupants. In addition to this, blast-resistant seats are usually part of the design makeup, increasing the likelihood of passenger survival in active warzones. Other notable qualities include blast/bullet resistant walls and windows, gun ports, and multiple entry-exit hatches/doors.\n\r\nThe K-53949 utilizes a conventional automobile-style layout with the engine at front and crew/passenger cabin middle-aft. Large road tires are featured with a run-flat ability and the vehicle is given high ground clearance. Armor protection is against small arms fire and artillery spray. An amphibious quality is granted by way of a ducted, raised exhaust stack originating from the right side of the engine compartment. The rear of the vehicle can be configured for various battlefield roles including cargo-hauling, Command Post (CP), Anti-Tank Guided-Missile (ATGM) missile carrier, and battlefield ambulance (known as the \"Linza\"). Armament (including Remote Weapon Stations - RWSs) is variable and seated atop the roof of the vehicle for complete 360-degree traversal of the weapon emplacement. Also, any personal weapons carried by the occupants can come into play as needed.\n\r\nInterestingly, there is heavy reliance on Western components in the general makeup of the Russian-borne Taifun. This includes the Cummins 6ISBe 350 series P-6 diesel-fueled engine which powers the 4x4 wheeled arrangement and coupled to an Allison 6-speed automatic transmission system. The engine propels the vehicle to road speeds of 105 kmh out to a range not exceeding 850 kilometers. The hull is developed by Israel-based Plasan Sasa.\n\r\nThe vehicle measures an overall length of 6.4 meters, a beam of 2.5 meters, and a height of 3.3 meters - giving proper clearance for air transportation in the hold of both tactical- and strategic-type airlifters. Two crew are typically featured with seating for an additional eight personnel. Entry-exit is through four automobile-style hinged doors and a rear access point. The vehicle can ford water sources of 1.75 meters deep (some preparation is required) and cross 0.5 meter trenches. Its gradient traverse limited is 60%. The vehicle sits atop a Timoney (of Ireland) hydropneumatic suspension system which aids in cross-country travel.\n\r\nThis Typhoon entry was developed as a private venture in 2010 and unveiled in 2013.

The hull is designed to protect against small arms fire and artillery spray as well as STANAG 4569-level mine blasts. Windows are bullet-resistant against small arms fire as well. The driver sits at front-left and passengers number up to eight combat-ready troops. The front hull sports a powered winch, slim grille slats, and an anti-skid plate.\n\r\nWeight reaches 6,800 kilograms. Dimensions include a running length of 5.1 meters with a width of 2.4 meters and a height to the hull roof line of 2.4 meters. The engine fit, housed in the bow of the frame, outputs 136 total horsepower to all four wheels and is mated to a five-speed transmission system. Maximum road speeds can reach 85 kmh with an operational range out to 1,000 kilometers.\n\r\nAugust 2018 - Russia Airborne troops officially began accepting deliveries of the Toros 4x4 light armored vehicle - continuing the modernization of Russia ground forces under Putin's reign.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Ural Toros", "vehicle_type": "4x4 Wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier"}, {"id": "f31eda09-c6f6-4e38-8466-b4ee9a61acea", "year_model": "2016", "description": "\r\n        \tHistorically, airborne units have been lightly armed infantry elements with little-to-no access to armored vehicles and viable support weapons. Some deficiencies were addressed in the airborne campaigns of World War 2 (1939-1945) and the evolution of the field continued into the Cold War years (1947-1991). The Soviet Union, in particular, placed a tremendous emphasis on delivering to its airborne troopers useful battlefield weapons as showcased by the BMD series of air-droppable vehicles (detailed elsewhere on this site). The line began with the BMD-1 of 1969 and continued with the BMD-2, BMD-3 and the BMD-4 - the latter introduced as recently as 2004. Continued development in such vehicles has also revealed the all-new \"BTR-MD\" tracked vehicle - intended as a successor to the BTR-D airborne amphibious tracked APC of 1974. Development of the BTR-MD began in 2009 and prototypes were available by 2013 for formal testing with Russian airborne units.\n\r\nThe BTR-MD carries the name of \"Rakushka\" which translates to \"shell\". It offers protected combat capabilities in tracked format, able to traverse water sources and survive small caliber damage and \"artillery spray\". Fast-moving, agile and robust, the system is off-road capable and can operate in cold and temperate weather environments with equal success.\n\r\nWhile dimensionally larger than preceding BMD designs, the BTR-MD retains a full air-droppable quality in which the vehicle is dumped out of the rear bay of a passing transport aircraft. The drop of the tank is retarded some by a deployable parachute as well as a fitted underside cushion. In this way, the vehicle can be made ready to run with minutes upon landing , getting to a tactical point in short order.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BTR-MD (Rakushka)", "vehicle_type": "Air-Droppable Amphibious Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV)"}, {"id": "47a48b55-a55e-4504-8d8e-9fd17db79ad9", "year_model": "2016", "description": "\r\n        \tDuring the Cold War decades, the Soviet Army championed use of multi-axle armor wheeled vehicles among its ground force ranks.

The types went on to see considerable procurement and operational service throughout the world. Today (2015), the \"Bumerang\" stands as the next incarnation of the BTR for service in the modern Russian Army and brings with it all of the lessons learned in recent fighting in Chechnya and the Ukraine while also applying knowledge gained in observing coalition actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The vehicle forms a part of the \"new look\" Russian Army with a collection of modern vehicles unveiled in 2015. The Bumerang is set to succeed the BTR-80/BTR-82 and BTR-90 family lines.\n\r\nThe Bumerang was designed around a 2011 Russian Army requirement intending to improve upon the weaknesses inherent in the BTR-80 and BTR-90 designs while playing up to their strengths. Additionally, those vehicles were designed during a time when war in Europe was to provide the most likely battlefield but more recent actions involving Russian forces proved that a new way of thinking was in order - unconventional warfare was here to stay. By late 2011 the program gained support and a design and development phase ensued which begat the new entry - receiving the name of Bumerang (translating simply to \"Boomerang\"). This product, along with others in the Armata family line, were publically debuted during the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Bumerang exhibits the well-accepted design lines witnessed in other modern 8x8 wheeled armored vehicles. Ground clearance is excellent, made possible in part by the eight large, run-flat, height adjustable road wheels - four being fitted to a hull side. The glacis plate is very shallow for basic ballistics protection and the driver's position hatch is set to the upper left side of the plate, the engine being installed at the front-right of the hull. The hull is given a flat roof line and mounts a turret that holds the primary and secondary armament options available to the crew. Roof hatches for crewmembers are situated over the rear section of the hull roof. The passenger cabin is located at the rear of the vehicle for protected entry/exit through a rear square-shaped door.

Externally, the Kurganets-25 is a departure from the general BMP shape, utilizing more of a Western design approach akin to the American Bradley, Italian Dardo, or Swedish CV90. The vehicle forms a part of the Armata \"Universal Combat Platform\" (UCP) developed by Russian military industry to field a variety of vehicles centered around a common chassis (including automotive components). The Kurganets-25 is fitted with the same crewless turret featured in the T-15 Heavy Infantry Fighting Vehicle (HIFV) detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nThe Kurganets-25 IFV was debuted to the public during the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade, joining the new T-14 Main Battle Tank (MBT), the T-15 HIFV, and several other developments intended for the \"new-look\" Russian Army.\n\r\nThe IFV design utilizes the same seven double-tired roadwheel arrangement as the T-14 and T-15 though its drive sprocket is at the front as in the latter. This relocates the track idler to the rear of the vehicle. The engine is in a forward position allowing the rear of the vehicle to serve the turret emplacement and provide space for the protected passenger cabin which seats seven. The standard operating crew is three (driver, commander, and gunner) with the entire team seated in the hull. Primary armament in play through the remotely-controlled turret is a 30mm autocannon with 7.62mm machine gun. The turret also sports 4 x Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) launchers for a ranged anti-tank capability. 500 x 30mm projectiles are carried as are 2,000 x 7.62mm rounds of ammunition. An alternative turret fitting is also recognized with a more modest 7.62mm or 12.7mm machine gun installation (remotely-controlled).\n\r\nA diesel engine powers the drive components of the Kurganets-25 IFV, outputting between 500 and 800 horsepower. This allows for road speeds to reach in the neighborhood of 80 kmh with ranges out to 500 kilometers. The vehicle also holds an amphibious capability, traversing water sources at a serviceable 10 kmh.\n\r\nDimensions include a length of 7.2 meters, a height of 2.5 meters, and a width of 3.2 meters. Overall weight is 25 tons, heavier than the BMP-4 it is replacing.

Design work on the tank has been handled by the Ural Design Bureau of Transport Machine-Building along with Uralvagonzavod with serial manufacture being managed by the latter party. Production began in 2015 with some twenty vehicles having been completed for evaluation and training (ten were featured in the aforementioned parade). The T-14 carries the industrial designation of \"Object 148\".\n\r\nThe 48-ton vehicle continues some Russian/Soviet tank traditions including use of a crew of three, an autoloader for the main gun, and primary armament being a smoothbore 125mm main gun. The T-14 has been developed with extensive modern and advanced systems to make it a featured product of any future Russian armored spearhead. One of the key internal characteristics is the tank's crew all being located in the forward hull - none residing in the turret - meaning that the driver is front-left with the commander at front-right and the gunner at center. The main gun is a remotely-controlled 125mm 2A82-1M smoothbore and features 45 ready-to-fire rounds. In keeping with Soviet Cold War tank tradition, the main gun also features the useful capability of firing Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) - a feature sorely missing from Western counterparts. Secondary armament appears to be of some confusion - sources stating a 7.62mm medium machine gun with supporting 12.7mm Kord heavy machine gun (HMG) for local air defense (a Remote Weapon Station (RWS) is showcased atop the turret roof) or 30mm ranging autocannon with 12.7mm HMG for use against low-flying aerial targets. The finalized weapons set will undoubtedly be revealed over time.\n\r\nExternally, the T-14's design makes extensive use of angled surfaces - particularly at the turret. The hull sports a very shallow, nearly horizontal glacis plate while the upper track sections are covered over in thick side skirt armor. With the crew held in an armored capsule at the front of the hull (separated from the ammunition in the event of a blast)), the central section is reserved for the turret and leaves the rear of the hull to house the diesel engine installation. Running gear includes seven double-tired road wheels to a hull side with the drive sprocket at rear and the track idler at front. Drive power is from a ChTZ 12H360 (A-85-3A) diesel system developing between 1,200 and 1,500 horsepower promoting road speeds in the 50-55 mile per hour range. The engine is mated to an 8-speed automatic electronic transmission system. The hull is also fully suspended for cross-country travel while the main gun is given full stabilization for firing \"on-the-move\".\n\r\nThe T-14 is outfitted with an active-phased array antenna as well as a host of other sensor equipment for presumably excellent situational awareness and crew survivability - alerting members to potential dangers approaching the vehicle. Smoke grenade dischargers conceal  the vehicle's movement during offensive and defensive maneuvers. An NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) suite and night-vision support are also part of the T-14's survivability scheme.\n\r\nThe Russian Army expects to procure some 2,300 of the T-14 tank, replacing a fleet of aging types. The T-15 is to become its accompanying Heavy Infantry Combat Vehicle (HICV) form also based on the Armata family chassis and automotive components (including engine).\n\r\nThe T-14 is expected to formally enter service in 2016. There are plans to feature a completely unmanned version of the tank as well, the crew capsule at front removed - though this development would still be some years away. The T-14 may also be made available for export to Russian allies, presumably with a lower-quality equipment set. Planned variants for the Armata family vehicle line also include a mine laying vehicle, bridge layer, armored transport, rocket projectors, and a flame vehicle.\n\r\nIf the presented capabilities of the T-14 come to pass, it will mark the pinnacle of modern MBT design, leaving the West to force development of a competing system for possible encounters against this new  Russian battlefield solution. The last notable European MBT adoption came with the British Challenger 2 in the late 1990s. The vaunted American M1 Abrams itself is a product of 1970s work though modernized extensively after experience in Iraq. Similarly, the German Leopard 2 is a late 1970s product.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-14 (Armata) (Object 148)", "vehicle_type": "Main Battle Tank (MBT)"}, {"id": "4703f44f-7c7f-414e-97bb-8cc7738f94a3", "year_model": "2016", "description": "\r\n        \tRecent Russian ground forces combat experience had showcased a need for a Heavy Infantry Fighting Vehicle (HIFV) with a good degree of survivability, particularly when accessing highly contested areas in an urban setting.

The vehicle was debuted during the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade which also unveiled the much talked-about T-14 Main Battle Tank (MBT) with its all-new crew-less turret. Both vehicles belong to the new Armata \"Universal Combat Platform\" (UCP) family of armored systems developed to take advantage of a single standard chassis fulfilling a variety of prominent battlefield roles. Within these major designs lies subvariants to further evolve the Armata vehicle line. The T-15 is given the industrial designation of \"Object 149\" and ten examples were showcased in the aforementioned parade.\n\r\nThe T-15 retains the same running gear as the T-14 MBT though, due to the engine's placement further forward in the hull, the drive sprocket has been relocated to the front with the track idler now shifted to the rear. Seven double-tired road wheels are fitted to each hull side. The upper track spans are very well protected in armor plate and the heavy classification of this vehicle means that the system can also see armor blocks added to its base protection scheme. The front of the vehicle has been given particular attention in terms of protecting against incoming projectiles or armor-defeating missiles.\n\r\nThe placement of the engine and operating crew positions allows the rear of the vehicle to house a protected passenger compartment. The driver sits front-left behind a well-sloped glacis plate with additional crewmembers to his right and rear.

The vehicle was developed and is manufactured by JSC 766 UPTK and has been taken into service, in limited numbers, by the ground forces of Russia.\n\r\nThe vehicle showcases a boxy appearance with an angled glacis plate and near-vertical sides. Side skirts protect the upper reaches of the track link sections though the roadwheels remain exposed. The drive sprocket is at the rear with the track idler at front. There are six road wheels to a hull side. Headlamps provide illumination in low-light settings and an optics fit is seen at the glacis plate.

At the front plate is the 30mm 2A72 automatic cannon offering a good counter to light- and moderately-armored vehicles at range while also serving as a very capable area suppression weapon against infantry. To either side of the turret is fitted a pair of 9M120 \"Ataka\" Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) for countering armored threats at range. The 130mm Ataka SACLOS (Semi-Automatic Command-to-Line-of-Sight) missile is a product of the latter-Cold War period and sports a tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) warhead for maximum penetration upon impact.

The vehicle is in active service with Russian armed forces and has seen deployment to the Chechen Republic in mid-2014, Syria in 2016, and - most recently - as part of the peacekeeping-minded Russian contingent in Azerbaijan across war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\r\nThe vehicle is designed to actively participate in mine removal/mine destruction operations in dense urban or lightly-populated remote areas.  The Uran-6 carries on its hull a mine flail under a dozer-like housing at the bow and has access to other implements for the role: a tiller, \"gripper\", crane, and heavy mine-roller. A robotic arm allows for more precise manipulation of items and ground obstacles when needed and this component is supported by a fork-lift and shovel attachment. All of this can be controlled by a single ground operator positioned safely from the work zone at distances up to 1 kilometer away.\n\r\nDimensions of the Uran-6 vehicle include a length of 14.6 feet with a width of 6.56 feet and a height of 4.89 feet.

Beyond this, its compact footprint allows it to be air-transportable via helicopter (Mi-8 or similar) or in the hold of a tactical-level transport.\n\r\nThe vehicle is powered by a diesel-fueled engine developing 240 horsepower and driving the system to road speeds of 5 kmh. Range is equal to five consecutive hours of operation. The track-over-wheel nature of its design ensures some cross-country capability as the vehicle is able to traverse angles of 20-degrees and climb obstacles up to four feet in height.

The result was the Typhoon initiative of 2010 which begat a family of new generation vehicles. A successful evaluation phase of a Typhoon MRAP from KAMAZ eventually led to a procurement contract forthcoming in 2012 and a public debut in 2014.\n\r\nThe KAMAZ Typhoon is protected against small arms fire and directed explosives by way of a sound armor scheme (utilizing a mix of steel and ceramics), bullet-resistant windows, reinforced seating and chassis understructure, and high ground clearance. State-of-the-art systems within allow for increased situational awareness. The 21 ton vehicle features run-flat tires and an adjustable ride height. Suspension is across all wheels for off road comfort. Additional crew and passenger comfort is provided through an integral air filtration unit and HVAC system. A typical operating crew is two with automobile-style doors fitted for easy entry/access of the cab while passenger seating can fit up to sixteen in the rear cabin. Seats are arranged along the cabin walls facing inwards and contain restraints for bumpy travel or in the case the vehicle overturns. For durability and passenger safety, the seats are joined to the hull at their upper section as opposed to their lower region. A ramp at the rear hull wall lowers to provide wider access to the passenger area and roof hatches are also available as is a starboard-side mounted rectangular door. Gun ports along the hull walls allow passengers to engage outside threats with their personal weapons.\n\r\nThe KAMAZ Typhoon sees up to 86% commonality of parts with other vehicles of the family.

Power is from a JAMZ-5367 series turbo-charged, diesel-fueled engine of 450 horsepower output mated to an automatic six-speed transmission system. Operational range reaches 1,120 miles with road speeds maxing at 65 miles per hour.\n\r\nThe standard operating crew is three with additional seating for up to sixteen. The cabin includes a rectangular door at the rear provides quick access to the outside and gun ports allow the occupants to engage with personal weapons as needed. All windows offer bulletproof resistance up to 14.5mm AP rounds or explosive forces from an 8 kilogram source. The high ground clearance of the chassis adds additional protection against land mines under the truck and aids in crossing water sources or uneven terrain. The vehicle roof supports a Remote Weapon System (RWS) for the mounting of a 7.62mm or 14.5mm medium/heavy machine gun.\n\r\nThere are currently (2016) two primary models in the Ural Typhoon line - the Model 63055 which seats fourteen passengers and the Model 63059 which seats the full sixteen.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Ural Typhoon", "vehicle_type": "Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) Vehicle"}, {"id": "94715e6d-9825-4f62-9720-0d81488e7aea", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tAs the battlefield has become more mobile, the Russian Army has modernized and equipped with various wheeled vehicles that includes the 4x4 wheeled \"BPM-97\" (detailed elsewhere on this site) and its lengthened 6x6 wheeled counterpart, the SBA-60K2 \"Bulat\" - both manufactured by KAMAZ in Russia. The SBA-60K2 harkens back to the Soviet Cold War period when the BTR-152, with its long 6x6 wheelbase, permeated the Soviet inventory from the 1950s onward. Some 15,000 of this design were completed before the end of its production run.\n\r\nThe SBA-60K2 \"Bulat\" is an all-modern offering, designed along the lines of an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC). The vehicle weighs in between 16 and 19.5 tons depending on mission load out and armament fit and has a running length of 8 meters with a beam of 2.5 meters and a height of 2.6 meters. Internally, there is an operating crew of two with seating for eight combat-ready troops. If armed, the vehicle carries a 7.62mm or 12.7mm machine gun in a Remote Weapon Station (RWS) over the hull roof. The engine is installed at the bow with the driver at front-left.\n\r\nThe chassis is based in the KAMAZ-5360 6x6 wheeled military truck with an all-new angled armored hull superstructure fitted. The hull features entry/exit points at the sides and rear while firing ports are provided for the passengers. The roof line contains six roof hatches. An air conditioning system is standard.\n\r\nDrive power is from a KamAZ-740.31-240 turbocharged diesel-fueled engine of 240 horsepower coupled to a 6x6 wheeled arrangement. The engine is coupled to a 10-speed manual gearbox. Road speeds can reach up to 90 kmh with an operational range out to 800 kilometers.\n\r\nWhile lightly armored, the SBA-60K2 includes several survival features: bullet-resistant windows, a central tire inflation / regulation system, fire suppression system, optional 360-degree camera, and powered winch. The angled armor plates give basic ballistics protection as well while the hull armor is V-shaped to deflect blasts occurring under the car - enhancing crew and passenger survivability to an extent. Mine-resistant seats are also given to the occupants.\n\r\nDevelopment of the design began in 2010 and series production followed in 2013 and the line takes an active presence in the modern Russian Army. Zaschita assists in the production effort. At least 65 of the vehicles are in service (2020).\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "KAMAZ SBA-60K2 Bulat", "vehicle_type": "6x6 Wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "01379c24-2870-4f93-b038-5b8f2bf092b7", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tThe current frontline Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT) remains the Third Generation T-90 introduced in 1991 (1,670 produced to date). However, Russian engineers are actively at work on an all-new design for the Russian Army recognized as the \"T-99 Universal Combat Platform\" (UCP) and known by the name of \"Armata\" (meaning \"Arma\" or \"weapon\"). As it stands, the program expects to produce a single universal chassis forming the basis of a family of related armored fighting vehicles including an MBT, Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV), Armored Recovery Vehicle (ARV), and similar. The approach is expected to produce a logistically-friendlier approach to next-generation battlefield systems of the Russian Army.\n\r\nThe T-99 Armata project holds some program scope similarities to the now-abandoned T-95 \"Black Eagle\" project cancelled in May of 2010. This 55 ton product featured a crew of three, a smoothbore 152mm main gun and a crew-less turret installation.\n\r\nStill in its early stages as of February 2014, the T-99 is not expected to enter service until 2016 and full strength until 2020. The T-99 initiative is expected to consist of a variety of vehicles built atop a singilar design - the MBT to become the \"T-14\". Other variants include a Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH_ form, the TOS-2 Multiple-Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and the BREM-T \"T-16\" Armored Recovery Vehicle (ARV). Total procurement is said to be in the range of 2,300 tanks to help replace large stocks of outgoing types - some still of Soviet-era origin.\n\r\nPart of the revitalization of Russian armored design is a new approach to the proven 125mm main gun featured on the T-90. The T-14 will make use of an all-new development of equal caliber and retain the smoothbore principle of the former offering while also support the launching of Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) - the latter a popular quality seen in several Russian/Soviet-designed vehicles since the Cold War years. Additional firepower is expected from a 57mm automatic grenade launcher fitted coaxially in the turret as well as a 12.7mm heavy machine gun. The ammunition stores will be kept segregated from the operating crew, increasing survivability considerably.\n\r\nBeyond its new smoothbore main gun, the T-14 will incorporate the new approach to tank design - a crew-less turret. Such a departure from the norm will allow for a much smaller turret footprint - bringing its entire crew to reside within the hull itself - and promote a smaller, lower profile in combat. Current-generation Russian tanks already make use of autoloaders with three-man crews and the T-14 will only relocate the crew and not reduce its total. With the entire crew situated in the hull, communications and situational awareness could increase. Survivability may also improve as more armor can be allocated to the crew compartment and hull. The use of a crew-less turret will also set the stage for future development of a wholly remote-controlled tank not requiring a physical crew within.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-99 Armata (Universal Combat Platform - UCP)", "vehicle_type": "Multirole Tracked Armored Vehicle Concept"}, {"id": "0553c268-4438-482d-8458-ac95f0d7ca83", "year_model": "2011", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the dark days of World War 2, the Russian (then Soviet) Army has placed a premium on wheeled Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRSs). The trend continues today with the 9A52-4 \"Tornado\" 8x8 wheeled rocket projector which was adopted in 2011 as an upgrade replacement for the aged BM-21, BM-27  and BM-30 MLRS lines. The vehicle is manufactured by the Motovilikha Plant of Perm, Russia and some 36 have been procured heading into 2014. It is expected that the new design will outright replace all comparable models within the next decade.\n\r\nThe Tornado is a complete mobile weapons platform consisting of a fully-suspended, heavy-duty mover vehicle (with integrated crew cabin) and a rear-mounted rocket launcher system. The vehicle portion itself is the KamAZ-63501 truck designed specifically for heavy-duty military service while being powered by a single JamAZ-740.50.360 diesel-fueled engine of 360 horsepower output. The 8x8 wheeled nature of the chassis allows the vehicle to traverse cross country when necessary as well as reach its maximum speed of 90 kilometers per hour on paved roads. Operational range of the vehicle is 1,000 kilometers. A typical operating crew is just two personnel (including a driver) thanks to heavy use of automation in the firing sequence. The overall vehicle weight is in the range of 24.5 tons and, dimensionally, features a length of 11.2 meters with a width of 2.5 meters and a height of 3.15 meters.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "9A52-4 Tornado", "vehicle_type": "Wheeled Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)"}, {"id": "0db4f88a-1461-4f0c-b022-884de73d12df", "year_model": "2011", "description": "\r\n        \tRussian Army urban combat experience in the First and Second Chechen Wars resulted in a need for a new type of armored combat vehicle for the support role. The vehicle would be paired with Russian tanks and other frontline fighting vehicles and provide additional offensive capabilities in-the-field all the while retaining the protection and mobility of a tank and Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV). In 2011, the BMPT (recognized as the \"Terminator\") was revealed, the heavily armed and armored tracked system being based on the existing chassis of the classic Soviet-era T-72 Main Battle Tank (MBT). The vehicle is manufactured by Uralvagonzavod.\n\r\nThe BMPT is neither tank nor IFV as it lacks a heavy-caliber turreted main gun to serve as the former and does away with troop-ferrying facilities to serve as the latter. Instead it is a true support vehicle featuring a standard crew of five, weighing in at 53 tons (short), and showcasing a bevy of armament options suitable for engaging both heavy- and light-weight enemy vehicles at range as well as defending allied tanks against enemy infantry attacks. Primary armament are 2 x 30mm 2A42 series autocannons coupled with 4 x 130mm \"Ataka-T\" Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) launchers fitted to the turret - these provide considerable firepower against armored targets at range. Secondary armament comes in the form of 2 x 30mm AG-17D \"Plamya\" 30mm automatic grenade launchers for suppression of enemy infantry and the vehicle also carries 1 x 7.62mm PKTM for extremely local defense. Armor protection is a combination arrangement involving composite, steel, and reactive armor. Dimensions include an overall length of 23.6 feet, a width of 11 feet, and a height of 11.2 feet allowing the vehicle to be transported by railway, heavy duty truck, or certain transport aircraft.\n\r\nAs the vehicle utilizes the existing T-72 running gear, it has six double-tired roadwheels to a hull side with the drive sprocket found at rear and the track idler located at front. The upper track section is well protected through side skirt armor plates. Drive power is from a single Model V-92S2 diesel-fueled engine supplying 1,000 horsepower. Coupled with the torsion bar suspension, this provides the vehicle with a maximum road speed of 37 miles per hour and an operational road range out to 340 miles. Off-road travel is also possible though with reduced performance characteristics. Ground clearance is a useful sixteen inches.\n\r\nThe need for such a heavy-class vehicle originally arose through the Soviet commitment in the Soviet-Afghanistan War where BMP vehicles proved highly susceptible to close-range, guerilla-style ambush attacks. These vehicles also lacked the flexibility and versatility needed in combating a more fluid, though rather primitive, enemy force. Design work on a solution began in the 1980s and several prototype vehicles were reviewed. The need was further pressed home with combat experience in the First Chechen War where fighting in city streets proved the norm. Again, existing BMP type vehicles failed to provide the necessary engagement capabilities and crew protection being sought by commanders in-the-field.\n\r\nThis led to further work on additional prototypes which ultimately begat the Object 199 model. Unveiled in 2000, the vehicle entered serial production in 2002. Very well-armed and armored, the BMPT was, rather interestingly, passed on by the modern Russian Army - authorities citing the Cold War-era T-72 origins as the primary reason. Instead, the vehicle has found its first export operator in Kazakhstan with interest being generated by the governments of Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Peru. The Russian Army will instead move on securing a new generation of armored fighting vehicles most likely tied to the new T-99 \"Armata\" family line which includes the T-14 MBT and the T-15 IFV (both detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nUralvagonzavod has offered a \"Terminator 2\" package to retrofit existing T-72 MBTs for the Heavy Armored Support Vehicle (HASV) role. Despite its Cold War roots, the T-72 maintains healthy active numbers with many operators across the globe - from Algeria and Angola to Vietnam and Yemen.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMPT (Terminator) (Object 199)", "vehicle_type": "Heavy Armored Support Vehicle (HASV)"}, {"id": "27b5b259-a19d-47d3-b1a4-51fb18af333c", "year_model": "2011", "description": "\r\n        \tThe future battlefield looks to be robot-driven and Russian ground forces appear to be moving in that direction quicker than most. The \"Nerehta\" AUGV (Armed, Unmanned Ground Vehicle) is evidence of this - appearing as a remote-operator-driven, track-and-wheel battlefield infantry support vehicle. The type has been featured in Russian war games to date (2018) and adds an interesting element within existing modern Russian infantry doctrine. The vehicle is manufactured by the Degtyarev Plant of Russia and was first demonstrated in 2016. Testing of the product ensued in 2017 by Russian ground forces. It was further demonstrated at Army 2018.\n\r\nThe vehicle is of relatively compact form with an overall length of 2.5 meters, a width of 1.6 meters and a height of 900 meters. Its weight reaches 1,700 kilograms while its payload capacity is set around 700 kilograms. The vehicle sports the general appearance of a small tank, with its track-and-wheel arrangement seen on both sides of a low-profile hull. There are four double-tired road wheels to a hull side with the drive fitted aft and the track idler at front. Two track return rollers are used. Over center of the hull roof is a trainable, traversing weapons mount which sports a single (optional)  12.7mm Kord Heavy Machine Gun (HMG), Kalashnikov 7.62mm Medium Machine Gun (MMG) or 30mm AG-30M Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL). For the transport role, this fitting is removed to make space for externally-mounted cargo. An operator is required for the proper battlefield function of this system and range of the remote-control is approximately 20,000 meters (extendable by way of mast assembly). Drive power is provided for by electric motors.\n\r\nThe Nerehta has been developed to take on a multitude of modern battlefield roles including general reconnaissance, artillery spotting/support, cargo transportation, and basic infantry fire support. its compact size certainly makes a good fit for lighter-armed elements such as airborne troopers and will most likely be a part of Russian Airborne in the near-future. The tank can also serve Army elements in urban fighting rather well. Its effectiveness on the battlefield will only be proven (or disproven) in time.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Nerehta AUGV", "vehicle_type": "Armed Unmanned Ground Vehicle"}, {"id": "6127ebfa-2e2c-45cd-bf3e-26451a1c36b5", "year_model": "2010", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2S35 was a prototype twin-barreled 152mm self-propelled gun platform once under development in Russia. The system utilized the existing chassis and automotive components of the 2S19 \"Msta-S\" self-propelled gun (introduced in 1989 and born of the T-80 MBT) with an all-new turret structure. The key differentiating feature of the 2S35 when compared to other SPGs was to become its \"over-under\" gun arrangement featuring 2x 152mm gun systems. The guns were to be managed by a individual auto-loaders and could reportedly reach a rate-of-fire of 16 rounds-per-minute. A technology demonstrator was unveiled in 2006 but it appears that development of this vehicle was abandoned in 2010.\n\r\nThe selection of a two-gun approach was wholly unique to this vehicle and an interesting design choice when all comparable contemporaries have relied on single main guns for decades since World War 2 (1939-1945). Not only offering a substantially higher rate-of-fire, the dual-gun approach could yield improved first-hit capability (particularly with precision-guided ordnance), longer barrel service life and an inherent backup should one of the guns fail in action. Each gun is given a dedicated autoloader and reduces the operating crew. Conversely, the system was of a more complicated engineering design and thusly more expensive to procure in number. Use of the existing Msta-S chassis alleviated this to some extent logistically. All other self-propelled gun functions remained the same including tracked mobility and a fully-traversing enclosed turret assembly.\n\r\nAs in the Msta-S, the 2S35 would rely on a driver seated in the hull with a track-and-wheel arrangement in play. Power was to have been supplied by a diesel-fueled engine at the rear of the hull. Based on available imagery of what is believed to have been the prototype vehicle, the main guns were capped by perforated muzzle brakes and up to six grenade dischargers were positioned at the front-side turret walls (two banks of three dischargers each). A coaxial machine gun was assumed and support for an anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof was likely. The turret was to feature an operating crew of one (or perhaps two) and it is believed that the hull and turret would have houses up to 70 x 152mm ready-to-fire projectiles with on-call ammunition selection through an integrated Fire Control System (FCS). The vehicle was listed with an estimated road speed of 60kmh with a range out to 500km and a weight in the 50 ton range.\n\r\nThere were reports of the program's cancellation some years ago though this 2S35 project was once confirmed as active in February of 2014 - though this now appears very unlikely as the more conventional (single-barreled) 2S35 Koalitsiya SPG is set to be introduced into the Russian Army between before the end of the 2010s, succeeding the line of 2S19 SPG systems currently (2017) in service.\n\r\nSome sources showcase the presented 152mm guns as 155mm units which is entirely possible for the finished product. The finalized design could have also fielded an entirely new chassis and hull apart from that as used in the Msta-S series.

The West believes these launchers to be in violation of the START Treaty as they perceive the design to be nothing more than an extension of the existing Topol missile series and launchers;  the Russians counter with the Yars being a direct response to the America-made missile shield being deployed to NATO allies across Europe near Russia's borders.\n\r\nThe missile component of Yars incorporates a solid-fueled booster rocket with an operational range out to 7,500 miles, reaching speeds in excess of 15,220 miles per hour.

For its land forces, a host of armored wheeled vehicles have been introduced or are under evaluation. One such example of the former is the BPM-97 (Boyevaya Pogranichnaya Mashina = \"BattleVehicle Border Guard\"), a 4x4 wheeled, armored personnel carrier designed around modern armored vehicle concepts and technologies. Design is attributed to Andrei Nikolaev and manufacture is handled by Kamskiy Avtomobilny Zavod (KAMAZ). Production has been ongoing since 1999 to which some 150 examples have been delivered to Russian Border Guard units. The KAMAZ-43269 \"Dozor\" is an army-minded model and the KAMAZ-43269 \"Vystrel\" (\"Shot\") is available as a newer, upgraded form.\n\r\nTo date (2017), users include Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Syria.\n\r\nIn its design, the 10.5 metric tonne BPM-97 uses a conventional automobile-style layout complete with forward windshield, a 4x4 road wheel arrangement and front-mounted engine. The road wheels are large and rubber-tired, providing excellent ground clearance (400mm), ground displacement and cross-country mobility. Power is from an in-house KAMAZ 740.10-20 V8 diesel engine of 240 horsepower output and the chassis relies on a leaf spring suspension system. Road speeds can reach 90 kmh and operational ranges are out to 1,100 kilometers. Dimensions of the vehicle include a length of 5.3 meters, a width of 1.9 meters and a height of 2.3 (hull roof line). Internally there is space for two operating crew and up to eight passengers. Entry and exit is by way of traditional hinged side doors as well as a rear access point. Hatches are also fitted along the roof. The crew compartment is fully-enclosed and protected (aluminum alloy constructed) while being rated against weapons up to 25mm cannon projectiles.\n\r\nArmament is variable as the vehicle can accept different turret fits. As such, 7.62mm, 12.7mm and 14.5mm machine guns can be fitted. Secondary installations typically involve a 30mm automatic grenade launcher for maximum enemy troop suppression at range. This is in addition to any personal weapons carried by the crew (in the form of standard-issue small arms).\n\r\nThe BPM-97 is a noticeable upgrade for Russian Border Guard units who had outgrown their aging GAZ-66 trucks. Some of the cars are also in service with various special Russian military departments and the line has been furthermore identified in-action during the War in Donbass against Ukraine as well as in the long-running Syrian Civil War, the local government being backed by Russian military might.

On the modern battlefield, the 2S25 could also be viewed as a very well-armed infantry fighting vehicle. All told, the system became a further evolution of the BMD-3 airborne amphibious light tank family (detailed elsewhere on this site) with a more capable main gun intended for the anti-tank role. As the BMD series itself was designed with lightly-armed airborne forces in mind, the 2S25 has since broadened its tactical reach by allowing airborne (and Russian marine) elements a defined tank-killing prowess. The 2S25 was developed specifically for use by the Russian VDV \"air-landing\" forces, these elements featuring a history dating back to the 1930s.\n\r\nAttempting to adequately arm airborne units has long been a standing challenge to modern armies of the world. The tactical value of airborne personnel was put to the test in World War 2 to which all sides saw varying degrees of success and failure in their respective endeavors. The Soviet Army introduced their \"air droppable\" BMD series in 1969 to which the Americans followed suit with their own M551 Sheridan that same year. The BMD showcased its value and, over the decades, has been considerably upgraded with a broader range of weaponry to further its battlefield value and \"reach\". Unlike the M551 Sheridan, which has since been retired, use of the BMD family is going strong through the Russian Army and many global operators.\n\r\nAs an offshoot of the BMD-3 (now seeing upgrade to the modernized BMD-4 standard), the 2S25 retained much of the original vehicle's layout and general overall shape. The hull is suspended by way of an adjustable/variable-height hydropneumatic system atop a tracked wheel system featuring seven small road wheels (as opposed to five) with the drive sprocket at the rear and the track idler at the front. Six track return rollers are situated along the underside of the upper track link regions to help manage its travel from front to rear. The hull itself sports a well-sloped glacis plate for basic point defense protection against incoming fire. The hull sides, roof and rear are all flat in their design. The turret is situated at the center of the hull roof and is provided a full, unobstructed 360-degree traversal as well as inherent elevation angles. The turret is given a well-sloped front facing and sides designed to supply basic ballistics protection. The fighting compartment is situated at the front-center of the hull with the driver segregated from the other two crew with his front hull placement. The other two crew consist of the vehicle commander and the gunner while an autoloader manages the reloading functions of the main gun on-call. Armor construction of the hull is of welded aluminum alloy while the turret is of welded steel. The crew is protected by an integrated NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) system as well as an automatic fire extinguishing service.\n\r\nThe 2S25 is powered by a single 2V-06-2 liquid-cooled diesel engine of 510 horsepower fitted to the rear of the hull. Operational range is listed at 500 kilometers with a top road speed of 70 kilometers per hour. This is decidedly lessened in off-road travel to 45 kilometers per hour. As an amphibious vehicle, the 2S25 can manage 10 kilometers per hour in ideal conditions by way of a pair of waterjets in the lower rear of the hull.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S25 (Sprut-SD)", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Tank Destroyer / Light Tank / Infantry Fighting Vehicle"}, {"id": "42ae2e73-c785-406d-93c0-7d0065f46147", "year_model": "2007", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian originated GAZ-2975 \"Tigr\" (\"Tiger\") is the Russian Army equivalent to the ubiquitous HUMVEE multipurpose 4x4 wheeled vehicle of the American military.

The vehicle shares some broad physical similarities with the American offering and has the same multirole, multipurpose, all-terrain battlefield functionality as its competing design.\n\r\nThe Tigr was first showcased to the public during IDEX 2001.\n\r\nThe vehicle is a 16,000lb machine with an overall length of 19 feet, a width of 7.9 feet and a height to the hull roof of 7.9 feet. The forward windscreen is of a two-section arrangement with the sides of the vehicle featuring thick rectangular vision ports. The hull roof line is flat and can mount the optional gun position as in the HUMVEE. Entry/exit for the occupants is by way of hinged, automobile-style doors. The vehicle is suspended atop a torsion bar suspension system for off-road travel and comfort with its four large road wheels set to the extreme corners of the chassis for strong balance. Armor protection ranges from 5mm to 7mm depending on configuration.\n\r\nPower for the Tigr is served through various American Cummins diesel-fueled offerings in the 6-cylinder mold as well as a YaMZ-534 4-cylinder model. Output ranges from 180- to 215-horsepower depending on installation.

The country has long been a champion of a powerful air defense network and has keep investment in this sector strong resulting in systems such as the effective S-300 and improved 4th Generation S-400 \"Triumf\" mobile Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) series. The S-300 was introduced into the Soviet inventory in 1978 and remains a potent air defense contributor while the S-400 has been brought along as its evolved form since arriving in 2007. Both are long range systems with proven capabilities.\n\r\nThe S-400 system functions under the SA-21 \"Growler\" designation in NATO nomenclature. It is described as being twice as effective as previous SAM units of Russian origin and supports the firing of five different missile types.\n\r\nDesign of the S-400 is by the Almaz / Antei Concern of Air Defense with manufacture handled by the Fakel Machine-Building Design Bureau.  The system encompasses a 6x6 wheeled heavy-duty military truck hauling a twin axle trailer containing the launcher unit. The launcher unit seats four large missiles which elevate to a vertical position when made ready for launch. The vehicle contains the entire crew aboard and serves as part of a Russian division. Work on the S-400 series began in the latter half of the 1990s though development proved slow and fraught with technological issues (understandable for such a complex product). Testing was undertaken before the end of the decade but the original missiles had a poor showing, delaying its service entry until the latter half of the 2000s. It has since become a Russian Army mainstay.\n\r\nThe S-400 is designed to fire off five different classes of missiles covering medium-range, long-range and \"extreme-long-range\". This has led to the development of at least three distinct missile types in the 9M96, 48N6 and 40N6 supporting the S-400 system. The 9M96 holds a range out to 120 kilometers while the 48N6 reaches out to 250km and the 40N6 out to 400km. Missile speeds span Mach 2.3 to Mach 6.2 depending on missile type in play.\n\r\nDue to its wheeled arrangement, the S-400 missiles can be transported along roads easily enough, providing a harder target to track down and destroy (ala the Iraqi SCUD launchers of the Persian Gulf War). It is said to hold lethality against all manner of Western aircraft - from smaller cruise missiles and regular combat aircraft to larger bomber types and reportedly even those aircraft protected by stealth features. Off road travel is possible as well though speeds are decidedly reduced during such actions. Automation has made for quick response times in setting up the S-400.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-21 (Growler) / S-400 Triumf", "vehicle_type": "Mobile Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System"}, {"id": "b52d65e5-cab2-4027-b73f-4865ea5bae34", "year_model": "2006", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9K720 \"Iskander\" was introduced to Russian Ground Forces in 2006 as a successor to the aging line of OTR-21\" Tochka\" mobile (self-propelled) short-ranged ballistic missile systems. The Tochka was a Soviet product of the Cold War years, introduced in 1976, and went on to see considerable service - particularly with Soviet-aligned Middle East customers. The Iskander family improves upon capabilities needed of short-ranged ballistic missiles on the modern battlefield and thus far it has been exported only to Armenia and Nigeria while having seen combat action in the ongoing Syrian Civil War (2011-Present).\n\r\nThe 9K720 Iskander is recognized by NATO forces as the SS-26 \"Stone\".\n\r\nThe weapon system is made up of two critical components: the missile itself and a large 8x8 wheeled transport vehicle. The transport vehicle has four well-spaced axles featuring oversized rubber roadwheels. The driving cab is set at the bow well ahead of the forward-most pair of wheels. The aft section of the truck is used to house the ballistic missile which rests horizontally when at rest and is erected vertically when the missile is readied for firing. A series of support arms are lowered about the chassis of the vehicle to stabilize the launch platform.\n\r\nThe missile is a single-stage, solid-propellant based weapon with an operational range out to ranges between 30 and 300+ miles and speeds hypersonically through the sky nearing Mach 6. The guidance unit is inertial-based, aided by GPS with terminal homing and accuracy is said to be within seven meters of the intended strike zone. The weapon weighs 8,400lb, has a length of 24feet, and a diameter of 3 feet. Its warhead can be variable, supporting the gamut of High-Explosive (HE), thermonuclear, sub-munition, Fuel-Air Explosive (FAE), and Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP) types.\n\r\nVariants include the \"Iskander-M\" which has been taken into service with the Russians and appears tobe the base production model. The \"Iskander-K\" supports the launching of cruise missile-type weapons of the Russian inventory for broader tactical value. The export version of the SS-26 is recognized as \"Iskander-E\" and features reduced complexity to help protect sensitive Russian technology and offers a range out to 280 kilometers.\n\r\nRussian forces maintain a stock of about 136 launchers to date (2018).

Since these battlefield elements were principally charged with jumping out of aircraft, they were severely limited in the equipment and weaponry they could carry into the fray - lacking all manner of armored support and artillery save for a few light mortars. It was not until the 1960s that militaries (principally the Soviets and the Americans) began fleshing out the prospect of landing capable \"air droppable\" tanks to help airborne units manage their footholds before the arrival of the main ground force. For the Americans, this became the M551 Sheridan series while the Soviets unveiled their BMD family (as the BMD-1) with both vehicles going into operational service in 1969.\n\r\nWhile the M551 was more of a classic \"tank\" design, it was specifically fielded as a light reconnaissance assault vehicle, seeing combat service in the Vietnam War, Panama and Operation Desert Storm. The Soviet BMD was more in line with the \"infantry fighting vehicle\" concept and retained key qualities consistent with Red Army doctrine - strong firepower, good cross country performance and inherent amphibious qualities. The BMD-1 was bettered in the upcoming and refined BMD-2 of 1985 which was further evolved into the improved BMD-3 of 1990. In 2005, the BMD-4 was adopted by the Russian Army to fulfill the same long-running role of the BMDs before it - however much thought was given to advancing the breed for the challenges of the modern battlefield. As such, the BMD-4 features much improved armor protection and firepower over that of the preceding BMD-3 series - the BMD-4 essentially being an amalgam of the BMD-3 itself and the successful BMP-3 Armored Personnel Carrier. While the American M551 has since been removed from service with the US Army, the Russians have continued the tradition of the air-droppable tank in its inventory - meaning that the BMD-4 has no true \"equal\" on the world stage.\n\r\nDesign of the BMD-4 follows the tried-and-true nature of the BMD series prior and visually resembles all previous marks to an extent. The hull is compact by design, protected by a sloped glacis plate and flat hull roof and is borrowed from the preceding BMD-3 design. The hull sides are straight faced with the turret centrally located along the hull roof while the various armored surfaces of the vehicle serve well to store the various \"pioneer\" tools required of the crew (shovels and the like). The turret itself sports some basic ballistics protection through angled sides and well defined curves and has a pair of side-by-side hatches for entry/exit. Each side of the vehicle is dominated by the running track linkage system driven by the drive sprocket at the rear and the track idler at the front. There are four small track return rollers under the upper regions of the track while five suspended road wheels provide the needed cross country and road travel support. The vehicle is principally crewed by three personnel made up of the driver, vehicle commander and gunner. Armor protection is rated against small caliber firearms and artillery \"spray\" (shell splinters). The entire crew cabin is also further protected from NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) threats for the nuclear-minded battlefield. A fire suppression system ensures that direct hits to the hull and turret do not endanger the crew by way of exploding munitions. A passenger area allows for a further five combat-ready troops to be carried in relative comfort and under some protection. The engine - a 2V-60-2 series diesel of 450 horsepower - is set in a compartment at the rear of the hull for maximum protection against damage. Overall range of the BMD-4 is 500 kilometers with a top road speed of 62 miles per hour (100 kmh) while overall weight is 13.6 tons.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMD-4 (Boyevaya Mashina Desanta)", "vehicle_type": "Airborne Amphibious Light Tank / Light Infantry Fighting Vehicle (LIFV)"}, {"id": "d83e0122-8242-4c90-9158-1c4d75a2673f", "year_model": "2005", "description": "\r\n        \tLong-time truck-maker Iveco of Italy (founded 1975 in turin) lends its design and manufacturing talents to the production of the multi-faceted \"Light Multirole Vehicle\" - or \"LMV\". The product was designed during the latter hald of the 1990s and entered production in 2001 and remains ongoing today (2017). The vehicle has been adopted by a plethora of operators outside of the Italian armed forces (where it is known as the VTLM \"Lince\") including Albania, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Lebanon, Norway, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia and the United Kingdom. Its global reach showcases the type's inherent versatility and robustness across today's battlefields.\n\r\nThe LMV was originally known to Iveco under the model number of M65E19 WM-4x4. Initial pilot vehicles were readied in 2001 for testing.\n\r\nAt its core, the LMV is a 6.5 ton system with an overall length of 4.7 meters, a width of 2 meters and a height of 1.95 meters. It features a crew of one+four and a \"stretched\" model adds two more passengers. Armor protection for the occupants is up to STANAG 4569 though the armor arrangement is highly modular and suited to the mission role as needed. Power is from an in-house Iveco F1D Common Rail EURO 3 diesel unit of 182 horsepower fitted to the front section of the chassis and coupled to a 6-speed automatic transmission system. This provides road speeds nearing 130 kmh and an operational range out to 500 kilometers. The vehicle sports four large roadwheels (with run-flat capability) suitable for road and cross-country travel and the chassis features an independent, double A-arm suspension package. A high ground clearance allows the vehicle to manage low-lying water sources and other battlefield obstacles.\n\r\nThe LMV makes heavy use of off-the-shelf parts and components to reduce procurement costs and make the product logistically-friendly to any one nation requiring the services of a 4x4 wheeled performer like the LMV.

The line began with the BTR-40 armored truck of the 1950s and advanced into the tracked BTR-50 of 1954 (both detailed elsewhere on this site). In 1959 there debuted the definitive 8x8 wheeled form as the BTR-60 and this was followed by the improved BTR-70 (1972) and BTR-80 (1986) models. In the 1990s, the line was evolved once more, becoming the all-modern BTR-90, still in service with Russian Army (Internal Troops) forces today (2017).\n\r\nThe BTR-90 saw development begin in the early 1990s (about 1994) by the Arzamas Machine Building Plant, otherwise known as \"AMZ\" (part of GAZ). A pilot form became available for testing and evaluation as soon as 1994.\n\r\nRetaining all of the form and function of its predecessors, the BTR-90 adds a few new elements to the mix: it is dimensionally larger than the earlier BTR-80 with greater internal space for crew and passengers and improved survivability and protection. Power is from a turbocharged multi-fuel diesel engine developing 510 horsepower, driving power to all four axles. The driver manages his position at the front of the vehicle in the traditional way while the turret of the BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) is seated directly aft with full 360-degree traversal.

Various improvements to the original platform have been introduced to keep the vehicle a viable battlefield component and make her an essentially new design.\n\r\nThe vehicle maintains the same low-profile and dimensions as the 2S1 including its running gear. There are seven road wheels to a track side with a front-mounted drive sprocket and rear idler. There are no track return rollers present.

This allows the center-rear of the vehicle to seat the traversing powered turret housing the main crew, ammunition stores and main armament. Access hatches along the turret roof line allow entry/exit for the turret crew. The driver is granted a vision block and access hatch at his position as well as a hinged armor panel.

Such is the case with the Russian-originated \"Pantsir-1\", known to NATO as the \"SA-22 Greyhound\", a short- / medium-ranged, 8x8 wheeled, Self-Propelled (SP) Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system. The weapon system has been in active service (albeit in limited numbers) since 2003 and currently serves the Russian Army through over twenty examples as well as the army of Syria (a long-time Soviet customer). Furthermore, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan and the UAE are reported to have Pantsir-1 vehicles on order while Brazil is mentioned as a possible Pantsir-1 candidate in the near future. A naval version of the Pantsir-1 is also planned with the end-goal to equip various Russian naval destroyer warships and similar vessels with the potent defense product.\n\r\nThe Pantsir-1 is the actual surface-to-air component comprised of repeat-fire autocannons, a battery of missile launch tubes and an advanced integrated radar tracking/direction system. This component can, therefore, be affixed upon various chassis types including both wheeled and tracked as well as aforementioned warships. The wheeled version seen is a four-axle, 8x8 truck arrangement which an enclosed driving cab and attached operations cabin for the launch crew. The launcher component sits at the rear of the truck with an unfettered view of the action around the vehicle. The alternative identified form is a tracked offering with the launcher component affixed to the hull of a GM-352 vehicle. Development of the Pantsir-1 system began in 1990 as a replacement for the aging, though effective, \"Tunguska\" series anti-aircraft platforms.\n\r\nWork on a new air defense system culminated in a pilot vehicle (this on a Ural-5325 8x8 truck chassis) being unveiled in 1994. A more finalized version was showcased to potential customers during the 1995 MAKS show. However, lack of government funding slowed and ultimately shelved the project for a time until backers in the UAE provided the necessary capital to see the program through some five years later. The production model was then seen on the chassis of a KAMAZ-6560 8x8 truck and UAE Army versions were built atop the chassis of the MAN SZ 45 8x8 truck - showing the high adaptability of the Pantsir-1 system.\n\r\nThe Pantsir-1 is an all-modern, all-digital air defense weapon system coupling advanced tracking, search and engagement functionality to a hybrid cannon/missile armament to achieve high \"first-kill\" probability at short-to-medium ranges. Fixed upon the chassis of a mover vehicle, the Pantsir-1 becomes a capable mobile air defense platform ready to counter the challenges of the modern battlefield. The primary weapon system is the collection of 12 x 57E6 series radio-guided surface-to-air missiles held in four separate, three-tube launchers. The missile component is tied to 2 x 30mm 2A38M autocannons that fire can variable warhead types to suit the given defensive role. This \"one-two\" punch ensures a high kill probability against all manner of low-flying aircraft including fixed-wing, helicopters and cruise missile types. Fire control is directed by two phased-array, 360-degree coverage radar systems that reach out to detect at 36 kilometers while engagement can occur under 28 kilometers. The total vehicle crew is just three personnel - a driver for the vehicle and two system specialists for the launcher/guns.\n\r\nFirst combat use of the Pantsir-1 was through the Syrian Army when a system tracked and successfully downed an encroaching Turkish McDonnell Douglas RF-4E Phantom II reconnaissance aircraft in June of 2012. Beyond that, the exposure of the Pantsir-1 has been limited to due limited availability. That should drastically change with the number of systems currently on order - which may number as many as 250 units.\n\r\nIraq has received some Pantsir-S1 systems as part of a 48-strong deal with Russia signed in October of 2012.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-22 (Greyhound) / Pantsir-S1", "vehicle_type": "Mobile Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System (SPAAS)"}, {"id": "2c7bf0de-7c9f-46e0-85dd-38484f9730a4", "year_model": "1997", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Otokar Cobra is an armored car developed for the Turkish Armed Forces.

Compared to its contemporaries, the T-90 is one of the best protected tanks in the world and also one of the most heavily armed combat systems. As with other Soviet-era tanks, the T-90 makes use of an integrated autoloader, three-man crew and low profile design.\n\r\nWith the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991, the Russian military fell into a period of low morale and curtailed spending. As such, many projects were either shelved indefinitely or canceled altogether. During the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Army enjoyed the prospect of fielding two Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) side-by-side, beginning with the introduction of the T-64 in 1963. This was then later complemented by the T-72 of 1971. Both tank designs showcased an autoloader feeding a large-caliber 125mm smoothbore main gun. The T-64 was designed as the technology-laden (and therefore more expensive) primary Soviet Army tank solution while the T-72 was intended as the cheaper, production-/export-friendly mark. In the end, however, it was the T-72 that gained the larger legacy thanks to export sales while the T-64 was limited to Soviet territories due to its \"state secret\" status. The T-64 was then modernized to become the T-80 and qualities of the popular T-72 were included in this revised design. \n\r\nThe T-80 entered service in 1976 and became the primary MBT of the Soviet Army up until the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991. The T-80 was notable in its use of a gas turbine engine which promised higher power output over that of traditional diesel-fueled tank engines. However, the powerpack was never wholly reliable and proved more fuel thirsty, uneconomical and complicated to produce.\n\r\nRealizing an uncertain world was now upon them, Russian authorities began debating the merits of producing and operating two similar-yet-different concurrent MBT solutions. As such, the focus fell onto developing a modernized form of the T-72 with key qualities of the T-80 to overtake the aging pair of fighting vehicles. The fire control system of the T-80 was mated to the T-72 frame while an autoloading facility was retained as was the proven 125mm smoothbore main gun - this amalgam creating the prototype designation of \"T-88\". The engine of choice fell to a diesel-fueled installation capable of 830 horsepower and the resulting product was then adopted as the \"T-90\", essentially an evolution of the original T-72 line.\n\r\nLow-rate production of T-90 tanks began in 1993 and these were eventually followed by full-rate production vehicles beginning in 1995. Since then, some 1,670 T-90 tanks have been produced for Russia and several operators worldwide. Production is handled by the local concern of Uralvagonzavod based in Nizhny Tagil, Russia.\n\r\nAs in the T-72 before it, the T-90 utilizes a very low profile thanks to its two-man turret housing the commander and gunner (commander right, gunner left). The autoloader is of a carousel design perfected throughout the decades and feeds the projectile and charge from two separate rungs. As in previous Soviet tanks, the T-90 supports firing of guided anti-tank missiles from the main gun barrel and this can engage ground as well as aerial targets (helicopters). The driver is seated in the front-center of the hull with the turret immediately behind. The engine is situated in a rear compartment apart from the crew. The track system straddles the hull in the usual way and is dominated by its six double-tired, rubber-tiredroad wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear and the track idler at the front. Side skirt armor is a standard defensive measure seen on all T-90 tanks. The glacis plate is nearly vertical and adds basic protection against incoming enemy fire. Likewise, the turret is very squat with pointed edges, again providing a basic defense policy against incoming penetrating projectiles. The commander is afforded a raised cupola with vision blocks while the gunner manages his own turret roof hatch for entry/exit. Armor protection is a mix of steel and composites and further benefits from add-on Explosive Reactive Armor blocks (\"Kontakt-5\") providing protection from HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank), APFSDS (Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, Discarding Sabot) rounds, kinetic and chemical penetrators. Blocks are affixed to the hull front, sides and turret as required. \r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-90", "vehicle_type": "Main Battle Tank (MBT)"}, {"id": "21ede880-cf85-433a-9532-1c1ea5125a02", "year_model": "1993", "description": "\r\n        \tThe A-222 \"Bereg\" was born from development work occurring during the late-Cold War years and not formally unveiled until 1993 at an Abu Dhabi exhibition.

Its firepower can just as easily be turned against land-based targets.\n\r\nIts introduction into Russian service is interesting, particularly in an age where missiles dominate the battlefield and conventionally-minded coastal defense weaponry is not part of the frontline inventory of any major military.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "A-222 Bereg (130mm Coastal Defense Gun)", "vehicle_type": "8x8 Wheeled Self-Propelled Heavy Gun Carrier"}, {"id": "037b7f95-019c-444e-b67a-2a193eea2ae8", "year_model": "1990", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BMD-3 was a further installment in the relatively successful line of light amphibious, air-droppable infantry fighting vehicles serving with Soviet airborne forces. The BMD series was technically billed an \"airborne combat vehicle\" though its field operation was more akin to a traditional \"infantry fighting vehicle\" (IFV). The series was based the dimensionally larger and heavier BMP series of IFVs which was produced in the BMP-1, BMP-2 and BMP-3 marks. The original BMD (BMD-1) was first unveiled in 1969 to which then the improved BMD-2 was showcased beginning in 1985. Both saw combat service in the Soviet war in Afghanistan alongside the larger BMP models - though proving susceptible to land mines and rocket propelled grenades (the BMP/BMD was designed to fight in Europe). The BMD-3, therefore, was the third evolution of the BMD fighting line intended to provide lightly armed Soviet airborne personnel with a capable armored fighting vehicle. The BMD-3 was designed alongside the BMD-2 model which utilized a smaller version of the BMP-2 turret. The BMD-3, therefore, was given the full-size version of the BMP-2 turret and all of its inherently beneficial qualities. The BMD-3 entered service with the Red Army in 1990 and retains a presence in the Russian military of today. Production was handled out of the Volgograd Tractor Factory as in versions prior. The project name for the BMD-3 model was Obyekt 950 and the BMD designation stood for \"Boyevaya Machina Desanta\" which, when translated, simply detailed its field use (\"Combat Vehicle Airborne\").\n\r\nThe BMP-3 retained much of the design lines of the BMP/BMD series prior. The hull was rather basic with slab sides, a raised front and a well-sloped glacis plate. The driver maintained a position at the center front flanked by a pair of seating positions for additional crew. The turret was now large enough to fit two crew and this would be generally staffed with the vehicle commander and the primary gunner. Three smoke grenade dischargers were fitted to each turret side. The fighting compartment was held at the center of the hull with the engine at the rear. Waterjets mounted at the lower hull rear allowed for fully amphibious capabilities - a trademark of Soviet armored vehicle designs. The track system encompassed five small road wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear and the track idler at the front as well as four track return rollers. Armor was a light aluminum alloy arrangement at the hull with steel used on the turret. Wider tracks were also available as necessary (480mm from the original 320mm types).\n\r\nPrimary armament was the 30mm 2A42 cannon which was augmented by a coaxial 7.62mm PK series machine gun. The power-operated two-man turret was also home to an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher. Secondary armament included a 30mm AGS-17 series automatic grenade launcher (front left hull) and a 5.45mm RPKS general purpose machine gun in the bow (front right hull). Overall, the BMD-3 was a very well-armed machine that could be called upon to tackle various enemy types - including Main Battle Tanks. 860 x 30mm projectiles were carried for the main gun as well as 4 x ATGMs. 2,000 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition were also stowed aboard as was 2,160 rounds of 5.45mm ammunition. 551 grenades were carried for the 30mm grenade launcher.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMD-3 (Boyevaya Mashina Desanta)", "vehicle_type": "Airborne Amphibious Light Tank / Infantry Fighting Vehicle"}, {"id": "12fa51c8-c47e-447c-a9d8-6b2144ebdd2b", "year_model": "1990", "description": "\r\n        \tThe lightweight all-terrain vehicle will always have a place on the battlefield which is why designs like the French Vehicle Blinde Leger (VBL) are still in existence and have proven utterly popular with global operators. This 4x4 armored car was developed to a 1978 French Army requirement calling for a lightweight/lightly-armored reconnaissance car that could double as a weapons carrier. This resulted in pilot (prototype) vehicles emerging from the storied French concerns of Panhard and Renault. After the requisite Army evaluations were had, the Panhard offering was adopted for serial production and formal service in February of 1985. Production began in 1990 and continues today (2017).\n\r\nThe vehicle takes on a traditional automobile form with the engine in a frontal compartment and driver at front-left. There is a passenger seat to his right and a large console in-between. Roof hatches are featured over the driver and passenger positions and a third is set over the rear edge of the hull roof. Automobile-style doors provide entry/exit for the two front occupants. Various weapon types can be installed over the hull roof (at center) including machine guns, automatic cannons, and Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) launchers making the VBL something of an all-in-one battlefield solution. Wheels are set against the far corners of the design for excellent balance and the chassis sits high off the ground to promote strong ground clearance characteristics - useful in off road travel. Armor protection is up to STANAG Level 1, which covers small arms fire up to 7.62mm as well as artillery spray and mine fragmentation. Multiple glass facings are bullet resistant to an extent. Power to the drive system is from a Peugeot XD3T turbo-diesel engine developing 95 horsepower. Operational range is out to 600 kilometers though this can be augmented with external fuel stores to reach as far out as 1,000 kilometers. Road speeds maximize at 95 kmh. An amphibious capability is built into the VBL's design (a propeller is set at the hull rear for propulsion).\n\r\nDimensions include a length of 3.8 meters with a width of 2 meters and a height of 1.7 meters. Weight is up to 4 tonnes. These qualities allow the VBL to be air-transportable in the belly of a Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport or similar medium-class hauler.\n\r\nPrimary French models include the MILAN missile carrier (anti-tank platform), the ERYX missile carrier (anti-tank platform), the POSTE de COMMANDEMENT Command and Control (C2) vehicle, the RECO 12.7 infantry support vehicle, and the AT4CS anti-tank weapons carrier.\n\r\nIn French hands, the VBL has seen combat exposure in the former Yugoslavia, the Ivory Coast, Afghanistan and the Mali Intervention. Much of its time abroad has been spent in support of  UN-led peacekeeping endeavors to war-torn parts of the world.\n\r\nExportation of the VBL has been strong with operators seen from Benin and Botswana to Togo and the United Arab Emirates. The largest VBL operator outside of France has become Oman (132) followed by Nigeria (72). The vehicle provides a relatively cheap security system for budget-conscious shoppers. Export models include the ULTRAV M11 NBC reconnaissance platform, the TOW missile carrier (anti-tank system), the MISTRAL missile carrier (air defense system),  the CANON with 20mm auto cannon turret, and the TOURELLE FERMEE featuring a Remote Weapon Station (RWS) mounting a 12.7 heavy-caliber machine gun.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Panhard VBL (Vehicule Blinde Leger)", "vehicle_type": "Amphibious Wheeled Armored Scout Car"}, {"id": "7502d1c7-514b-407b-bd49-749b90a1eccd", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tFor decades the Russian / Soviet Army had placed a premium on effective artillery pieces for effective armor-defeating measures. This is seen in the \"Sprut\" (\"Kraken\") series of Anti-Tank (AT) guns currently in service with Russian forces and several select global customers. The weapon is capable of engaging enemy armor through Armor-Piercing (AP) shells at range while also having a general anti-infantry capability through firing High-Explosive (HE) shells. Design of the Sprut was through the Petrov Design Bureau during the latter half of the 1980s just prior to the fall of the Soviet Empire. Manufacture has been handled out of the Artillery Plant No.9 since 1989, the same ear the Sprut formally entered military service.\n\r\nAs finalized, the gun features a transport weight of 14,300 pounds with a firing weight close to 14,500 pounds. It sports an overall length of 23.3 feet and features a barrel of 125mm caliber (4.9\"). The recoil mechanism is hydropneumatic and assists in providing gunnery crews a rate-of-fire of 6 to 8 rounds-per-minute out to ranges reaching 13,300 yards using conventional HE shells. AP shells reach 2,200 yards. Sighting is through an OP4M-48A sighting device. While seated on a two-wheeled towable tripod assembly, an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) is fitted to provide short-distance transport at roughly 9 miles per hour. Otherwise, the system is towed into action using traditional mover vehicles like the MT-LB carrier. The standard operating crew of this gun is seven personnel which are trained to arrange the gun to be readied for fire in two minutes or less.\n\r\nIn one way, the Sprut system is logistically-friendly for the Russian military and its foreign customers as relies on the same ammunition stock already in circulation for the T-64, T-72, T-80 and T-90 Russian Main Battle Tanks (MBTs). The ammunition is also used in the D-81 towed gun family.\n\r\nTo date the Sprut is featured in three distinct forms: the 2A45 \"Sprut-A\" is the standard towed AT weapon while the 2A45M \"Sprut-B\" is the self-propelled version of the same gun. The 2S25 \"Sprut-SD\" is another self-propelled gun system, though more along the lines of portable fire support, and fits the related 125mm 2A75 gun onto the BMD-3 chassis complete with powered turret assembly.\n\r\nOperators of the Sprut family are seen in Mexico, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), Singapore and Ukraine.

The vehicle is similar in design, scope and function to contemporary Western designs including the American M109 and British AS90 series of tracked gun platforms. Hundreds of 2S19 units have been delivered since the type's inception with foreign operators being mainly nations maintaining close diplomatic ties with Russia.\n\r\nThe 2S19 system originated form an attempt by the Russian Army to modernize its self-propelled artillery reach in the 1980s. Design work began in 1985 and the pilot vehicle (prototype), known under the designation of \"Obyekt 317\" (\"Object 317\"), soon appeared, built upon the chassis of the proven T-80 Main Battle Tank. Interestingly, the inherent T-80 engine was dropped in favor of the powerplant as utilized by the T-72 Main Battle Tank series. After clearing all requisite field evaluations, the pilot vehicle emerged in production form as the 2S19 MSTA (MSTA translating to \"Mobile Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery\" in the Russian). Service entry was noted in 1989 with the introduction of the 2S19 MSTA-S (\"S\" marking the self-propelled version of the gun, the alternative being \"MSTA-B\" to designate towed versions of the same gun in field form).\n\r\nOutwardly, the 2S9 vehicle promotes a rather conventional appearance as modern self-propelled artillery systems go. It features a low-profile chassis and hull structure straddled by long-running track systems while its primary armament is set within a large, boxy turret emplacement fitted to the middle rear of the hull roof. The turret houses the gunnery crew as well as the main gun and recoil mechanism needed to contain the violent recoil of such a large-caliber weapon system. The turret overhangs the bow of the hull and is capped by a double-baffle muzzle brake. A fume extractor is identified at the barrel's midway point. When in transport mode, the barrel is affixed to a inverse \"Vee\" type assembly to lock the barrel in place. Crew accommodations amount to five personnel including the driver, vehicle commander, gunner, loader and charge manager. The driver is the only crewmember separated from the rest of the group, taking a position in the front-center of the hull. The crew is afforded a full NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) suite while the driver has access to a passive night vision system. A bulldozer-type blade is standard and allows the 2S19 crew to dig out their own emplacement prior to firing. A wading kit is also issued to allow the 2S19 to ford certain water sources (up to 5 meters deep) in keeping with accepted Soviet/Russian armored warfare doctrine. The vehicle is powered by a single V-84A series diesel-fueled engine developing 840 horsepower ()some have been fitted with the 46-6 series diesel instead), providing the 2S19 with a top road speed of 37 miles per hour and an approximate operational range of 310 miles. The engine system is fitted to a compartment in the rear of the hull. Like other vehicles in this class, the 2S19 is further powered by an integrated auxiliary generator that allows all primary firing functions to be operational without the engine running.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S19 MSTA", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Artillery (SPA) Vehicle"}, {"id": "5bbfd497-c2d1-4692-8c31-cb38c1eda12a", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tLong relying on large collections of Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRSs) as cheap, effective fire support weapons, the Soviet Army adopted the BM-30 \"Smerch\" (\"Whirlwind\") series in 1989 for its long-range, battlefield rocket projection needs. The type was formed from the chassis of the MAZ-543M (or MAZ-79111) series of 8x8 wheeled heavy military trucks and included a forward-set crew compartment (front-left) and a rear-mounted, trainable launcher unit containing twelve 300mm launch tubes. Able to fire rockets containing a variety of warheads (including chemical types), the Smerch saw widespread adoption with Soviet-supported and aligned nations and states from Armenia to Venezuela. Even after the dissolution of the Soviet Empire, the vehicles were passed on to successor states while local models has been maintained by the new Russian Army. While its footprint today remains evermore limited compared to its peak worldwide usage period, the vehicle still holds much battlefield value to its operators.\n\r\nRussia manages a current (2015) stock of over 100 systems though the series has since been superseded on paper by the adoption of the more modern 9A52-4 \"Tornado\" line (detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nThe Smerch series is a whole weapon system containing several key critical components for effective functioning. BM 9A52-2 is the 8-wheeled launch vehicle making up the heart of the system. It is a unit weighing nearly 44 tons (long) and features  a length of 12 meters with a width of 3 meters and a height of 3 meters. It is powered by a single V-12 D12A-525A series diesel-fueled engine developing 525 horsepower located at the vehicle's front-right side. The hull is suspended across all eight vehicles allowing a cross-country capability. Road speeds reach 37 miles per hour with operational ranges out to 530 miles.\n\r\nThe launcher component of the launch vehicle sits over the rear section of the truck and features traverse and elevation controlling which means the vehicle can be parked facing any direction. The launch tubes are arranged in three groups of four tubes each with two groups set across from one another in a 2x2 arrangement. The remaining tubes are arranged in a single row across the top of the other eight - this helps to clear the lift controls and support structure found at the base of the launcher pack. Prior to firing, the vehicle must come to a complete stop and have its recoil legs lowered. The operating cabin for the launcher is featured aft of the driver's compartment and over/between the first and second axles. The Smerch can be made ready-to-fire in three minutes and displace (move to another location) in a little as two. Its twelve rocket payload can clear the launcher unit in 38 seconds while reloading takes approximately 20 minutes.\n\r\nThe TZM 9T234-2 serves as the reload vehicle / ammunition carrier and carries with it twelve 300mm rockets. 1K123 \"Vivary\" designates the accompanying Command Post (CP) component and the PM-2-70 MTO-V serves as the system's direct maintenance / support vehicle. 9A52 formally designates the BM-30 series and now includes the 9A52-4, a lighter-weight model featured on a KamAZ-6350 series truck with variable launcher packs supported (as such it is made more modular). 9A52-2T designates the export Smerch featuring a Tatra T816 series truck chassis.\n\r\nOver the life of the BM-30's operational service, several rocket projectiles were developed beyond the standard 9M528 High-Explosive, Fragmentation (HI-FRAG) variant. This has come to include cluster-based munition/mine dispensers (anti-personnel, anti-tank types), HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) rockets, and thermobaric (high temperature fuel-air bomb) rockets.\n\r\nDespite its Cold War origins, the Smerch series was not used in combat until the 2014 during the Syrian Civil War by government forces against rebel groups. That same year, it was featured by Ukrainian government forces in their offensives against Russian-backed rebels in the Ukrainian east. While an unknown number of Syrian Army BM-30s remain in service, the Ukrainian Army was known to possess some near-100 systems at one point. Pakistan locally produces the BM-30 as the A-100E through its Supako Factory of Karachi. Some 36 vehicles have since entered service with the Pakistani Army. Neighboring India is another operator with 42 9A52-2T models in service.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BM-30 (Smerch) / 9A52-2", "vehicle_type": "8x8 Wheeled Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)"}, {"id": "80f8a854-f666-4038-85f9-98b6eab1078b", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tLogistics remains at the heart of every military initiative. A massive land fighting force like the modern Russian Army understands this quite well and employs a vast collection of logistically-minded vehicles to support most any ground campaign.

It is actively manufactured today (2018) despite its Cold War-era origins.\n\r\nThe truck has four axles fitting two wheels each and these axles are separated in two forward pairs and two aft pairs. The roadwheels are large, providing the vehicle with excellent ground clearance aiding in cross-country travel. Over the front of the truck is the crew cab which seats the driver at front-left. Earlier production models fitted a cab from the company KAMAZ while later models moved to a new cab design developed with the assistance of Italian-based IVECO. The engine is situated forward in the design with the aft section taken up by the cargo bed which is typically covered from the elements. Up to 10 tons of goods can be hauled in this area and the truck can tow 16 tons as needed. Other features of the truck include a remote tire pressure control system, leaf spring suspension.\n\r\nThe unit is powered by a YaMZ-238B V-8 turbo-diesel engine of 300 horsepower (2,000rpm). This is mated to an 8x2 transmission system with locking transaxle differential. The truck can make a top speed of 53 miles per hour out to a range of 650 miles.

This series, however, ultimately emerged as a completely different form from the multi-wheeled S-300 airspace denial units. It was given to a different developer and manufacturer than those of the S-300 family while featuring altogether different missiles - the 9M82 \"Giant\" and the 9M83 \"Gladiator\". Two- and four-shot launcher forms were devised and the types have been fielded in the anti-ballistic missile role while also being able to provide protection against inbound aerial threats - such as aircraft and cruise missiles - at long range. It still sees service on today's battlefields despite its Cold War roots.\n\r\nThe S-300V series was taken into service in 1983 and full-strength was eventually before the end of the decade; around 1988.\n\r\nThe S-300V utilizes the chassis of the MT-T carrier tracked combat vehicle. The tracked nature of this chassis allows it to travel cross-country easily enough while keeping pace with the main mechanized fighting force. Over the top of the vehicle are large launch tubes housing the primary armament of 9M82 \"Giant\" or 9M83 series missiles and the launcher is hinged along the rear edge of the hull and propped upwards when the tubes are made ready-to-fire. The missiles can not only engage at long range but also high altitude - making them doubly-dangerous.

MLRSs are used as indirect fire weapons over range, often times attached to artillery regiments for massed firepower. Battlefield rockets have provided a tactical and psychological effect on enemy forces for generations and continues to do so today. Many modern armies stock special vehicles like MLRSs as a result.\n\r\nOmsk Transmash Design Bureau of the former Soviet Union headed design work on the vehicle in 1988. Obvious modifications to the existing T-72A model MBT included removal of its entire turret assembly, this structure accordingly replaced by a large and rectangular multi-shot rocket pack seated atop a traversing mount. The vehicle retained the original tank's crew of three and weighed 100,000 lb. Dimensions included a running length of 9.5 meters with a width of 3.6 meters and height of 2.22 meters. Power was through a standard V-84 diesel-fueled engine developing 840 horsepower. Performance specifications included a road speed of 37 miles per hour with an operational range out to 340 miles.\n\r\nThe multi-shot launcher pod was originally given 30 launch tubes in the TOS-1M variant. This was later reduced to 24 in the TOS-1A upgrade with sported a 3 x 8 tube arrangement. The rockets were of 220mm caliber and could carry variable warhead types to engage fortifications, light armored vehicles, and troops out in the open. The vehicle has been resupplied through a pair of accompanying TZM-T (KrAZ-255B) trucks which are modified especially for the rocket resupply role.\n\r\nPilot vehicles were evaluated operationally from 1988 into 1989 during the latter stages of the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) and found to be useful short-to-medium range assault weapons.

This knowledge was integrated and evolved across many post-war developments that were devised for another (possible) -large-scale war - this time against the West - during the Cold War decades that followed. It was Soviet engineers that were the first to introduced the concept of the \"Infantry Fighting Vehicle\" (IFV) to the world, combing the best aspects of a Light Tank (speed and firepower) with that of an Armored Personnel Carrier (\"APC\") (armor protection) which ultimately gave rise to the BMP-1 of 1966.\n\r\nThe BMP-1 proved a success for both the Soviet Army and its worldwide allies. However, the design featured some inherent limitations that spurred development of an improved type, particularly after actions in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and the Soviet-Afghanistan War that engulfed much of the 1980s, the latter adding to the Soviet Empire's downfall in 1991. This brought about development and ultimate production of a new and improved type in the BMP-2 of 1980/1982. The BMP-2 reworked the internal arrangement of the BMP-1, relocated the commander to the turret and a more advantageous position, integrated smoke grenade launchers, revised the primary armament suite from a 73mm canon to a more accurate 30mm system and brought about support for more lethal anti-tank guided missiles launched from an installed launcher. Both the BMP-1 and BMP-2 were produced in the tens of thousands and saw circulation to over 40 countries worldwide with many still in service today.\n\r\nDuring the development of the BMP-2 in the mid-1970s, there emerged a prototype - Ob'yekt 685 - mounting a 100mm 2A48-1 series main gun in a traversing turret. Development occurred at the Kurganmashzavod Plant in Kurgan, Russia. The prototype was then evolved into pilot vehicle Ob'yekt 688 with its new powerpack while still retaining much of the same form, performance and amphibious qualities of the preceding BMP-1 and BMP-2 family lines. Development of the type continued into the 1980s to which the vehicle was then sent through the requisite state trials, formally adopted by the Red Army in 1987. Limited production vehicles were then delivered before serial manufacture of the type began in 1989. The vehicle, now recognized as the \"BMP-3\", was first made aware to Western eyes during a 1990 Moscow parade which earned it the NATO codename of  \"M1990\" for lack of a better series marker.\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes, the BMP-3 continues the line begun through the original BMP-1 of 1966 though it should be recognized that the newer series incorporates several design changes which decidedly separate it from the BMP-1 and BMP-2 marks. Attention has been given to increased crew and systems protection which has resulted in slightly increased armor thickness (as much as 35mm) across critical frontal facings. Six electrically-charged smoke grenade launchers (three to a front turret side) allow the vehicle to set its own screen during maneuvers or retreats though the engine-based smoke screen system of the BMP-1 and BMP-2 has been retained. The operating crew remains three standard personnel to include the driver, commander and gunner. The driver is seated in the front-center hull (as opposed to offset-left in the BMP-1/BMP-2) with the commander and gunner in the two-man turret (commander at right, gunner at left). The vehicle can transport up to seven combat-ready infantrymen with five housed in the rear passenger compartment and two flanking the driver in the front hull (each with roof hatches). In the BMP-3, the relocated engine (from the front to the rear-right) now allowed the driver to be seated at center. Five firing ports were given to the fighting compartment. The powerpack - a UTD-29M series diesel-fueled engine - outputs at an impressive 500 horsepower which is an increase over that of the BMP-2's 300 horsepower system. Road speeds reach 45 miles per hour with operational ranges of 370 miles (BMP-2 topped 45mph and 370 miles respectively). An NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) suite is standard as is an automatic fire suppression system. Night vision is afforded all three crew. ERA (Explosive Reactive Armor) blocks are available for BMP-3 vehicles to further increase protection from next generation penetrators.\n\r\nAs in the BMP-1 and BMP-2 series prior, the BMP-3 retained full amphibious qualities consistent with Soviet armored warfare doctrine. After some slight preparation by the crew (erected trim vane, bilge pumps turned on), the BMP-3 could traverse deep bodies of water, propelled as such by two water jets fitted to the lower rear hull (the BMP-2 relied on the motion of its tracks). Fording speed is an acceptable 6.2mph.\n\r\nThe BMP-3 also retains the six, double-tired road wheel configuration of the BMP-1/BMP-2 with the drive sprocket now moved to the rear of the vehicle and the track idler relocated from the rear to the front. Three track return rollers are still features in the track arrangement and the upper regions are partially protected by a short armored skirt. Suspension is via a torsion bar system and is completely adjustable by the driver \"on-the-fly\" to content with variable terrain.\n\r\nThe BMP-3 design makes for a low profile thanks to its short hull superstructure and stout turret assembly. The glacis plate is well-sloped leading up to the hull roof line as normal. The sides of the hull are vertical but short which makes direct flank attacks against the vehicle by anti-tank weaponry somewhat difficult. The engine has been relocated from the front right of the hull to the rear right which allows for an offset-left passenger cabin and entry/exit by passengers is still through two hinged, outward-opening rear doors (steps lower as doors are opened to content with the hull's rather high ground clearance). Fuel stores are located under the hull floor. Hatches are found at the passenger cabin roof, three over the front hull and two at the turret roof.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMP-3 (Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty)", "vehicle_type": "Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) / Light Tank"}, {"id": "ea76c17c-310d-4ae5-8fd0-756f0843040b", "year_model": "1987", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BTR-80 was the logical evolution of the wheeled armored personnel carrier (APC) BTR series that more or less hit its stride in the 1960s with the development of the BTR-60. The BTR-80 itself was developed to replace both the BTR-60 and the similar BTR-70 models and entered production in 1986, seeing operational service soon after. The BTR-80 was based on the lessons learned from the design and operation of the BTR-70 and incorporated several key strengths of its design while bringing into the fold various technological suites as required by today's battlefield environments.\n\r\nTaking the BTR-70 as a starting point, Soviet engineers did away with the twin gasoline engine setup of the former BTR-60 and BTR-70 designs and instead fitted a single V-form 8-cylinder KamAZ-7403 series diesel engine to deliver 260 horsepower at 2,600rpm. The characteristic eight road wheel arrangement was retained. The implementation of the new powerplant required some restructuring of the rear engine compartment which raised the rear hull line. Modernized sighting devices (nightvision to both the driver and the commander) were installed as was an infra-red search light. Armament was fitted to a revised, low-profile one-man turret and given 360-degree traverse and 60+ degrees elevation to counter low flying aircraft and engage targets even if the vehicle was hampered along sloped terrain. Primary armament came in the form of a 14.5mm KPVT anti-aircraft heavy machine gun supported by a 7.62mm PKT general purpose machine gun.\n\r\nThe standard operating crew included the driver, commander and gunner while up to eight combat ready soldiers could be ferried in relative safety in the revised fighting compartment. The driver and commander were situated at the front of the hull under the shallow glacis plate while the gunner manned the powered turret system. Passengers could take part in a given firefight thanks to the inclusion of rounded firing ports complete with ball mounts located at the side (three each side) and front facings of the hull. The vehicle's operating weight was listed at nearly 15,000kg while displaying a running length of 7.65 meters, a width of 2.90 meters and a height of 2.35 meters. Independent suspension and drive power was afforded to all eight wheels and operational ranges were listed out to 600 kilometers. Steering was assisted at the front four wheels only. A centralized tire air pressure system maintained the required levels to all eight wheel systems and was controlled by the driver for when managing varied terrain \"on-the-fly\".\n\r\nThe BTR-80 was designed with a certain level of self-survivability in mind and could manage to lose two of its eight road wheels and still keep itself viable. Top speed was 80 kilometers on smooth paved surfaces, lesser on rough and uneven terrain. The BTR-80 was given amphibious capabilities and could traverse relatively calm waters at roughly 9 kilometers per hour with its integrated water jet propulsion system that required no outward preparation by the crew. The crew was also protected in the event of nuclear fallout and chemical weapons by a new Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) suite and a pressurized fighting compartment. Six 81mm smoke grenade dischargers were fitted to the rear of the turret and set to fire forwards for self-protection in a combat environment. Armor was designed heavy enough to deflect or stop small arms fire and artillery spray but was not specifically designed to withstand direct hits from larger caliber weapons, rocket grenades or anti-tank missile weapons. Troops exited/entered the BTR-80 hull through split doors found on the hull sides between the forward and rearward wheel pairings (between axles two and three). Each door was split horizontally with the upper portion hinged to open forwards and the lower portion folded down to become a step capable of supporting the weight of a soldier. A third door section along the hull roof could similarly flip upwards (towards centerline) for increased headroom and speedy insertion/extractions.\n\r\nOnce in service, the BTR-80 had proven a winner for the Red Army, with off-road performance equal to that of any tracked vehicle systems coupled with excellent on-road performance. Where it lacked in protection and firepower (not its specifically designed forte) it made up for in mobility and speed. Such was the success of the BTR-80 that it went into service with a plethora of national armies the world over including Columbia, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, North Korea and South Korea among others. The Ukrainians took initiative and branched their BTR-80 series family into further improved indigenous lines to benefit their mobile army units. The BTR-80 chassis has also proven highly adaptable to the fitting of various armament types (machine guns, cannons) as well as flexible enough for several required battlefield roles to include that of command vehicle, battlefield ambulance, signals vehicle and mobile communications station.\n\r\nA new YaMZ-238M2 engine was introduced into the BTR-80 line in 1993, further enhancing inherent capabilities. As of this writing, at least 5,000 BTR-80s have been placed into service with 35 countries.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BTR-80", "vehicle_type": "Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "9eacea04-c03c-47e4-acba-0b2676cf9f0c", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tWith the rise of ever-faster and more powerful warplanes in the 1960s and 1970s, the missile age was forged as a direct counter. This led both the East and West of the Cold War period (1947-1991) to fund development of all manner of missile-based defenses. For the Soviet Union, this led to the creation of a new self-propelled Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system known as the 9K330 'Tor' (NATO codename of SA-15 \"Gauntlet\"). The system was specifically designed to engage aerial targets in the low-to-medium altitude envelopes - making it ideal for area defense.\n\r\nDesign work began in 1975 with Antey OKB leading the charge aided by MKB Fakel supplying the missile component. Manufacture of the series, introduced in 1986, was undertaken by IEMZ Kupol, Metrowagonmash (managing production of the tracked chassis), and MZKT (providing a wheeled chassis derivative). Production of the line has since spanned from 1983 until the present day and variants of the series now include the original 'Tor' and subsequent notable marks of enhanced capability - the 9K330 has been progressively modernized to keep it a viable air-defense missile platform for the foreseeable future.\n\r\nAt its core, the 9K330 features an operating crew of three and weighs in at 34 tonnes in its tracked chassis guise. Overall length of the chassis reaches 7.5 meters with a beam of 3.3 meters and a height up to the hull roof line of 5.1 meters. The tracking radar sits atop the hull and can be stowed away during transport. Power is from a V-12 diesel -fueled engine of 830 horsepower driving the conventional track-and-wheel running gear, the engine being mated to a hydromechanical gearbox. The hull is suspended atop a proven torsion bar suspension system ideal for offroad traveling and the vehicle complete can reach road speeds of up to 65 kmh and operate out to ranges of 500 kilometers - allowing it to keep up with the main mechanized force is need be.\n\r\nThe included solid-fueled, rocket-boosted missiles of the 9K330 SAM system are typically fielded in packs of four ready-to-launch munitions. These 10-foot long weapons are designed to engage more agile targets at range, the missiles reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Guidance is through a command-input system allowing for changes/corrections on-the-fly while detonation is through an onboard proximity fuse-based arrangement. The base missiles have a listed engagement range out to 12 kilometers giving the overall vehicle a good \"reach\" in a warzone. The weapons can target and engage enemies at altitudes beyond 30,000 feet (depending on missile mark).\n\r\nThe Tor SAM system is currently (2020) operated by the military forces of Algeria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Peru, Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela, Yemen, Morocco, and Syria. Russia is, by far, the largest operator of the series with some 172 units in service with production currently ongoing. Georgia and Kazakhstan has both given up use of the missile system.\n\r\nRussian forces deployed the Tor SAM system in the Syrian Civil War in support of the acting/current regime.\n\r\nVariants of the 9K330 SAM system include the original 9K330 'Tor' unit of 1986, these followed by the improved 9K331 'Tor M1' mark of 1991 which brought along the new 9M331 missile of greater accuracy and a multi-target engagement capability. The 9K332 'Tor-M2E' became an upgraded model of 2007 and marks the latest widespread version available - boasting an all-new, more accurate fire control capability as well as greater automation with increased reaction times. The smaller size of these missiles allow eight to be housed in a pack while engagement ranges are increased to 16 kilometers.\n\r\nThe 'Tor-M1-2U' is a model of 2012 given a broader target reach - therefore more useful against smaller UAVs becoming commonplace over the modern battlefield as well as traditional large fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. An all-weather capability is built in, increasing the tactical flexibility of the unit. This form is beginning to become available in useful numbers as of this writing.\n\r\nThe 'Tor-M2KM' is more of a versatile \"mount-anywhere\" version with a 15 kilometer engagement range while the 'Tor-M2DT' is designed for cold weather operation (particularly in the Arctic environment where weather extremes prove more common). The 'Tor-2E' is a more mobile, versatile offering being marketed along with a wheeled vehicle chassis equipped with 16-shot missile modules and intra-vehicle communications for a shared exchange of target information.\n\r\nThe navalized form of the Gauntlet became the 3K95 'Kinzhal' (exported as 'Klinok') known to NATO as SA-N-9.  These missiles were introduced in 1989 and are similar in form and function to the 9M330 land-based weapons though optimized for on-water/over-water operation against aerial targets. The weapons are typically fitted on mid-to-large Russian Navy warships.\n\r\nThe HQ-17/FM-2000 is a Chinese variant thought to be based on the Soviet/Russian Tor SAM system.\n\r\nDespite its Cold War-era roots, the Tor SAM system maintains an active presence around the world, primarily with Soviet/Russian allied partners and nations.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-15 (Gauntlet) / 9K330 Tor", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) Vehicle"}, {"id": "a5625a6f-c1d1-482e-85d7-26a456c75da7", "year_model": "1985", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BMD-2 was a further evolution of the BMD-1 line of amphibious light infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) intended to be air-droppable for awaiting Soviet paratrooper elements. The BMD-1 was itself a scaled-down version of the full-sized BMP-1 series IFV and entered service in 1969 - the BMD-1 was designed to utilize the turret of the BMP-1 and provide lightly armed airborne forces with a hard-hitting vehicle until arrival of the main force. When the BMP-1 line was developed into the improved \"BMP-2\" series of the 1980s, thought was given to fit its new turret configuration into a modified form of the BMD line and this ultimately produced the \"Obyekt 916\" program designation which led to the development of the \"BMD-2\". Design work on the new vehicle spanned from 1981 to 1985 to which the new BMD-2 was adopted for Red Army use thereafter. Production was handled out of the Volgograd Tractor Plant. As with the BMD-1 and BMP-1 (and the BMP-2 for that matter), the BMD-2 also saw combat service with Soviet forces in the war in Afghanistan.\n\r\nOutwardly, the BMD-2 mimicked much of what was the BMD-1 before it. The basic shape of the BMP family was still largely retained just on a smaller scale. The hull was very boat-like in its design with a raised front end for wading water sources and a heavily sloped glacis plate provided basic ballistics protection. The driver managed a position at the front hull with the fighting compartment directly behind. The turret was situated ahead of amidships with the engine at the rear. The hull was straddled by running gear made up of five road wheels with the requisite track idler, drive sprocket and track return rollers in place. The hull roof was largely flat and vision blocks allowed the driver, commander and gunner limited observation ports of the action ahead. Armor construction was of welded aluminum alloy which presented minimal protection to the crew but made for a lighter overall vehicle. As the BMD series was always intended to be for airborne troops, it was also intended to be air droppable on parachuting pallets emerging from passing transport aircraft. Overall weight was 11.5 tons and the standard operating crew was four (driver, commander, gunner and machine gunner) with room for four combat-ready troops.\n\r\nArmament was primarily contained in the small turret which housed the 30mm 2A42 cannon. Like later production versions of the BMD-1, the BMD-2 could also fire anti-tank guided missiles for a truly devastating reach against all modern tanks of the time. Secondary armament came in the form of a 7.62mm PKT machine gun in a coaxial mounting in the turret. There was an additional 7.62mm PKT machine gun in the bow for increased defense. 300 rounds of 30mm ammunition were carried and separated between armor-piercing and high-explosive warheads for use on armored and non-armored targets respectively. 2,940 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition was also carried for the machine guns.\n\r\nPower for the BMD-2 was derived from the 5D-20 diesel-fueled 6-cylinder liquid-cooled engine developing 241 horsepower at 2,600 - largely comparable to the BMD-1's system. A top road speed of 80 km/h was reported as was a 450 kilometer operational range. The hull was suspended on a torsion bar suspension system and ground clearance was adjustable by the driver. The BMD-2 also retained the amphibious quality of the BMP-1/BMP-2/BMD-1 series which made for a more adaptable tactical instrument of war. The vehicle was propelled in the water by a pair of waterjets fitted to the rear hull. Considering the landscape of Western Europe - most likely to become the battlefield of choice in the Cold War, this was forward-thinking.\n\r\nThe BMD-2 only existed across three notable variants. \"BMD-2\" was used to signify the basic initial combat vehicles while \"BMD-2K\" designated command vehicles with additional communications equipment. The BMD-2 was then modernized to become the \"BMD-2M\" mark which introduced support for smoke grenade dischargers on the turret sides. Beyond that, the BMD-2 production run saw little changes from the original fielding. Operators of the BMD-2 (beyond Russia/Soviet Union) went on to include India, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Russia today remains the largest operator of the type with hundreds still in service and over 1,000 in mothballs.\n\r\nDuring development of the BMD-2, another version was being drawn up to fit the full-size, complete version of the BMP-2 turret. This model became the \"BMD-3\" of 1990 (detailed elsewhere on this site). The designation of \"BMD\" stands for \"Boyevaya Mashina Desanta\" which translates into \"Combat Vehicle Airborne\".\n\r\nNATO designated the BMD-2 as the \"BMD M1981/1\"\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMD-2 (Boyevaya Mashina Desanta)", "vehicle_type": "Airborne Amphibious Light Tank / Infantry Fighting Vehicle"}, {"id": "07315962-8f7d-4d6b-9d8c-46d83f8650d5", "year_model": "1985", "description": "\r\n        \tAside from the M1 Abrams, perhaps no other American armored vehicle has represented the American Army more than the venerable Humvee series of four-wheeled vehicles. Since its inception, the Humvee has become a staple of military operations both globally and domestic. The type's straight-faced appearance, wide-stance and utilitarian functionality have endeared her to a once-suspect military community and a public always ready for the next new thing in off-road capability. The Humvee today represents the pinnacle evolution of the war time Jeep, with an origin indirectly dating back to the smallish 50-60 horsepower machines that were once the standard mode of transportation to our serving grandfathers.\n\r\nIn February of 1981, the US Army set forth a requirement for a new tactical four-wheel drive light vehicle to take on the designation of High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and be capable of delivery to any given location on the battlefield via helicopter. The Army had found a tremendous amount of success with its World War 2-era series of small jeeps but the vehicle was still a design with its roots dug well into another time. Beyond that, it had experimented by militarizing civilian trucks for the same role but these conversions left much to be desired. As such, the HMMWV specification called for a universal solution to the Army's needs, one that would also peak interest from the United States Air Force and the United States Marine Corps equally. A multi-role product with commonality of parts and ease of conversion to other roles was now the call of the day. US Army requirements were high - perhaps a bit too ambitious - but the need was quite desperate.\n\r\nBy July of that year, the US Army had invited AM General, Chrysler Defense and Teledyne Continental to a prototype face-off, each required to build no fewer than eleven vehicles utilizing a common chassis but with conversions showcasing the type's possible multi-faceted use in the field. Prototypes would include a TOW-capable system, an unarmored base vehicle and a hardtop battlefield ambulance. The program was known as the XM998. Testing began in April of 1982 with AM General's design winning out. \n\r\nInterestingly enough, AM General owed its origins to the Willys-Overland Company responsible for the World War 2-era \"Jeep\". Willys-Overland was purchased by Kaiser in 1953, becoming Kaiser-Jeep Corporation before indirectly evolving into AM General Corporation. American Motors Corporation purchased Kaiser-Jeep in 1970 and branched AM General as a subsidiary. Jeep Corporation now remained as a separate entity. During all this time, the companies were still fulfilling US Army needs and production of military trucks was their forte. Eventually, AM General was purchased out once again, this time by LTV Corporation in 1983. By 2004, AM General was now brought under ownership of the Renco Group.\n\r\nAM General submitted a conventional four-wheel drive system with a forward-mounted diesel engine mated to an automatic transmission, a large passenger cabin and good off-road capabilities. AM General secured the Army's favor in their new system following the agreement of a $1.2 billion dollar contract on March 22nd, 1983, calling for the production and delivery of 55,000 total HMMWV examples. Additional USAF, USN and USMC orders brought the total closer to 70,000 examples.\n\r\nThe HMMWV development was sped along in order to enforce the ranks of the US Army. As such, the system appeared with some notable deficiencies when put through the rigors of military use. Maintenance for early HMMWVs proved a bear for Army mechanics and inherent reliability of these early vehicles left much to be desired. As such, efforts were made in part by the General Accounting Office to curtail the massive production contract awarded to AM General. The US Senate did just that on June 14th, 1984, which essentially forced the US Army to place the HMMWV design into further testing and evaluation. AM General managed to address several major and minor issues during this time and testing by the US Army, US Navy and US Marine Corps all helped to solidify the HMMWV as ready for production. The HMMWV entered service with the US Army in 1985.\n\r\nThe HMMWV was first fielded in anger in the 1989 US Invasion of Panama during Operation Just Cause (the operation also signified the introduction of Lockheed's F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter) in an effort to unseat dictator Manuel Noriega. Operational results for the type proved excellent as a whole, showcasing reliability and good performance under the rigors of wartime use.\n\r\nThe HMMWV eventually took on the A0, A1 and A2 generational designations (A0 appeared retroactively after A1 was beginning its usage in US Army terminology). A0 represented the original production Humvees, these fitted with a 6.2 liter, 150 horsepower, liquid-cooled V-8 diesel engines. The engines were mated to a General Motors THM400 automatic transmission system featuring all-wheel drive capability. In all, the A0 family of variants comprised of the M998, M1038, M1037, M1042, M996, M997, M1035, M966, M1036, M1045, M1046, M1025, M1026, M1043 and M1044. A heavy-duty version of the A0 soon appeared in September of 1992 as the M1097 HHV (Heavy Hummer Variant). This new vehicle provided for an improvement to capabilities over the original A0 model thus expanding the products reach.  \n\r\nThe A1 appeared in 1994 with revised front seats, grille and rifle mounts and was essentially developed from the M1097 HHV. These vehicles took on the designation of M998A1. The A1 family was comprised of the M998A1, M1038A1, M1097A1, M996A1, M997A1, M1035A1, M966A1, M1045A1, M1025A1, M1026A1, M1043A1 and the M1044A1.\n\r\nThe A2 was another much-improved Humvee with origins in the M998A1. A new 160 horsepower, 6.5 liter diesel engine was mated to a digital four-speed automatic transmission. Rear seats were redesigned as was the heater and steering column. A2's also had provision for the CTIS (Central Tire Inflation System) to be added as an option in the field. This on-the-fly adjustability provided for direct operator control in maneuvering the Humvee through the most unforgiving off-road terrain imaginable. The A2 variant line is made up of the M1097A2 (three versions of this model - base, mover and shelter carrier), M1123A2, M997A2, M1035A2, M1025A2, M1043A2 and the M1045A2.\n\r\nThe Expanded Capacity Variant (ECV) proved another successful development of the A2 line. These machines sported a new 6.5 liter turbo-diesel engine of 190 horsepower with increased cargo-hauling capacity. Other variants have since come online including the unarmored shelter carrier M1113 and the \"up-armored\" and air-conditioned M1114. The M1116 is similar to the latter and is fielded with USAF base security personnel. The M1151 is an armament-carrier model while the M1152 is a cargo or troop hauler. These two are based on the ECV Humvee. In all, the ECH line is comprised of the M113, M1114, M1116, M1151 and the M1152.\n\r\nArmament carrier Humvees perhaps remain the most interesting of the family line to the casual observer. The most pronounced is likely the TOW-carrying Humvee now featuring the TOW-2B anti-tank missile system used by both the US Army and the USMC. TOW missiles have an impressive tendency to fly straight at altitude before sharply climbing up and dropping down to strike armored vehicles at their thinnest, and therefore, weakest point - their roof.  TOW-carrying Humvees can also be equipped with the armament mounting kit consisting of a weapon ring fitting atop the Humvee cabin roof. This position can therefore accept a variety of crew-served weapons such as the Browning M2HB .50 caliber air-cooled machine gun, the Mk 19 Mod 3 40mm automatic air-cooled grenade launcher, the 7.62mm M60 General Purpose Machine Gun and the 7.62mm M240 General Purpose Machine Gun. night sights are available.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "HMMWV (High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle) / (Humvee)", "vehicle_type": "4x4 High-Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle"}, {"id": "fc3f3bea-8f47-4958-8c81-fa74477d0c6b", "year_model": "1985", "description": "\r\n        \tBeyond maintaining land-based silos and a fleet of ballistic missile launching submarines, the Russian Army also maintains a squadron (Strategic Missile Troops) of mobile ballistic missile launcher vehicles through the RT-2PM \"Topol\" design, known to NATO as the SS-25 \"Sickle\". These massive vehicles were introduced in 1985 and are in active use with the modern Russian Army.\n\r\nThe missile component began development in July of 1977 as an improved version of an InterContinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) able to reach any part of the world. It would be adopted to succeed an aging line of previous ICBM models then in inventory with the Soviet Army. By the middle of the 1980s, the missile had entered the requisite test stages and service introduction occurred that same year. Improvements made to the line followed into the 1990s to keep the weapon system a viable component of the modern battlefield.\n\r\nThe missile component carries the name of \"Topol\". it weighs some 99,400lb and has a length of 97 feet with a diameter of nearly 6 feet. The warhead is a single 800 kiloton fitting and the rocket motor a three-stage solid-fueled rocket engine. Range of the missile is out to 6,200 miles and the rocket can reach speeds of Mach 21 (16,000mph). An inertial autonomous guidance system guides the rocket along its course.\n\r\nThe carrier component of the Topol is the MZKT-79221 series ultra-heavy-duty trucks. These massive machines offer the strength and drive power needed in carrying the large ballistic missile to and fro. The vehicle's design is notable because of the multi-wheeled arrangement, seating eight axles with two-wheeled pairings each. The vehicle acts as the transporter erector launcher for the Topol missile and is a successor to the earlier MAZ-7917 vehicles, themselves having succeeded the MAZ-547 trucks of old. The operating crew is housed in a split forward cab at the front of the truck which overhangs the forward-most axle. The Topol missile itself overhangs the cab.\n\r\nThe Russian Army fields over 350 Topol missiles currently (2017). Modifications and modernizations to the system have continued. The Topol series is in service with the 35th Rocket Division stationed at Barnaul and this group maintains some 36 mobile launchers - though as many as 100 are thought to be on hand by Western observers.\n\r\nThe RT-2PM2 \"Topol-M\" is the latest incarnation of the mobile Topol system and is known to NATO as SS-27 \"Sickle B\".\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SS-25 / SS-27 / RT-2PM (Sickle / Topol)", "vehicle_type": "Mobile InterContinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Carrier"}, {"id": "1aaa2007-49d0-4875-aed6-6901b5f4e9d1", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet Union introduced the concept of the Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) with the adoption of its BMP-1 in 1966.

This eventually became the \"BMP-2\" family of tracked armored vehicles.\n\r\nThe \"BMP\" name is derived from the Russian \"Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty\" which, when translated, becomes \"Infantry Combat Vehicle\".\n\r\nThe IFV concept emerged with the Soviet plan to introduce a vehicle that offered performance suitable for fast-moving mechanized forces, protection and troop-carrying capabilities of an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) with the firepower of a light tank. This endeavor inevitably produced the BMP-1.\n\r\nWhile successful at its core, the BMP-1 offered some notable inherent limitations on the ever-evolving battlefield. It was, for all intents and purposes, designed for fighting across the European battlescape. First combat actions were in Arab hands against Israeli forces during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and results were not promising when many fell to large-caliber machine gun fire and small caliber artillery systems. When pressed into service across the dry, hot and rugged terrain of Afghanistan against non-conventional forces wielding RPGs (Rocket Propelled Grenades), the design proved vulnerable in several key areas. \n\r\nThe base armament of 73mm cannon with onboard support for a 1st Generation anti-tank missile was surpassed by counters emerging in the West. The 73mm cannon itself proved particularly inaccurate at the required engagement ranges. The AT-3 \"Sagger\", designed as a wire-guided anti-tank missile, required the operator to be exposed out of the turret roof when guiding the missile to its target. Other limitations including the internal arrangement which sat the commander directly behind the driver in the hull. Not only did this limit his tactical vantage point of the situation ahead, a single direct hit from an enemy projectile could kill both crew - rendering the vehicle a complete loss. The internal passenger seating arrangement was also of note as the twin back-to-back benches were set about the fuel stores fitted in-between, this proving an obvious hazard to passengers and crew alike. Similarly, the ammunition stowed about the hull was exposed and could explode if taken a direct hit.\n\r\nWhile a modernization program produced the improved BMP-1P, the endeavor was an interim design pending the arrival of a new type. This begat work on such a product in 1972, a direct successor as the aptly-designated \"BMP-2\". \n\r\nThe new BMP-2 held a form and function that remained largely faithful to the original save for a few key qualities which instantly set it apart for the better. The hull was shortened and widened for a new internal arrangement and minimized side profile along the horizon. The driver remained at the front-left of the hull with the powerpack to his immediate right. The commander, however, was moved from his hull placement to the new two-man turret, joining the gunner. This arrangement now provided a better communications arrangement between gunner and commander. The passenger cabin was reworked and reduced to include space for only six infantry (down from the original's eight seating) while the twin doors (opening outward) at the rear hull face allowed for infantry entry/exit as normal. An additional infantryman was stationed behind the driver in the commander's old position. Passengers, once again, sat across two benches fitted back to back with access to firing ports that contained periscopes for aiming. Four firing ports were allotted to the left hull side with three along the right which allowed passengers to defend the vehicle with personal weapons as necessary. Night vision equipment remained standard for all three crew positions and NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection was required on the nuclear-driven Cold War battlefield. The BMP-2 retained the former's all-amphibious approach though improved such qualities through a sharper prow at front and lengthened deflector at rear with propulsion based on the motion of the moving tracks so no dedicated waterjet was required. However, prior to water entry, the vehicle required the crew to erect a trim vane and turn on bilge pumps as in the BMP-1. Unlike early production BMP-1 vehicles, which relied on an internal exhaust-based smoke generation system, the BMP-2 was fielded complete with 6 x electrically-operated smoke grenade dischargers (three per turret front side) while retaining the engine-based system as well. Armor protection was 33mm at the thickest, mostly along the critical frontal facings though the armor protection scheme as a whole was reportedly improved based on actions in the Middle East and Afghanistan.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMP-2 (Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty)", "vehicle_type": "Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV)"}, {"id": "2ff3d02e-d1be-4d35-a2dd-99b0952cf650", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe DT-30 (Vityaz) is a lightly-armored, tracked, multi-purpose battlefield vehicle originating from the Soviet Cold War era and continues to provide service with the Russian Army today. Design work on the vehicle began in 1971 which led to serial production models coming off the Ishimbai Transport Machine-Building Plant assembly lines by 1982. The near-60-ton design offers excellent off-road mobility and undertakes heavy-cargo carrier roles for the service.\n\r\nThe vehicle was born out of a Soviet need in the 1960s for increased mobility, particularly as a war against the West in Europe was all but inevitable - requiring the mammoth Soviet Army to cut across the European landscape in short order. What was needed was a heavy hauler to carry across these landscapes heavier loads than what was currently being offered by in-service systems of same function. The result was the oversized Vityaz with its wide beam, low ground pressure, and articulated rear section to relatively easily move cargo from Point A to Point B.\n\r\nState trials involving the prototype vehicles DT-LP and DT-L then followed, resulting in the DT-30 articulated vehicle being approved for widespread production and service. What the Soviet Army received was a product capable of operating in extreme weather conditions and on soft terrain, making it ideal for operations in the Arctic, Antarctica, and the unforgiving northern territories of the vast Soviet expanse. Even the Oil and Gas industry went on to benefit from this rugged \"go-anywhere\" vehicle.\n\r\nStructurally, dimensions include a running length of 45 feet, a width of 9.2 feet, and a height of 8.10 feet. All-welded construction makes up the hull. Inside there is a standard operating crew of two and the engine sits behind the crew compartment, the powerplant being a 12-cylinder engine coupled to a manual transmission system. Externally, each track side features six road wheels and the drive sprocket sits at front with the track idler at rear. The rear hull component also mimics this track-an-wheel arrangement for consistency. Access to the cabin is through hinged, automobile-style doors and the short hull nose offers an elevated, commanding view of the terrain ahead - viewed through three rectangular window panes each having their own windshield wiper. Headlamps are positioned over the cabin and at the front of the hull for low-light/night time driving. Ground clearance is excellent making the vehicle ideal for cross-country/uneven terrain travel and even amphibious crossings. The forward unit can operate even if the rear component has failed. The DT-10P variant weighs in at 31 tons while the DT-30 is a hefty 58 tons.\n\r\nNo defensive armament as the DT-30 is essentially a logistics support vehicle - though personal weapons can be carried by the crew. The distinct design of the hull also provides some (light) protection against hidden mines and IEDs.\n\r\nSlovakia is the only other known operator of the DT-30 series and this is strictly through their Fire and Rescue Corps.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "DT-30 Vityaz", "vehicle_type": "Articulated Tracked Utility Vehicle"}, {"id": "72d26fa5-bfdb-41f0-a9d2-ca1658a3e941", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2K22 \"Tunguska\" (NATO codename of SA-19 \"Grisom\") is a self-propelled, tracked air defense system that combines both rapid-fire automatic cannon power and surface-to-air missile capability. The targeting system relies on a radar sensor with fire control handled via IFF (Identification Friend or Foe). All of the primary tracking and engagement facilities are fitted to a traversing turret allowing for a base 360-degree arc of fire with elevation/depression at +80/-6 respectively. The vehicle is crewed by four personnel and powered by a V-46-4 turbocharged V12 water-cooled diesel engine outputting 780 horsepower. The Tunguska was developed and produced by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau between 1970 and 1980. Entering production in 1976, the Tunguska is in active service with a few forces as of this writing (2013).\n\r\nAs a tracked vehicle, the 2K22 has the inherent capability of moving off road as part of a mobile mechanized formation thanks to its engine fitting and hydropneumatic suspension system. The Tunguska features a top road speed of 40 miles per hour with an operational road range of 310 miles. The chassis can clear 1 meter obstacles.\n\r\nPrimary armament is 8 x missile launch tubes and this is supplemented by 2 x 30mm 2A38M cannons supported through 1,904 projectiles aboard. Missile support includes the 9M311, 9M311K, 9M311-1 or 9M113-M1 series missiles.\n\r\nThe type has since been produced in a handful of notable variants beginning with the 2K22 of 1982. The definitive production model then became the 2K22M of 1986 which was fielded on a GM-352M chassis. This was followed by the improved 2K22M1 of 1988 which was built upon the GM-5975 chassis and utilized a longer-range missile (9M311-M1) of 10 kilometers coupled to a modernized fire control system (FCS). The ultimate evolution of the Tunguska system is the 2K22M which features an all-new FCS and longer-range missile support (18 kilometers).\n\r\nThe 2K22 Tunguska will eventually be replaced in full within the inventory of the Russian military by the modern \"Pantsir-S1\" 8x8 wheeled anti-aircraft weapon system.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-19 (Grisom) / 2K22 Tunguska", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Air Defense System"}, {"id": "df185dd8-4b39-4c52-aeac-23ec7c3a2833", "year_model": "1981", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 2S9 \"Nona\" (\"Newest Ordnance Ground Artillery\") was introduced with Soviet Army forces in 1981 as a self-propelled, tracked, light armored artillery mortar vehicle. Design work began in the mid-to-late 1970s and resulted in the requisite trials period and subsequent serial production spanning from 1979 to 1989. The vehicle maintains an active status in the modern Russian Army and has found homes in the inventories of several global armies worldwide. Production has reached at least 1,000 units.\n\r\nAt the heart of the 2S9 is its 120mm 2A60 heavy field mortar which is fitted to a powered, traversing turret set atop the hull of the BTR-D. The BTR-D was introduced in 1974 as a lightweight airborne multirole tracked platform. With its compact dimensions and light-class weight, the vehicle proved an air-transportable system and could serve typically lightly-armed units behind enemy lines. The 2S9 is a 9.6-ton vehicle powered y a 5D20 series, V8, water-cooled, diesel-fueled engine of 240 horsepower mounted in the rear. Road speeds reach 37 miles per hour with an operational range out to 310 miles. Cross-country travel is aided by the torsion bar suspension system. Armor protection for the crew of four is up to 15mm at its thickest. Some 40 to 60 120mm mortar rounds are carried for the primary weapon while local defense is through a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun. Six smoke grenade dischargers allow for self-screening actions.\n\r\nLike other Soviet-era vehicles of this class, the hull is fully amphibious and propelled through use of twin waterjets located at the lower rear of the hull. This continues the long-accepted Soviet doctrine of assault through all possible avenues in regards to armored warfare. Amphibious qualities are not always part of the makeup of Western armored vehicles.\n\r\nAs a mortar-carrying weapon, the 2S9 has the ability to engage target areas through indirect fire, lobbing its explosive shells over enemy defenses. The turret has its own elevation span which enables various angles of fire to be reached while the crew operates in a protected environment - albeit slightly cramped. Dimensions of the vehicle include a running length of 6 meters with a width of 2.6 meters and a height of 2.3 meters. It sports a low profile which, coupled to its inherently compact size, makes for a harder target to effectively engage at range along the horizon. Various mortar shell types also broaden the tactical reach of the vehicle in action beyond the standard HE (High-Explosive) types - smoke and illumination shells are noted.\n\r\nOperators of the 2S9 went beyond the old Soviet guard. This has included Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela. Russia maintains a fleet of about 275 vehicles including those based on the BTR-80 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) as the \"Nona-SVK\".\n\r\nA towed version of the 120mm gun system is recognized as the \"Nona-K\".\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S9 Nona", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Artillery (SPA)"}, {"id": "7a84c8e1-8f8f-4416-a882-8acc3cd76be7", "year_model": "1980", "description": "Hagglunds (BAe Systems) - Sweden", "vehicle_name": "Hagglunds Bandvagn 206 (Bv 206 Viking)", "vehicle_type": "All-Terrain Tracked Multi-Role Vehicle"}, {"id": "96f4aa26-a0d0-48e1-b907-9b2890405c45", "year_model": "1979", "description": "\r\n        \tThe vast airspace over the Russian frontier and the combat-ready atmosphere of the Cold War required the Soviet Army to keep large collections of mobile surface to air missile platforms on hand. To further its reach, these systems were often times sold overseas to allied nations or satellite parties within the Soviet sphere of influence - intended to create all manner of headaches for Western warplanners, primarily the Americans. In 1970, the Soviet Army ushered in the SA-6 \"Gainful\" tracked mobile missile-based anti-aircraft system to counter low-to-medium flying threats - principally low-flying aircraft and helicopters. In the early 1970s, however, thought was already being given to complementing the existing system with a more advanced type capable of engaging all manner of threats at medium altitudes including cruise missiles. In 1972, Soviet government commissioned for such a system and its design would serve both land- and sea-based assets - the former in its basic tracked form and the latter in launcher only.\n\r\nOne of the key design detriments of the SA-6 Gainful series was multiple launchers reliant on a single fire control radar. The new missile system would, therefore, feature its own integrated fire control radar for improved tactical value. The 9M38 \"Buk\" missile was designed for placement atop a tracked chassis containing six double-tired road wheels to a track side with a rear-mounted drive sprocket. The completed system would sport a 360-degree traversing launch platform (with powered elevation) mounting 4 x 9M38 missiles.\n\r\nThe new missile system was evaluated during a period spanning 1977 into 1979 to which limited examples made their way into Soviet Army service in time until the system was formally cleared for service in 1980 (designated as the \"9K37-1 Buk-1\"). The requisite navalized variant became the 3S-90 \"Uragan\" and this followed in 1983. Recognition by NATO observers in the West produced the SA-11 \"Gadfly\" designation.\n\r\nThe complete systems package was designed around the 9M38 missile (later the 9M317 missile) which was powered by a solid propellant rocket motor. It sported an operational range out to 20 miles with a defended airspace up to 46,000 feet. The missile relied upon a semi-active radar homing guidance suite and detonated through a radar-based proximity fuse utilizing a fragmentation-high-explosive warhead in the nose cone. Stabilization fins were noted along the missile sides. Overall weight of individual missiles was 700kg. Each missile sported a running length of 5.55 meters. The benefit of such a system was its capability to be fired from various launch platforms not limited to a mobile, land-based vehicle. As such, fixed and naval variants could be developed from the basic design.\n\r\nBy 1983, the 9K37 family was modernized which subsequently led to development and acceptance of and improved missile with improved radar and further protection from enemy jamming signals intended to disrupt the service. The Soviet Army formally adopted this version in 1983 and an export mark then followed. Another modernization effort introduced an improved missile type - the 9M317 - that saw acceptance in 1998 and forced NATO to create the all-new SA-17 \"Grizzly\" designation to differentiate the two major production types. The Grizzly had the capability to track and intercept ballistic missiles in-air so range, accuracy and power were all improved. The land-based variant also ushered in an equivalent navalized form. A new missile with advanced capabilities was introduced in 2007. A vertical launch unit has also been developed.\n\r\n9K37 weapons were credited with the downing of at least four Georgian aerial drones during the fighting between Russia and Georgia during the South Ossetia War of 2008. Conversely, Georgian 9K37 systems downed four Russian aircraft in turn. During the conflict, the 9K37 proved its value to a very good extent. Despite its 1970s origins, the modernized forms could still keep pace with more modern aircraft and their respective countermeasures.\n\r\nBelarus and China have both produced localized copies of the Soviet/Russian 9K37 missile defense family. Both have been modernized in their own respective ways to keep them viable on the modern battlefield. Global operators of the Soviet/Russian design proper have included Belarus, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, Georgia (by way of Ukraine), North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, and Venezuela.

It was a budget alternative to more technology-laden programs of the period and therefore somewhat limited in terms of overall engagement capabilities. It lacked all-weather functionality though its more direct operator participation (it is optically-aimed and guided) made its engagement of aerial targets far less prone to jamming and evasion. Development work began in 1969 by KB Tochmash Design Bureau of Precision Engineering to which the 9K35 was taken into service in 1979. To NATO, the vehicle was known as the SA-13 \"Gopher\". It continues to see use today (2014), having been taken on by forces ranging from Afghanistan and Angola to Ukraine and Vietnam. Former operators include Czechoslovakia (dissolution), Poland, Slovakia, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia (dissolution). Modern Russian Army versions use a new missile.\n\r\nThe 13.55-ton SA-13 is built atop the existing hull and chassis of a slightly modified MT-LB multipurpose armored tracked carrier and therefore retains the same YaMZ-238 V diesel-fueled 240 horsepower engine and performance specifications of 37 miles per hour road speeds and 310 mile operational ranges. A torsion bar suspension allows for the necessary off-road capability and the hull is amphibious as in the original MT-LB, treading water at a 3-mile-per-hour-clip. Its crew numbers three - commander, driver, and gunner and armor protection is only against small arms fire, measuring 7mm thick. Primary armament is its four-shot 9M333 missile launcher which sits atop the hull on a trainable mount. The launchers are grouped as two pairs of launchers in a side-by-side format, the pairing separated by the radar array at center. The mounting hardware features full traversal and elevation controls. The launcher can also fire the older missiles of the Streal-1 family.\n\r\nThe original missile was the 9M31M of 1971 which used an impact and proximity fuse. This was followed by the 9M37 of 1976 and its proximity and impact fuse. Then came the 9M37M of 1981 and the 9M333 of 1989 - the latter introducing an eight-ray laser proximity and impact fuse. Maximum range has been progressively increased over the lifespan of the missile's evolution while minimum intercept altitudes have been steadily increased.\n\r\nOver the decades, the Strela-10 system has been continually improved to help expand its battlefield usefulness. This has produced the Strela-10M, Strela,10M2, and Strela-10M3 marks.

The system was in active production from 1979 until 1987 from the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant and saw adoption by the forces of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Ukraine and the Soviet Union during its period of service. Ukraine and the Soviet Union are the remaining active users of the missile system today (2017).\n\r\nThe OTR-23 was developed to replace the aging line of SS-1 \"SCUD\" battlefield missile delivery systems that proved quite popular with Third World armies and saw much exposure during the Gulf War of 1991 in the hands of Iraq. Since the threat of nuclear war was still a large part of Cold War actions / reactions, the OTR-23 was given inherent nuclear-delivery capabilities. The system improved on range and firepower when compared to the outgoing SCUD series and would be used as a \"first-strike\" component against critical NATO targets and infrastructure when called upon. The mobility of the OTR-23 vehicle allowed it to be repositioned in short order and make it a hard target to locate and destroy by NATO airborne forces.

The S-300 missile was developed by MKB from the period beginning in 1967 and entered Soviet military service in 1978. Consistent modernization programs have kept the S-300 series a viable battlefield instrument which, coupled to its powerful radar system, has let it remain a potent anti-aircraft defender despite its Cold War root. An export-minded version has also ensured its place among many global operators (mostly those with Soviet Cold war-era roots). The S-300 is comparable in its battlefield qualities and scope to the American MIM-104 \"Patriot\" battery and is now competing with designs such as the Chinese HQ-9 system recently adopted by Turkey over the Russian product.\n\r\nThe S-300 missiles are generally fielded through multiple-cell launchers which are fitted horizontally atop heavy industry trucks for mobility. The typical photographed transporter is an 8-wheeled vehicle with front-mounted engine and driving cabin offset to the left side of the chassis. The vehicle is deployed with its own dedicated radar vehicle to provide the scanning and tracking prowess required.

This destructive value is not lost on ground commanders either for the vehicle has been used to demolish standing structures that can house enemy elements.\n\r\nDespite its Cold War roots, the UR-77 continues to serve an active role in the modern Russian Army.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "UR-77 (Meterorit)", "vehicle_type": "Mine Clearing Vehicle"}, {"id": "65d23431-f51f-4d9c-900a-7863fb4a7884", "year_model": "1977", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 9P148 \"Konkurs\", also incorrectly identified by some as the \"BRDM-3\", is a variant of the base BRDM-2 Amphibious Scout Car series appearing in 1962, developed to replace the BRDM-1. The BRDM-2 series proved itself quite an adaptable and capable battlefield system since its inception and went on to see service beyond the Soviet Union with some 40 countries worldwide - many continuing its operation even today. The Konkurs derivative is mechanically similar to the base BRDM-2 vehicle and only differentiated by its mounting of the Konkurs (NATO: \"Spandrel\") anti-tank missile launcher atop the hull. The end-product is, therefore, a highly mobile, cross-country, anti-tank support vehicle that can reconnoiter terrain, report enemy positions and defend itself against enemy armor.\n\r\nOutwardly, the 9P148 highly mimics the original BRDM-2 Scout Car as it retains the rather utilitarian appearance of the original including its four wheel 4x4-power layout, slab lower hull and angled upper hull facings. It also retains the four auxiliary wheels that can be lowered at the center of the vehicle sides. Various vision ports allow the crew of two or three personnel sighting opportunities from the relative safety of the vehicle. Multiple access hatches allow for entry/exit of the vehicle. The boat-like front hull is purposefully designed as the 9P148 - like the base BRDM-2 before it - is fully amphibious, propelled through water by a propeller system buried at the rear facing of the lower hull.\n\r\nConcerning the support for the Konkurs missile, the 9P148 sports a five-launcher rail for the 9M113 Konkurs series wire-guided, anti-tank missile system (NATO: AT-5 \"Spandrel\"). The 135mm missile was introduced in 1974 to provide Soviet anti-tank teams a counter to NATO armor in-the-field. The missile packed a tandem HEAT (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank) warhead coupled with a solid-fueled rocket booster while detonation was by way of direct force contact. With an effective range of 2.5 miles, the Spandrel could reach out to enemy tanks at distance with good penetration results. As a wire-guided weapon, however, the operator could only control the missile (via thrust vectoring) during flight so long as the data wire attached to missile and launcher had not been severed. Sighting was accomplished by way of a device installation mounted along the front right of the upper hull. The launching system was specifically designed to be retractable and rest along the turret roof during transport while also decreasing the vehicle's side profile. The crew could launch all five missiles from within the protective hull or remotely by way of a relay cable, the crew positioned up to 80 meters away from the vehicle. Reloading was, however, managed externally from the onboard supply of missiles and as many as 14 could be carried. The crew reloaded the launcher rails through a hatch located aft of the launcher itself.\n\r\nIt is worth noting that early production 9P148 forms were restricted to firing only the 9M113 Konkurs series missile but the system has since evolved to support the 9M111 \"Fagot\" (NATO: AT-4 \"Spigot\") as well. Modernization to the 9P148 series has brought about the installation of a \"whip\" aerial communications antenna  as well as newer sighting devices relying the latest available technologies for much improved day and night support.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BRDM-2 / 9P148 (Spandrel / Konkurs)", "vehicle_type": "Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) Carrier / Armored Scout Car"}, {"id": "0e057c2e-4434-4b27-a7df-ed8fcfd90dd5", "year_model": "1977", "description": "Ural Automotive Plant - Russia", "vehicle_name": "Ural-43206", "vehicle_type": "4x4 Light Cargo Military Truck"}, {"id": "f779888e-bc07-4518-973c-0e49cfe06837", "year_model": "1976", "description": "\r\n        \tSoviet armored doctrine was wholly rewritten during World War 2 (1939-1945) following the German invasion of the Soviet Union through \"Operation Barbarossa\". A large focus was eventually placed upon mobile artillery support that involved rocket fire (\"Katyusha\" systems) with towed artillery elements and, beyond that, Self-Propelled Gun (SPG) units. This wartime experience considerably influenced designs that would appear after the war which saw \"big-gunned\" vehicles become the norm in supporting major offensives. The 2S7 \"Pion\" (Peony\") was taken into inventory in 1976 and its design was centered around a massive 203mm gun barrel which sat atop a tracked chassis. Despite its Cold War roots, this effective fire support vehicle remains in service to this day (2015).\n\r\nWhen recognized by the West, NATO assigned the designation of \"M1975\" (\"Model 1975\") to the 2S7. It carried the official Soviet Army designation of \"SO-203\" as well. When adopted by the service, the 2S7 became the largest Self-Propelled Artillery (SPA) vehicle in service anywhere in the world.\n\r\nWith the arrival of the T-80 Main Battle Tank (MBT), the Soviet Army had an all-modern track-and-wheel chassis from which to spawn a line of associated vehicles from. The 2S7 was developed to support offensive actions involving tanks as well as infantry and other mobile assets for frontline service involving indirect fire. The 2S7 became a 46.5-ton vehicle mating the 203mm 2A44 series howitzer atop the T-80 tank chassis which utilized a V-46-I V-12 turbocharged diesel-fueled engine of 840 horsepower and was fitted at the middle of the hull. The vehicle component retained its torsion bar suspension system for off-road travel and could reach speeds of 31 miles per hour with an operational road range out to 400 miles. Overall length was 10.5 meters with a width of 3.38 meters and a height of 3 meters. Armor protection was for only the crew held in the hull (in a forward-mounted cab sporting roof hatches) and measured 10mm in maximum thickness.\n\r\nThe standard operating crew numbered fourteen (seven were carried on the primary vehicle with the remainder brought along in an assist vehicle) though only the driving and command positions located at the front cabin were wholly protected. This meant that the gunnery grew was completely exposed at the rear-top of the hull and also at the mercy of the elements and nuclear/biological/chemical warfare.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S7 Pion / Malka (M1975)", "vehicle_type": "203mm Tracked Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH)"}, {"id": "6f39070a-eb77-4c47-8e87-2cfed9170320", "year_model": "1976", "description": "\r\n        \tWorld War 2 (1939-1945) finally brought to bear the power and lethality of in-direct missile strikes from one nation against another primarily through Germany's V-1/V-2 programs. In the post-war decades, the Soviets - already familiar with the inherent power of amassed formations of rocket projectors against its German foe - undertook considerable effort to bring about a plethora of missile/rocket-projecting solutions to bring to bear against the West should the Cold War ever have \"gone hot\". One of these creations, the OTR-21 \"Tochka\" (GRAU designation of \"9K79\", known to NATO as the SS-21 \"Scarab\") appeared in its original form in 1976.\n\r\nThis weapon, a 6x6 wheeled tactical ballistic missile launcher, has seen extensive combat service since, covering the clashes of the Yemeni Civil Wars (1994 and 2015), the First (1994-1996) and Second (2000-2009) Chechen wars, the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present), the War in Donbass (2014-Present), the Saudi involvement in Yemen (2015-Present), the Nagomo-Karabakh Conflict (2020), and the Russian invasion of neighboring Ukraine (2022).\n\r\nThe advancement of missiles led to larger, more powerful solutions that offered greater accuracy than that of carpeting an entire target area with rockets while still retaining the inherently terrifying psychological value. In-direct fire allows a launcher source to arc its lethal payload, from range, and rain down onto enemy positions or fixed targets, giving a tactical edge to the attacker in this scenario. The prospect of a wheeled delivery vehicle means that the system can be relocated to another firing location once resupplied with a fresh missile - however, this requires the commitment of accompanying resupply vehicles and additional support staff for optimal performance on the battlefield.\n\r\nSeries production of OTR-21 vehicles began in 1973 under the KBM (Kolomna) brand label followed by Soviet deployment of the mobile launchers in 1981 to East Germany. These were used to succeed an aging line of 9K52 \"Luna-M\" rocket projectors which arrived back in 1964.\n\r\nThe complete OTR-21 system involves a lightly-armored, all-wheel 6x6 military truck chassis capable of on-road / off-road travel seating a single missile launcher unit over the rear hull. The vehicle portion of the system is the 9P129. The rocket component - seated on the BAZ-5921 Mobile TEL launcher - is a single-stage, solid-fueled weapon with variable operational range depending on the production variant. These missiles reach speeds of Mach 5.3 and are guided to the target by inertial guidance systems (the \"Tochka-R\" version since added passive radar support to better engage radar-emitting installations).\n\r\nThe \"Scarab-A\" was the initial missile development of 1975 and could be used with High-Explosive (HE), FRAGmentation (FRAG), and nuclear warheads. These missiles featured an engagement range of about 43 miles but suffered from accuracy issues (error probability of less-than 490 feet). The \"Scarab-B\" (\"Tochka-U\") improved error probability accuracy by about 200 feet to less than 315 feet and range was enhanced to 75 miles. These missiles came online in 1989 after years of testing. B-models were then followed by the improved 'Scarab-C\" in the 1990s. Range was enhanced to 115 miles and error probability lowered to 230 feet - making for a much useful vehicle.\n\r\nMany former Soviet allies have since given up use of the OTR-21 system including Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic/Czechia), Poland, and Slovakia. However, the missile still remains in play for the forces of Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Syria, Kazakhstan, Yemen, and others. Russian Army versions have been succeeded by the 9K720 \"Iskander\" series in time.\n\r\nThe OTR-21 has seen active use in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine as Ukraine still fields it in number.

The type was a further evolution of the T-64 line with elements of the successful T-72 added for promising measure. The end result, the first production tank to utilize a gas turbine engine, proved a limited success with numbers never reaching those of its predecessor nor the overtly popular T-72. While still in active service today (2012), the days of the T-80 as a frontline battlefield solution are coming to an end as its available numbers are continually reduced with each passing year. The T-90 (based on the T-72) maintains the primary position in the modern Russian Army, leaving the T-80 as something of an interim solution at best,  a measure serving to bridge the gap between the expired Soviet-era T-64 and modern Russian Federation T-90.\n\r\nIn 1963, the Red Army began use of the T-64 Main Battle Tank which formed the spearhead of Soviet armor strength during the critical years of the Cold War. The T-64 incorporated an automatic loader coupled to a 125mm smoothbore main gun capable of firing guided anti-tank missiles. Its arrival certainly forced the West to take notice as it represented the most modern Red Army tank of the time. The T-72 was then developed in short order as a simpler, economical counterpart to the T-64, though it ended up surpassing the T-64 in both numbers and world popularity (some 25,000 T-72 tanks were produced to the 13,000 T-64s). Soviet tank doctrine called for both tank types to serve concurrently and allowed for financial flexibility in the long term. As the T-64 was considered something of a \"state secret\" in terms of its technology and capabilities, it was not openly exported as the T-72 was.\n\r\nAs such, the T-64 remained the principle high-tech Soviet Main Battle Tank to lead the Red Army onto victory in the event of total war across Europe. In the late 1960s, thought was already being given to a new design built upon the inherent strengths of the T-64. Many developmental tank designs had been in play since the close of World War 2 (1939-1945) for the Soviets and many of these went on to lay the foundation of Soviet tank technologies to come. Such developments began to refine a gas turbine engine that would one day be used in powering an armored vehicle though tank engineers would have to wait for technology to catch up with the desire.\n\r\nObject 288 was a tank testbed fitted with 2 x GTD-350 series aircraft turbine engines outputting at 690 horsepower. A second design, Object 219 SP1, utilized a single GTD-1000T multi-fuel gas turbine installation and this was able to output at 1,000 horsepower. After extensive testing of various chassis configurations, the Object 219 SP1 was modified into the refined Object 219 SP2 and it was this prototype that formed the basis of the \"T-80\". Design of the T-80 would span from 1967 until 1975 to which then serial production was ordered and the vehicle entered service in 1976 following the requisite army trials. Production of T-80s would last until 1992 to which 5,404 units would be delivered from LKZ and Omsk Transmash in Russia and Malyshev in the Ukraine. The gas turbine powerplant allowed for greater power over that of traditional diesel-fueled types at the expense of fuel consumption, general reliability and overall cost.\n\r\nIn keeping with Soviet tank design traditions, the T-80 managed a very low profile, exceptional inherent maneuverability and fielded a smoothbore main gun. The use of an autoloader in the turret reduced the traditional operating crew from four to three personnel to be made up of the driver (in the hull) and the commander and gunner (in the turret). The autoloader also allowed for a dimensionally shallower turret design and lighter overall weight. The tank's overall configuration was conventional with the engine at rear, the turret at center and the driver in front. The running gear of the T-80 consisted of six double-tired road wheels to a track side with the drive sprocket at the rear and the track idler at front. The upper track regions were protected over in side skirt armor. General armor protection is steel and composite which can be enhanced through add-on reactive armor blocks. Portions of the T-72's torsion bar suspension system was carried over into the T-80 which allowed for excellent inherent mobility for a vehicle of this weight class.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-80 (MBT)", "vehicle_type": "Main Battle Tank"}, {"id": "9b337751-2770-468b-9002-a85e83a57ad1", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tBeginning in the late 1960s, the Soviet engineers began design and development of a new 152mm towed field gun. Following the requisite trials in the early1970s, the weapon was formally adopted for service as the 2A36 \"Giatsint-B\" in 1975. Today, it remains an active inventory portion of several  operators including Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland (as the \"152 K 89\"), Georgia, Moldova, Iraq, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. Production of the 2A36 spanned from 1975 into 1989 by the Perm Automobile Factory SKV and the same gun also makes up the main armament of the 2S5 \"Giatsint-S\" self-propelled gun (SPG) platform.\n\r\nThe 2A36 is largely of a conventional design as towed artillery pieces go. It features a four-wheeled, rubber-tired carriage useful for transporting the massive gun by mover vehicle. The carriage also features a split-trail arrangement that doubles as the recoil \"legs\" when the gun sits in its emplacement (for firing). The rifled barrel is of single piece construction featuring a multi-slotted muzzle brake at its business end and an integrated recoil mechanism down at the mounting. The weapon utilizes a semi-automatic breech block action when loading/reloading with hydraulic power used in elevation, this spanning from -2 to +57 degrees to serve in both the direct- and indirect-fire role as needed. Traverse is limited to -25 to +25 degrees to either side. As a system, the 2A36 weighs a hefty 21,500lb and showcases a length of 40 feet when set up to fire. The carriage provides a wide of 7 feet, 8 inches.\n\r\nFiring a 152.4mm cartridge (charges are loaded separate), the 2A36 can make use of a variety of projectile types including conventional HE (High-Explosive), Anti-Tank (AT), nuclear, submunitions and a rocket-assisted shell which dramatically improves realistic effective ranges. Shells exit the muzzle at up to 3,100 feet per second with listed ranges for conventional ammunition out to 19 miles. Rocket-assisted projectiles gain a range out to 25 miles. The artillery piece relies on an operating crew of eight made up of a group leader, ammunition handlers and gun layers.\n\r\nDespite their Cold War-era origins, 2A36 operators have moved ahead with modernization programs to help keep their guns viable on today's battlefield.

It still maintains an active presence in the Russian Army inventory and has seen noted combat actions in Afghanistan (1979-1989) and Chechnya (1999-2009). The Soviet designation was consistent with the accepted practice of an alpha-numeric system (\"2S4\") and the association to a flower (\"Tyulpan\").\n\r\nThe Red Army witnessed the value of large-caliber mortar systems first-hand in World War 2. The Soviets therefore fielded a large collection of field mortars ranging from infantry level types to massive 240mm caliber monsters in their fight against the Germans. By the end of the war, the large-caliber mortar had managed a permanent foothold in the Red Army inventory and little was to change with the upcoming Cold War against the West. Development of a self-propelled and modern mortar carrier began in 1960.\n\r\nOverall, the 2S4 is a rather utilitarian weapon system consistent with Soviet armor doctrine - \"quick production and a big gun\". The vehicle is assigned an operating crew of up to nine personnel making up both vehicle and mortar gunnery elements. The vehicle portion of the 2S4 is nothing more than a modified chassis of the GMZ-class minelayer complete with a torsion bar suspension system for adequate off road travel capabilities in keeping up with the main armored force. The hull contains the engine, transmission and driver position with the driver is seated front left. Power is supplied by a single V-59 series diesel engine developing 520 horsepower output. As a tracked vehicle, the 2S4 makes use of six double-tired road wheels to a track side along with a drive sprocket at the front of the hull and a track idler at the rear.

The hull superstructure is multi-faceted and rather low-set against the lower hull portion of the vehicle.

The Soviet Union relied heavily on the inherent firepower of \"rocket projectors\" throughout World War 2 (through their heavy use of \"Katyusha\" systems) in staving off defeat at the hands of Hitler's Germany and inevitably carried this tactical doctrine into the Cold War years against the West. Rocket projectors held the uncanny ability to provide area suppression while delivering powerful psychological effects on enemy troops unlucky enough to be found within its \"reach\". Such rocket systems could saturate a target area ahead of the main advancing force made up of combat tanks, armored vehicles and infantry elements.\n\r\nDeveloped in the 1970s, the BM-27 was formally inducted into Red Army service in the latter portion of the decade. The large 8x8 wheeled vehicle mounted no fewer than 16 x 220mm rockets which it could launch at targets some 22 miles away. The chassis was nothing more than a modified development of the ZiL-135 series 8x8 wheeled truck and completed with an armored cab for the crew. The massive vehicle was powered by a pair of gasoline-fueled engines installed in a side-by-side arrangement. Each wheel, therefore, drove the wheels along its respective side of the chassis allowing for full 8x8 support. The wheels were arranged in a rather unique way with the front and rear axles set well apart from the inner second and third axles. Consequently, only the front and rear axles became steerable in the design. The BM-27 system maintained an operation road range of up to 311 miles, less so when traversing over uneven terrain over long distances.

In 1974, the service adopted the BTR-D for its airborne troops, an air-droppable, fully-amphibious tracked Armored Personnel Carrier (APC). Design work spanned from 1970 until 1974 and serial production followed.\n\r\nThe series still maintains an active presence in the inventory of Russian airborne elements today (2017).

Operators beyond the Red Army included various satellite nations, communist allies and Soviet-friendly nations the world over. The initial 2S1 prototype was completed in 1969 and the type entered service with the Red Army sometime in the early 1970s. Once in operational service, the 2S1 was available in large numbers.\n\r\nThe Soviet Army gained much valuable experience in their dealings with the capable German Army in World War 2. In the decades following, a commitment to ever-improving army support was key to the might of the Soviet land army. Such systems in development became large caliber mortars, field guns, main battle tanks and self-propelled artillery. The advent of the missile age also helped to expand the lethal reach of Soviet military hardware and its weapons were shipped off to any pro-Soviet regime. The 2S1 self-propelled howitzer was one such implement that utilized proven mechanical components with a powerful main gun. Its howitzer nature ensured that it would have been used in support of Soviet troop and armor actions should the Cold War in Europe had ever turned \"hot\".\n\r\nThe 2S1 borrows much of its design from the MT-LB multi-role tracked vehicle. The hull is rather long and featureless, making room for the flat, all-welded turret emplacement to which a 122mm, double-baffled main gun is fitted. This provides the 2S1 with a low profile and squat appearance, making her easy to conceal and more difficult to identify.

Power is generally derived from gasoline engines developing about 120 horsepower each, allowing for ideal road speeds of up to 80 kilometers per hour.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BTR-70", "vehicle_type": "8x8 Wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "b7c415ec-e297-463c-9c0c-d1db582915c4", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tTo contend with ever-improving, more agile low-altitude aircraft emerging from the West during the Cold War, the Soviet military developed and ultimately adopted the 9K33 \"Osa\" (\"Wasp\") self-propelled, wheeled, amphibious Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) vehicle. It was designated \"SA-8\" and codenamed \"Gecko\" by NATO once its existence was verified. Design work by the NII-20 Research Institute spanned from 1965 into the early 1970s to which the system began formal service in 1971 (continuing today - 2014). The SA-8 has proven a combat veteran, seeing action in the Lebanon Civil War (1982), the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002), the Persian Gulf War (1991), the South Ossetia War (2008), the Libyan Civil War (2011), and the Syrian Civil War (2011-present). It is estimated that some 1,200 units have been produced with several notable variants having appeared.\n\r\nThe 19-ton system features a vehicle section with a running length of 9 meters, width of 2.75 meters and a height of 4.2 meters. It's typical operating crew is five. The vehicle consists of a lightly-armored hull form atop a 6x6 wheeled chassis. The chassis supports cross-country travel while the hull is cleared for amphibious crossings which then played well into established Soviet ground warfare doctrine (forged largely by actions in World War 2 some decades earlier). The vehicle featured a D20K300 diesel-fueled engine of 300 horsepower output which provided driving ranges out to 500 kilometers and road speeds nearing 80 kmh. In water, the vehicle managed a pedestrian 8 kmh. The driving compartment lay at front in the usual way with the launcher component was sat over the rear of the vehicle, the radar element affixed over the frontal center mass. The six road wheels, three to a hull side, were large and well-spaced for good balance while the overall hull shape was quite shallow, presenting a smaller target along the horizon. The powered launcher component fitted two groups of three short-range missile launch tubes (for a total of six missiles) in a side-by-side arrangement - the launchers separated at center the radar component.\n\r\nThe missile series of choice became the \"9M33\" mark, a weapon weighing 170 kilograms with a length over 10 feet. Its diameter was 210mm while the warhead held a High-Explosive, FRAGmentation (HI-FRAG) payload with contact and proximity detonation. Propulsion was through a solid-propellant rocket booster aided by a guidance system with dual-thrust rocket steering for fine corrections. The missile reached an altitude of 39,000 feet and range over 9 miles with speeds over 1,000 meters per second.\n\r\nAs with other Soviet-sponsored weapon systems of the Cold War, the SA-8 found its way into the inventories of many Soviet-supported states, nations, and allies. This list included Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia (later the Czech Republic), East Germany (some sold to Greece post-reunification), Ecuador, Georgia, Greece (from Germany), India, Jordan, Libya, Poland, Romania, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Kuwait also fielded the type and many were captured in the 1990 Iraq invasion - now falling to the Iraqi defense inventory. Czechoslovakian models were absorbed into the new Czech Republic defense network but eventually phased out during 2006. Similarly, Soviet SA-8s were absorbed into the new Russian Army but these were modernized to contend with newer aerial threats - about 400 or so may still be in the active inventory. Belarus, Poland, and Jordan versions have followed suit and completed local modernizations to combat emerging regional threats.\n\r\nVarious official marks have resulting from the SA-8's lengthy, still-ongoing service career. 9K33 - the designation assigned the original incarnation by the Soviets - was the model of 1972 and designated SA-8A by NATO. The 9K33M was a navalized version and known to NATO as SA-N-4. In 1975, a new missile was used on the 9K33M2 and designated by NATO as SA-8B \"Gecko Mod-0\". The 9K33M3 then appeared in 1980 with upgraded missiles and improved engagement ranges to which NATO marked it as SA-8B \"Gecko Mod-1\". Export versions were known under the local name of \"Romb\". The 9K33-1T is a Belarusian upgrade. The Osa-AKM-P1 is a Polish approach.\n\r\nLatest active use of this SAM vehicle has been in the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011 as an offshoot of the Arab Spring from the 2010 revolutions.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-8 (Gecko) / 9K33 OSA", "vehicle_type": "6x6 Wheeled Self-Propelled SAM Vehicle"}, {"id": "1574756f-c9f0-4912-9a22-af6fee94be97", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviets/Russians have always maintained a penchant for successful (and globally popular) tank designs since they unveiled their war-winning  T-34 Medium Tank during World War 2. The T-34 began a long-running history of capable, cost-effective combat machines designed to match - or in some cases surpass - available Western offerings. The Cold War-era T-72 proved no exception, granted with excellent speed for its class and an inherent reliability that is always require by the modern battlefield. Perhaps most important to procurement authorities, the T-72 was a budget-conscious end-product which could be produced in the tens of thousands during a period when every effort was being made to stay one step ahead of the United States and Europe in comparable developments. As such, the T-72 has gone on to see an extended service life in many foreign inventories and has undoubtedly proven an export success. With over 25,000 examples delivered, the T-72 ranks only second to the most successful post-World War 2 tank - the T-54/T-55 (with as many as 100,000 being built). In comparison, the wartime T-34 saw 84,000 units produced.\n\r\nThe T-72 originated as a design to counter the expensive nature of the technologically-advanced T-64 of 1963. The T-64 was the primary spearhead Soviet Main Battle Tank and introduced the D-81T 125mm smoothbore main gun. To this point, Western offerings relied on a rifled 105mm system and have since gone on to adopt a 120mm smoothbore design themselves. The T-64 also coupled the 125mm main gun with an automatic loader which reduced the crew size to three and contained overall operational weights to manageable levels while promoting a reduced profile on the horizon. The T-64B was the first Soviet tank line to support firing guided anti-tank missiles from the main gun barrel which broadened its tactical value considerably. However, its procurement costs proved limited and only 13,000 T-64 tanks were produced from 1951 to 1962 from plants originating in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n\r\nThe prototype T-72 was born as the \"Object 172\" which evolved into the modified \"Object 172M\". Evaluations of this new vehicle were undertaken in 1971 and concluded the tank to be functional and capable, leading to its adoption as the \"T-72\" for the Red Army. Serial production began that same year, quickly replacing the T-55 and T-62 in production, and formal deliveries occurred the following. The T-72 was first unveiled to the public in the 1977 \"May Day\" parade and, amazingly, would retain its frontline status until the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991.\n\r\nExternally, the T-72 followed the tried-and-true doctrine of decades-long Soviet tank design. Much attention was always given to a very low profile from any angle and the addition of an autoloading mechanism lessened the turret crew to two personnel with the driver in the front-center of the hull (Western tanks generally utilize manual loading which required a fourth crewmember, a third person in the turret). The autoloading feature was devised as a carousel-type arrangement containing the charge in an upper rung and the projectile in a lower rung, brought together at the breech. The gunner could then respond to the commander's load and fire orders by electronically selecting the appropriate projectile and readying the main gun in this fashion. The commander's cupola was offset to the right of the turret roof and came complete with vision blocks. A integrated dozer blade was affixed to the underside of the bow to help plough tank obstacles or fill in anti-tank ditches with earth or sand.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-72 (Ural)", "vehicle_type": "Main Battle Tank (MBT)"}, {"id": "ae7c477c-8903-4ec5-93ed-3d78125e9bb7", "year_model": "1971", "description": "\r\n        \tTo match the capabilities of the United States Army and its introduction of the 155mm-armed M109 SPA (Self-Propelled Artillery), the Soviet Union took to development of a similar-minded system of 152mm (152.4mm) caliber in the 2S3 \"Akatsiya\" (\"Acacia\"). The Soviet vehicle, designated as the \"M1973\" in American nomenclature, began its development during 1968 to which manufacture was directed by Uraltransmash and production spanned from 1967 to 1993. Several major forms ultimately emerged including all-modernized versions to keep the system a viable artillery piece. The 2S3 has since gone on to see considerable battlefield activity and proven itself on more than one occasion through its accuracy and mechanical reliability. As such, many remain as frontline use today (2014), primarily with former Soviet states and global allies.\n\r\nThe heart of the 2S3 is its D-series L/27 main gun based on the D-20 army howitzer. Typically, a single vehicle carried 40 to 46 projectiles in a mixed arrangement to include HE-FRAG (High-Explosive, FRAGmentation), HEAT-FS (High-Explosive, Anti-Tank, Fin-Stabilized), Armor-Piercing, Tungsten (AP-T), smoke and illumination projectiles. The main gun is affixed to a turret allowing for full 360-degree traversal to be achieved. The mounting also gives an elevation range of -4 to +60 degrees. Loading is through a semi-automatic, vertical wedge breech with a rate-of-fire reaching four rounds per minute. Conventional shells range out to 11.5 miles while Rocket-Assisted Projectiles (RAPs) can reach out to 15 miles. Secondary armament (optional) included a remote-controlled 7.62mm PKT machine gun to which 1,500 x 7.62mm rounds were carried.\n\r\nThe 2S3 is typically fielded with a crew of six made up of the driver, vehicle commander, gunner, loader and a pair of ammunition handlers though some versions are seen with a crew of four. Armor protection ranges from 15mm to 30mm, the thickest sections along the front of the hull and turret.\n\r\nThe vehicle's drivetrain includes a V-59 series 12-cylinder, water-cooled, diesel-fueled engine developing 520 horsepower at 2,000rpm. This is mated to a planetary gearbox. The running gear (track-over-wheel arrangement) showcases six double-tired road wheels to a hull side, the drive sprocket at front and the track idler at rear. The hull sits atop an independent torsion bar suspension system with hydraulic shock absorbers found at the first and sixth wheel pairings. Performance specifications include a maximum road speed of 40 miles per hour.\n\r\nOriginal 2S3 vehicles were designated simply as \"2S3\" and these saw production from 1970 to 1975. The 2S3M mark followed as a modernized version and introduced a slightly revised hatch arrangement as well as increased internal stowage for more 152mm projectiles among other features. The main gun was updated to support laser-guided, RAPs and production spanned from 1975 to 1987. The 2S3M1, which was produced from 1987 to 1993, marked a new 2S3 standard when introduced, given a new sighting device and additional equipment to improve battlefield support and awareness. Earlier 2S3 and 2S3M marks were eventually updated to this standard. The 2S3M2 of 2000 became another further modernized mark and introduced use of an automatic Fire Control System (FCS) as well as externally-mounted smoke grenade dischargers and a satellite-based navigation system. This mark has been exported under the 2S3M2-155 designation. The 2SM3 is a known developmental 2S3 mark incorporating a new FCS and new howitzer gun, more in line with that as found on the modern 2S19 Msta SPA. As such, it can share the same ammunition clearances.\n\r\nOperators of the 2S3 have proven plentiful with many still showcasing the system as frontline weapon. Beyond the obvious Russian Army connection (which absorbed thousands of the ex-Soviet Army stock), the vehicle has been taken on by the armies of Azerbaijan, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Belarus, Cuba, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Libya, Russia, Slovakia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Former operators include Bulgaria, East Germany and Iraq. The United States Army gained access to four examples from Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall and an additional three were gained in dealings with the Ukrainian government following the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\r\nThe Russian Army maintains about 930 active 2S3 systems in its inventory with a further 1,600 believed to be held in storage. It is also used by the Russian Marines.\n\r\nThe 2S3 has become a truly battle-tested weapon system, first used in anger during the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan (1979-1989). It was then pressed into action during the Tajikistan Civil War (1992-1997) and used during both of the Chechen Wars (1994-1996, 1999). In the 2008 South Ossetia War, the 2S3 was again in play with good results. Foreign forces have dutifully showcased their 2S3s in turn, as in the 2011 Libyan Civil War and the ongoing Syrian Civil War, also originating in 2011.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "2S3 Akatsiya (SO-152) / (M1973)", "vehicle_type": "152mm Self-Propelled Artillery (SPA)"}, {"id": "998abdfa-3f4a-48cb-8a23-2ab1f6cf5013", "year_model": "1970", "description": "\r\n        \tThe M-240 is a Soviet Cold War-era smoothbore, heavy-class, vehicle-towed infantry mortar of 240mm caliber.

The weapon has been in service globally since the early-1970s and continues to be found on modern battlefields as a secondary solution.\n\r\nThe complete system utilizes a single-axle, twin-wheeled suspended carriage that features its own anchor / counter balance, sighting device, and elevation gear. The mounting hardware allows the barrel to take a \"muzzle-up\" stance when ready-to-fire and traversal of the gun tube is 18-degrees from centerline with an elevation span of +45 to +65 degrees. Due to the size and weight of the weapon and its ammunition, a crew of eleven personnel are required for optimal results. This still restricts the system to a rate-of-fire of just one projectile per minute.\n\r\nThe weapon is cleared to fire a variety of battlefield projectile types including High-Explosive (HE), High-Explosive (3F2 \"Gagara\"), FRAGmentation (HE-FRAG) (3O8 \"Nerpa\"), nuclear (3B11), and incendiary (\"Sayda\") types.

After successfully completing the requisite trials (delayed by various technological challenges), the design entered serial production in 1968 which ran until 1985. The system was formally introduced into limited Soviet Army service in 1967 before seeing widespread use by 1970 and operations concerning the unit continue with many nations even today - despite its 1970s heritage. The type has since seen successful combat actions through the Yom Kippur War, the Chad Civil War, the Iran-Iraq War, the 1st Lebanon War, the 1991 Gulf War and the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. To date at least 500 launcher units have been processed with some 10,000 missiles delivered. NATO recognized the 2K12 as the SA-6 \"Gainful\".\n\r\nDesign of the 2K12 is centered around the use of three rail-launched guided missiles utilizing an optical sight and continuous wave target illuminator. Missiles can detonate on impact or be set with a proximity fuze and hold an effective range of 15 miles against targets up to 45,930 feet in altitude. Each is powered by a solid fuel rocket motor and can reach speeds of up to Mach 2.8 which places any modern aircraft at risk. The system is categorized as a low-to-medium altitude interception device and its tracked nature assures that it can be relocated to any positions in defense of key installations. In its tracked form, the chassis makes use of six double-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear of the hull. The crew is entirely sealed in their armored vehicle while the traversing launcher - fitting the three missiles - sits atop the hull roof.\n\r\nThe 2K12 was modernized in 1973 to become the 2K12 Kub-M1. A further evolution of the system produced the improved 2K12 Kub-M3 of 1976. This was then followed by the 2K12 Kub-M4 in 1978 which was based on the 2K1 Kub-M3 and developed to work in conjunction with the newer 9K37 \"Buk\" anti-aircraft missile systems - which were inspired by the 2K12 family. The export version of the 2K12 became the 2K12E \"Kvadrat\" and these have since seen widespread use in Soviet/Russian-allied states and countries.

Airborne soldiers generally would have to pack lightly and this limited their tactical effectiveness once the enemy responded to surprise drops. One of the biggest threat to these lightly armed forces was the combat tank - airborne forces lacked much in the way of countering enemy armor. Some initiatives during the war ultimately succeeded but it would take the post-war environment to truly see endeavors fulfilled - the Soviet BMD series being one such implement.\n\r\nAfter World War 2, the Soviet Empire was a vast collection of nations and interests spanning the globe. Where security was to be enforced there was a requirement to field a quick-reaction force to any part of the world. One such element of the force ultimately became the Soviet paratrooper and to this end the airborne soldier needed a way of defeating enemy armor at range - firepower beyond that as offered by clumsy portable anti-tank weaponry. It was envisioned that a tracked vehicle, air-droppable by parachute, could be supplied to these fighting men when on the ground.\n\r\nThe Red Army had already committed to the BMP series of amphibious light tanks but, despite their \"light\" classification, proved too heavy for air dropping from Soviet transports. As such, a new tracked vehicle was designed in the image of the BMP and maintained the firepower and tracked qualities of her predecessor to help fulfill the Soviet Army need. The resulting design was known as the BMD with design work beginning in 1965 and production undertaken in 1968. Full scale production began in 1970. Comparatively the original BMP-1 was already in frontline service since 1966.\n\r\nThe BMD mimicked the sharp lines of the original BMP but was dimensionally smaller for obvious reasons. The hull was a boat-like design with a raised though sloped glacis plate leading up to the flat hull roof. The hull sides were vertical facings. A turret was located ahead of amidships with the engine to the rear. This forced the driver's compartment and fighting compartment to the front-middle of the design layout. The vehicle was propelled by five small road wheels to a track side. The drive sprocket was located at the rear with the track idler at the front. Four track return rollers guided the track about at the upper regions of the hull sides. Vision blocks allowed the fighting crew views of the outside action under relative protection of the vehicle. While the original BMP-1 weighed in at 13 tons, the BMD-1 was roughly half that value, coming in at 7.5 tons which made it air droppable per the Soviet Army requirement. The standard operating crew was four personnel to include the driver, commander, machine gunner and primary gunner with room for two passengers. The driver was located at the front center of the hull with the vehicle commander to his left and a dedicated machine gunner to his right. The primary gunner took a position in the turret. The vehicle measured a running length of 5.4 meters with a width of 2.5 meters, standing under 2 meters tall. Internal conditions were expectedly cramped for the tallest of soldiers. Armor protection was 33mm at its thickest though this mostly at the gun mantlet and construction was of cast magnesium alloy. The hull was suspended upon a hydraulic independent torsion bar suspension system for good cross-country traversal. The vehicle's ground clearance was adjustable by the driver.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMD-1 (Boyevaya Mashina Desanta)", "vehicle_type": "Airborne Amphibious Light Tank / Infantry Fighting Vehicle"}, {"id": "81ea0d46-bf34-4701-a7d5-afec422f65ba", "year_model": "1968", "description": "\r\n        \tWorld War 2 warfare instilled on the Soviet Army the need for a very mobile armored force. After the war, the concepts proven in battle were furthered to all new levels. During the Cold War years, a slew of armored vehicles emerged with various battlefield roles in mind and one of these creations became the MT-LB multirole tracked vehicle. Development began in the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West, to which the completed vehicle was adopted sometime in the latter part of the decade. Once identified by the West, the vehicle was designated in NATO nomenclature as the \"M1970\" (\"Model 1970\").\n\r\nThe MT-LB was developed as a direct replacement for the aged AT-P artillery tractor line. The design was largely formed from the work that also begat the successful PT-76 Amphibious Light Tank which was produced in over 12,000 examples. The initial product was the MT-L which then evolved to become the armored MT-LB. Production was assisted by the type utilizing many off-the-shelf components in circulation, and readily available, to the Soviet Army at the time. Manufacture was headed through the famous Kharkov tractor facility. The designation of \"MT-LB\" is born from the Russian translation describing \"Multi-Purpose, Light-Armored Towing Vehicle\".\n\r\nOne of the key qualities required of most any Soviet armored vehicle was amphibious support allowing the vehicle to cross moving water sources under its own power. The alternative was traversing bridges and similar checkpoints or arranging for engineers to construct a make-shift bridge over the span of hours and maybe days. The MT-LB was designed with this quality in mind, fully-amphibious, and propelled in the water by its own tracks, negating the need to activate a dedicated propulsion system.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "MT-LB (M1970)", "vehicle_type": "Multi-Purpose Tracked Vehicle"}, {"id": "046340f0-4481-4a7b-b07f-e8eefd950de8", "year_model": "1967", "description": "\r\n        \tBecause of advancements in Western aircraft regarding speed and operating altitudes, the Soviet Union was forced to remain on the cutting edge of air defense technology. Its defense network was eventually arranged to include a variety of short-, medium-, and long-ranged solutions to help counter the threat posed by high-flying bombers and spy aircraft. One of the entries into the long-range category became the classic S-200 missile - known to NATO as the SA-5 \"Gammon\" - and this series went on to see considerable adoption in the Cold War decades by a plethora of global operators beyond the Soviet Union. Design work on the S-200 is attributed to the Petr Grushin design bureau.\n\r\nThe Gammon series was introduced in 1967 and was featured in many of the notable conflicts of the 20th Century thereafter.\n\r\nThe SA-5 missile is directed primarily by way of the 5N62 series \"Square Pair\" radar which can track out to a distance of 170 miles (there are other available radar fits that can also be used). Several versions of the S-200 missile eventually appeared - the S-200A \"Angara\" is an original form of 1967 with 110 mile range followed by the S-200V \"Vega\" of 1970 with 150 mile range. The S-200 \"Vega\" increased range out to 190 miles and the S-200M \"Vega-M\" arrived as a modernized form. S-200E \"Vega-E\" was developed as the export-minded product form of the Gammon missile and S-200D \"Dubna\" arrived in 1976 as a nuclear-capable variant with 250 miles range.\n\r\nThe standard design of the missile itself consists of a tubular, highly aerodynamic shape with stabilization fins added. Each missile is fitted with four solid-fueled rocket booster units to help the missile reach engagement speeds as quickly as possible - offering little time for the target to react. The missile weighs in at 15,700 pounds and feature a nose-to-tail reach of 35 feet. The warhead is made up of a 478lb Fragmentation High-Explosive (Frag-HE) mix detonated either through proximity with the target or through command fusing. The rocket motor is a dual-thrust, liquid-fueled unit which, when coupled with the rocket boosters, allows the missile to reach speeds of 5,600 miles per hour up to altitudes of 130,000 feet out to 190 miles (range is variable and dependent  upon the missile model in play). Guidance is through a semi-active radar homing seeker installed in the missile's head.\n\r\nSince its inception, the SA-5 has proven its worth as a defensive-minded solution and deterrent. It is generally seen as accurate and its evolution from its original Cold War-era form has ensured it a place on the modern battlefield. Indeed both Russia and Iran are known to have undertaken more advanced forms of the missile. Current, notable operators of the SA-5 series includes Russia, Algeria, India, North Korea, Poland, Romania and Syria (among others). Former operators of the SA-5 system include many former Soviet allies like Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Georgia and Ukraine (among others). Gammon missile units were fielded in East Germany prior to German unification in 1990 as a deterrent to the West. In Russian service, six missile launcher units are assigned to a battalion and the current-generation missile in use is the S-200 \"Dubna\" type.\n\r\nAn SA-5 missile was responsible for the downing of a civilian Tupolev Tu-154.

The type incorporated a conventional track-and-wheel design with low-profile hull and turret fitting substantial armament designed to transport combat-ready infantry in relative (armored) safety while being able to bring its own anti-infantry/tank-killing firepower to bear. The vehicle was fast enough to compete with the main mechanized force as it advanced deeper into enemy-held territory and its amphibious capabilities allowed it to traverse off-road, poorly defended areas with due diligence, thusly overwhelming even a prepared enemy such as those expected to be encountered during the Cold War across the European battlescape. \n\r\nThe BMP-1 was primarily developed to replace the limited BTR-50 series vehicles (in particular the BTR-50P model) to which the much improved 8x8 wheeled BTR-60 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) was also developed in conjunction and produced on an equally large scale alongside the more technologically-laden BMP-1 family. Both vehicles went on to see considerable usage overseas and across countless conflicts dotting the Cold War decades. Despite having entered Soviet Army service in 1966, the BMP-1 was first identified by the West in November of 1967 and is now generally recognized as the first \"true\" Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV), classified as such due to its ability to transport troops, disembarking them and then being able to operate as a stand-alone armored fighting vehicle (AFV). Thusly the BMP-1 was something of a revolutionary hybrid design incorporating the best assets of a light-class tank with the benefits of an armored personnel carrier - essentially creating a new sub-class of armored vehicle. Contemporary Western counterparts have since gone on to include the American Bradley, British Warrior and German Marder.\n\r\nThe BMP-1 designation is born of the words \"Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty 1\" which translates to \"Infantry Fighting Vehicle 1\". Due to the limited nature of intelligence fielded by the West during the Cold War, the BMP-1 was initially recognized as the \"M1967\"before evolving into the \"BMP-1\" designation.\n\r\nDesign work on the BMP-1 series began in 1959-1960 through competition involving various concerns. The resulting winner became the \"Obyekt 764\" prototype which seemingly incorporated all of the design features sought by the Soviet Army (firepower, performance and protection). The first pilot vehicle was completed in 1964 and testing of more evolved models occurred into 1965 before the type was adopted in 1966 after having passed the requisite state trials.\n\r\nThe BMP-1 proved a departure from previous armored infantry carriers in that most early versions of such vehicle featured an open-air passenger cabin which exposed its infantry to all manner of battlefield dangers and environmental effects and hazards (namely the threat of nuclear war realistically persistent throughout the 1950s). The Soviet design incorporated a low-profile hull with extremely sloped glacis plate and basic operating crew of three (driver, gunner and commander). The engine was fitted to a front-right compartment to open the rear of the design for the passenger compartment and entry/exit through the unobstructed rear. The turret was set at center with unfettered views around the hull. The rear of the hull serviced eight infantry seated across two benches (four infantry per bench) facing outwards (fuel was stored between the two seat rows). The hull sides were given protected firing ports (four to a side) which allowed passengers the ability to help defend the vehicle through small arms fire from their own personal weapons (periscopes allowed for direct aiming though the ports themselves were not stabilized). Entry/access for the troops was through a pair of outward-opening hinged doors found at the rear face of the hull, each also sporting their own firing ports and aiming periscopes. The driver sat at the front-left in the hull with a personal hatch over his position and vision blocks for when the vehicle was \"buttoned down\". The turret maintained a hatch for the gunner while the commander resided in a special position just aft of the driver in the hull. As designed, and in keeping with common Soviet armored doctrine of the time, the BMP-1 was fully-amphibious and able to traverse open bodies of water with relative ease while being propelled about by the motion of its own tracks. Preparation consisted of raising a front-mounted trim vane and bilge pumps were turned on prior to any deep water entry. Water speeds totaled just 4.3 mph.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BMP-1 (Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty)", "vehicle_type": "Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) / Light Tank"}, {"id": "f0e4eb2e-bf1f-4a16-98a4-c796f7892675", "year_model": "1966", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BRDM-2 primarily served as an armored scout car with the Soviet Army during the height of the Cold War. She was a direct replacement to the limited BRDM-1 scout car series and, like many of the Soviet Cold War offerings, the newer BRDM-2 proved a cheap yet still capable system, making it a popular export product the world over. Thousands of examples were ultimately produced and the type was fielded in anger throughout several of the key global conflicts between the years 1960 and 2000. While she still serves with many nations across the globe (mostly Soviet-allied customers), the BRDM-2 now remains a limited product all her own when set on the modern battlefield. Regardless, she has proven herself a combat-capable system and has enjoyed the successes of her rather simplistic yet utterly reliable design.\n\nThe PT-76 Light Tank\n\r\nIn 1949, designs were on the boards for a new amphibious light tank to be used in the reconnaissance role for the Soviet Army. This design evolved into the PT-76 which entered service in August of 1952. The PT-76 lent itself well to the blossoming mobile army doctrine of the Soviets and allowed for unprecedented access to both land and water at speed. What the new system would need now is a comparable reconnaissance vehicle that could keep up with the inherent mobility of the new light tank - something which the current Soviet inventory found elusive in the available offerings. As such, the BRDM-1 scout car was born.\n\nThe BRDM-1\n\r\nThe BRDM-1 (originally as the \"BRDM\" before there was a \"BRDM-2\") was an initial scout car design that first appeared in the Soviet Army inventory in 1957 (design beginning in 1954). Of note was her 4x4 off-road capability and her amphibious quality, the former aided by a pair of powered belly wheels and the latter coming in the form of a rear-mounted water jet for propulsion. The engine was mounted in the front hull with the crew compartment set to the middle-rear. The BRDM-1 led a healthy existence, seeing over 10,000 examples produced and delivered to a large portion of Soviet allied nations in varied battlefield forms - she was adapted to carry a range of anti-tank missiles as well, improving her tactical usefulness to an extent. However, the BRDM-1 design was inherently limited at its core. She maintained no trainable turreted armament system (the gunner need expose himself to enemy fire to operate the external machine gun) nor was her crew protected from the effects of a nuclear war - prevalent in the Cold War years. Additionally, she was not given night vision equipment, making her a liability in such an environment. To add insult to injury, the BRDM-1 also lacked any sort of specialized reconnaissance-minded vision equipment - considering her role as a reconnaissance scout car, this was a wholly major drawback.\n\nThe BRDM-2\n\r\nAs such, it wasn't long before the BRDM-2 series of scout cars was born to \"right the wrongs\" of the previous design. The BRDM-2 first appeared in 1962 (a design credited to V.K. Rubtsov) and came online as a direct replacement for the BRDM-1. The BRDM-2 brought along with it several key improvements that made for a better system - including revisions and improvements to the amphibious capabilities, on-road/off-road performance and armament. Additionally, the BRDM-2 was fitted with NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection as well as night vision equipment.  The engine was moved to the rear of the hull with the crew compartment positioned to the middle-front. A powered turret was added to hold the armament and the powered belly wheels were retained. Production was handled by the Molotov GAZ Plant in Gorkiy, Russia. In all, some 7,200 examples went on to see production (from 1962 to 1989) and, at her usage height, some 40 nations fielded the BRDM-2. She proved a regular at Soviet pride parades during the Cold War and was publicly seen for the first time to Western observers in 1966.\n\nBRDM-2 Walk-Around\n\r\nIt is easy to dismiss the BRDM-2 based on looks alone for she maintains a rather utilitarian appearance with little to recommend herself. However, she is a capable wheeled system that has seen use the world over. The design is characterized by her four large road wheels offering full 4x4 support, these set on leaf springs with hydraulic shock absorbers. The wheels are spaced well apart, particularly when viewed in the side profile. Wheel wells are high-arcing and promote flexibility in steering while collecting and deflecting the mud and dust of the terrain. The lower hull is slab-sided along the sides and rear panels but sloped upwards along the front. The lower front hull angles up to the nearly-flat glacis plate. The glacis plate contours into the hull superstructure and allows a forward panel for vision ports afforded to the front-seated personnel. The sides of the superstructure are angled inwards towards the top. The design is capped by a rounded, low-profile, flat-topped, fully-enclosed turret structure that itself maintains relatively unfettered 360-degree rotation (these is only a communications antenna to the forward right-hand side of the design, near the commander's hatch). Headlamps are held at the forward extreme corners of the upper hull glacis plate and partially protected by armored rails. The driver makes use of external mirrors to view his immediate and distant surroundings. The forward armor vision panels can be raised and lowered at operator discretion. When raised, the glass-covered vision port (bulletproof) allows for improved forward visibility. Vision blocks for the crew are set at the upper access hatches as well as the sides of the hull superstructure while the commander and driver also have use of periscopes when the vehicle is fully \"buttoned down\". The engine is fitted to the rear of the hull unlike the BRDM-1. There is an integrated winch system built into the front hull of the BRDM-2 design as well as a central tire pressure system. The tire pressure system allows the driver to adapt one or all of his road wheels \"on-the-fly\" to the terrain ahead.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BRDM-2", "vehicle_type": "4x4 Wheeled Amphibious Light Armored Scout Car"}, {"id": "f797e56b-9da2-4c5e-a90d-2fe299b37959", "year_model": "1966", "description": "\r\n        \tThe natural progression of Soviet tank design during the years following World War 2 eventually produced the T-64 Main Battle Tank. The T-64 showcased qualities already having been proven in the war time T-34's successor - the T-54. The T-54 was evolved into the NBC-capable T-55 to which the T-62 was then created as a more advanced option. However, the T-62 failed to surpass the T-54/T-55 series in both combat exposure and sheer production numbers - totaling 22,000 examples to the original's grand estimation of 85,000 to 100,000 units produced. As such the T-55 was remained in production while the T-62 line was discontinued. The T-64, therefore, is what could be considered the Soviet Union's first true \"Main Battle Tank\" (as the M60 as was to the Americans). Development stemmed from the early 1950s until approximately 1962 to which the type was adopted for service in the Red Army with production beginning in 1963. Production would last until 1987 to which roughly 8,000 to 13,000 examples were delivered. However, the T-64 was never offered up formally for export sales thusly limiting its use to the Red Army. Operators eventually went on to include Moldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan - mainly due to the fall of the Soviet Empire and stationed Soviet Army tanks being passed on to successor host states. The arrival of the T-64 directly influenced the arrival of the improved American M60A3 production mark in response prior to the development of the failed MBT-70.\n\r\nThe T-64 was born of a prototype not unlike the T-54/55/62 series before it. There were many notable exceptions in its design to help differentiate it from the former examples. The five large road wheels consistent with earlier Soviet tanks were dropped in favor of six small road wheels to a track side. While the previous designs all lacked track return rollers, the T-64 prototype involved as many as four along the upper track region. The drive sprocket was now relocated to the rear of the hull with the track idler at the front. The hull was suspended by an effective and advanced torsion bar suspension system. The driver's position was now centered at the front hull as opposed to front left. The turret was largely reminiscent of the one featured on the T-62 and original armament was the same 115mm smoothbore main gun (the preceding T-62 design was the first combat tank anywhere in the world to showcase a smoothbore main gun). The T-64's gun was the D-68 (2A21 series) while a pair of snorkels could be erected prior to entering bodies of water for amphibious crossings. The ammunition count totaled 36 x 125mm projectiles and included APFSDS, HEAT-FARG and HE-FRAG types as needed. There was provision at the front hull for the adding of a mine clearing plow. Anti-infantry defense was handled by the 7.62mm PKT coaxial machine gun in the turret. To counter low-flying aerial threats, the crew managed a turret-roof-mounted 12.7mm NSVT series heavy machine gun. Standard NBC protection was afforded to the crew as was a fire extinguishing system. Armor protection ranged up to 450mm in thickness and involved a mix of glass, plastic and steel. Overall weight was roughly 42 short tons. An electro-hydraulic autoloader managed the reloading function of the main gun while reducing the crew to three personnel - the commander, driver and gunner. This not only saved on wait but increased internal volume and allowed for a smaller turret design and, thusly, shallower external profiles. As with the T-62, the T-64 incorporated two-axis stabilization of the main gun. Protection was afforded by the aforementioned composite armor designed to counter the new 105mm guns of Western tanks (explosive reactive armor blocks were eventually added in later T-64 production marks). \n\r\nThe engine of choice became the 5DTF 700 horsepower diesel system which dramatically improved performance (on road and off road) of the vehicle over that of the T-62. The engine was fueled through three internal fuel cells and boosted by the carrying of external, jettisonable drums at the hull rear. Operational range was 310 miles and road speeds peaked at 37.5 miles per hour.\n\r\nProduction of the T-64 series was ordered out of the Malyshev Factory at Kharkov, Ukraine, in October of 1963 and initial models were all armed with the stated 115mm smoothbore main gun system (lacking the thermal sleeve). Some 600 first-batch T-64 production models then appeared though the tank was not formally introduced into operational service until late 1966. The T-64 was not seen outside of Russian borders until it was deployed in East Germany in 1976 with the Guards Armored Division, Group of Soviet Forces. It was later deployed with Russian forces in Hungary.\n\r\nWhile production of the T-64 was ongoing, engineers worked on a revised form to better meet the demands of the modern battlefield. Key to this new development was the incorporation of the large 125mm D-81T series main gun attached to an autoloader (eight rounds per minute). The larger 125mm ammunition naturally took up more internal space than the 115mm projectiles but this was offset by the lack of a fourth crewmember. The suspension system was improved and side armor skirts were issued to protect the critical running gear from damage. Onboard stowage was increased due to the lack of internal space for the crew's personal affects. Later upgrades improved the fire control system (FCS), night vision capability and communications. The new production form came under the designation of \"T-64A\" while the requisite command tank version became the T-64AK. This version brought about additional communications equipment as well as an identifiable telescoping mast for the loss of the 12.7mm turret anti-aircraft machine gun.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-64", "vehicle_type": "Main Battle Tank (MBT)"}, {"id": "50eb556c-e170-4435-89dc-75400fef3b42", "year_model": "1965", "description": "\r\n        \tAt a time when tensions between East and West ran extremely high during the Cold War period (1947-1991) and another major war in Europe seemed all but inevitable, the Soviet Union invested heavily in frontline rocket-projecting weapons to stave off an attack. One such development of the period became the 8x8 wheeled 9K52 \"Luna-M\" battalion-level mobile battlefield rocket launcher carrying a single large rocket over the modified chassis of a ZiL-135LM military truck. The rocket was capable of unleashing conventional, chemical, and nuclear payloads at range, reaching speeds of Mach 3 in flight, and could \"touch\" targets as far out as 40 miles. The vehicle was initially developed (under the designation of \"3R-11\" and \"9R11\") as a nuclear-capable solution to deter any advanced from the West, mainly in and around East Germany, but were later converted to a conventionally-minded variant to better serve a Soviet frontline assault.\n\r\nThe vehicle was known to NATO as \"Frog-7\" and remains in limited use worldwide. In practice, it proved inaccurate, sensitive to weather/environment, and required a resupply vehicle on hand to replenish the single-shot rocket component. As such, it was eventually succeeded in the Soviet inventory by the more effective OTR-21 \"Tochka\" (NATO: SS-21 \"Scarab\") of 1976 detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nFirst-use of this battlefield system was by Syria in 1973 during the Yom Kipper War against Israel. They remained in inventory long enough to be used in today's long-running civil war by Syria.\n\r\nMajor rocket variants of the line included the nuclear-minded 9M21B, the conventional 9M21F (High-Explosive, FRAGmentation - HE-FRAG), and the chemical-capable 9M21Kh. The 9M21E offered cluster munition capability and the Laith-90 was the version used by Iraq in its wars against neighboring Iran and, later, the West. The PV-65 designation covered training systems.\n\r\nThe 9K52 series had a prolific reach for its time, utilized in conflicts ranging from the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) and Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) to the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present) and the Yemeni Civil War (2014-Present). Its reach was such that it is still found on some battlefields today.\n\r\nActive operators include former Soviet/Russian allied players such as Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Cuba, Egypt, Libya, North Korea, and Ukraine.

The effectiveness of the Shilka at low altitudes is a well documented story as the system has seen considerable action in several major global conflicts. The Shilka was initially reserved mainly for the Soviet Army and her (now former) supported states during the Cold War and went on to be exported heavily to ally nations in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. The Shilka defense system continues to serve in some impressive quantities with several armies around the world despite her 1960s-era origins. At the time of her inception, no anti-aircraft gunnery platform in the NATO inventory could match the lethality that was the ZSU-23-4 Shilka series.\n\r\nThe Shilka came about through a need by the Soviet Army to upgrade its existing self-propelled anti-aircraft gun capabilities. Her primary adversaries of the time were the United States and Great Britain and both were fully capable of fielding top-of-the-line ground attack aircraft including helicopters that would - in the event of all-out war in Europe - be called to limit the usefulness of Soviet armor. At the time, the primary system available to the Red Army was the ZSU-57-2 tracked series mounting a powerful set of 57mm cannons. However, despite this large-caliber armament, the system was inherently limited by its optically aimed tracking system, lack of integrated radar with no provision for engaging targets while \"on the move\". Onboard ammunition storage capability was also limited to just 300 rounds of 52mm projectiles.\n\r\nDevelopment on a replacement began in 1957 and continued into 1962. The new design - to become the ZSU-23-4 (otherwise known as the \"Shilka\" after the Shilka River found in Eastern Russia)  - incorporated the tracked chassis of the GM-575 with a flat, rounded turret system mounting 4 x 23mm rapid fire autocannons. A water-cooling system was fitted to keep the guns from overheating and at least 2,000 of 23mm ammunition could be carried aboard. A radar system (the RPK-2 \"Tobol\") was installed to aid the crew in the tracking and engagement of targets along the rear of the turret roof. The vehicle would be crewed by four personnel made up of a driver, commander, gunner and radar operator with the driver located at the forward portion of the hull and the rest of the crew in the turret. The turret was set at the middle of the hull roof with the engine mounted in a rear compartment. The vehicle utilized six rubber-tired road wheels with a long running set of tracks which gave good cross-country mobility in keeping up with Soviet armored formations. This effectively allowed  the weapon to be stationed just about anywhere a tank or similar wheeled vehicle could. The turret allowed for a full 360-degree traversal with extensive elevation that would let the crew engage both low-flying aerial targets as well as ground-based ones. Aerial targets could be engaged at 2.5 miles out while land-based ones at 1.5 miles. The radar itself could pick up targets as far out as 12 miles allowing the crew to be prepared to greet. Armor protection for the crew ranged from over 9mm on the turret to 15mm on the hull. Power was supplied from a V-6R series 6-cylinder, 4-stroke airless-injection water-cooled diesel engine developing 280 horsepower that allowed for speeds up to 50km/h on roads with a range out to 450km. The hull was seated on an individual torsion bar suspensions system with hydraulic shock absorbers fitted to several of the wheel pairings. Production by Mytishchi Engineering Works began in 1964 and continued on to 1982 to which some 6,500 examples were produced all. The ZSU-23-4 formally entered service in 1965 and over 38% of the production total went to serve in 23 countries around the globe.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "ZSU-23-4 (Shilka)", "vehicle_type": "Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun (SPAAG)"}, {"id": "a7da8cf4-c723-43e7-acc0-961c753d8979", "year_model": "1964", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BM-21 \"Grad\" is a specialty weapon utilized by over 65 countries in one form or another and, despite her Cold War origins, remains a viable and relatively inexpensive system even today. While the chassis and rocket technology have evolved over the years, the basic principle of delivering a large volley of directional explosives against a target area remains the heart and soul of the BM-21 system. The designation of \"BM-21\" comes about from \"Boyevaya Mashina\" (meaning \"combat vehicle\") while the rocket system (\"M-21\") provides the numeric designator. \"Grad\" is simply a nickname translating to \"hail\" as in \"hail storm\" which aptly describes the firepower of the BM-21.\n\r\nThe Soviets garnered much in the way of valuable experience during their use of mobile \"Katyusha\" rocket launching vehicles during World War 2, particularly after the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union through \"Operation Barbarossa\". These trucks could be built in large numbers in a short amount of time and just about any wheeled vehicle could be turned into a projector. When amassed, these rocket projecting systems could be used to target areas where enemy troops or soft-skinned vehicles were concentrated and deliver volleys of high-explosive lethality. While not wholly accurate, these weapon systems made up for their limitations through sheer firepower, a definite psychological weapon to say the least. As surely as World War 2 ended, the Soviet Army made it a point to continue development and production of similar rocket projecting platforms to fight within the scope of Soviet armor doctrine.\n\r\nThe original BM-21 was developed in the early 1960s and delivered into the army inventory by 1964. When formally identified by the West, the system was assigned the simple designation of \"M1964\". Collectively, the BM-21 consisted of the launch vehicle with the rocket projector system. The initial BM-21 Grad was based on the Ural-375D 6x6 truck chassis but has since been upgraded to the Ural-4320 6x6 truck chassis, this in 1976. In either form, the vehicle promotes high ground clearance and benefits from its all-wheel drive, 6-wheeled design with good cross-country ability.\n\r\nThe projector section of the weapon system is designated as the \"M-21 Field Rocket System\". The launch system itself is made up of 40 x 122mm launch tubes stacked horizontally in four rows of ten tubes. The tubes are connected to one another and swivel on a pivoting platform as a unit aft of the truck cab. This allows the BM-21 to engage target areas without having to reposition the entire launch vehicle. The crew cab is unarmored and therefore unprotected from the launch operation so extreme caution must be exercised by the crew. The launch tubes can loose their forty rockets away in just twenty seconds and the crew can set each to launch individually, segmented in firing groups or entirely as required. The BM-21 typically operates with a crew of four personnel though additional members make for shorter setup and turnaround times.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BM-21 (Grad)", "vehicle_type": "Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)"}, {"id": "d1a6b681-032f-454f-ba29-6863bea0e879", "year_model": "1964", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Bandvagn Bv 202 was a special military transport vehicle developed by Swedish-based Bolinder-Munktell (est. 1932) to a Swedish Army requirement calling for an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) with a troop-carrying capability. The series went into production during 1964 and this continued into 1981.

Designers were able to provide the vehicle with very low ground pressure in the finalized form, reducing the risk of the vehicle bogging down. Wide tracks also provided the frame in traversing various surface types. The overall design encompassed a forward and rear cab joined by a flexible center section. Running gear included five road wheels to a hull side for both the front and rear cabs. The operator managed control of the vehicle by way of a traditional steering wheel while hydraulic \"rams\" located between the two sections were used to \"bend\" the vehicle at its center to help drive it to the left or right. The front cab held the engine as well as the driver and vehicle commander while the aft-cab was used to transport up to eight combat-equipped infantry.

The gun mounting hardware sits atop a tripod base which also serves as the two-wheeled tow unit. Traversal is a full 360-degrees from centerline. Recoil is handled through a hydopneumatic system.\n\r\nAs with other artillery pieces, the D-30 is towed into action. For Russian (and related forces), the primary mover vehicle has been the tracked MT-LB or Ural-375 wheeled vehicle though many other haulers are possible replacement candidates. Design of the weapon system has been attributed to F.F. Petrov with manufacture through the Motovilikha Plant.\n\r\nSeveral variants have been manufactured beyond the original D-30 - which also carried the designator of \"2A18\". The weapon has been produced locally by China, Croatia, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia (Serbia), and Sudan resulting in various localized designations appearing. The Egyptian D-30-M model has been featured in the Egyptian Self-Propelled Gun (SPG) platform as the SPH-122 (American M109 howitzer chassis) and T-122 (Soviet T-34 tank chassis). \r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "D-30 / 2A18 (Model 1963)", "vehicle_type": "122mm Towed Field Howitzer"}, {"id": "ef07b73d-e6a5-44db-8232-c844b76f1691", "year_model": "1961", "description": "\r\n        \tWith more nimble and advanced aircraft emerging from the West during the Cold War decades, it fell to Soviet engineers to develop counters when protecting the vast airspace of the Soviet frontier. These sort of developments always began with a more capable missile to which an associated tracking and engagement suite was coupled. The completed unit could then be seated on any tracked or wheeled chassis capable of carrying the weapon's weight or affixed as a static emplacement to defend key Soviet installations or regions.\n\r\nIn 1961, adoption of the S-125 \"Neva\" (also \"Pehora\") occurred in the Soviet Army. Its design was attributed to engineer Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev  from the Almaz Central Design Bureau and intended as a bridge to the earlier S-25 \"Berkut\" missile series of 1955 and the high-altitude S-75 \"Dvina\" system of 1957. The S-125 went on to see combat service in the Yom Kippur War (1973), Angolan Civil War (1975-2002), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Gulf War (1991), and the Kosovo War (1998-1999). Its widespread acceptance in the inventories of many Soviet-supported states and allies has allowed it to remain a viable air-defense system even today (2014). Additionally, modernization programs have expanded its battlefield usefulness for some host nations.\n\r\nThe basic vehicle for the S-125 launcher was a 6x6 wheeled Soviet Army truck which utilized a standard automobile configuration with a front-mounted diesel-powered drive and a three-person cab. This arrangement typically saw two of the large missiles seated over the rear of the vehicle. The launcher held an inherent elevation range as well as traversal. Deployment was first seen around the capital city of Moscow beginning in 1961 and, in time, the Soviet Navy deployed a special over-water version. Further development begat a quadruple missile launcher developed to increase first-hit chances.\r\n\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "SA-3 (Goa) / S-125 Neva / Pechora", "vehicle_type": "Surface-to-Air Missile Defense System"}, {"id": "d74e485d-b0a2-4397-9f96-378fa9247325", "year_model": "1961", "description": "\r\n        \tAfter the end of World War 2, the Soviet military had officially replaced their war-winning T-34 Medium Tank series with the T-54 family. These were then upgraded with NBC protection and a slew of other features to become the T-55 series a short time later, intended to counter the new, interim American developments. Going beyond simply upgrading the T-55, work also began on a new tank design based on the same proven T-54/T-55 system though intended to house a more powerful 115mm main gun. To fit the new armament, the base T-55 had her hull lengthened and given an all-new turret assembly designed specifically for a high-velocity smoothbore 115mm main gun - the U-5TS (2A20 \"Rapira\"). This weapon was of particular note for it marked the first time a production combat tank had been given a \"smoothbore\" barrel - to this point, all combat tanks fielded a rifled barrel, the Soviet direction proving a major upgrade to the 105mm rifled main gun being fielded by the new American M60. The new Soviet tank was christened the \"T-62\" and production of the type resulted in deliveries occurring in July of 1961.\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes, the T-62 was more or less a further upgrade of the T-55 itself with the T-54 still serving as the \"true\" starting point for the family. As such, the type delivered roughly the same utilitarian appearance of its originator as well as the follow-up modification. The tank sported a low-profile design with a center-fitted turret emplacement. The glacis plate was very shallow and well-sloped for excellent point ballistics protection. The sides were dominated by the track system encompassing five road wheels to a hull side. The drive sprocket was held at the front with the track idler at the rear. Like the T-54 and T-55 before it, the T-62 lacked any track return rollers along the upper track region. The single diesel engine was held in a rear-set compartment and could generate its own smoke screen as needed. The turret was well-curved and squat in its general appearance, housing the 115mm U-5TS main gun armament as well as three of the four crew. The crew consisted of the driver in the front-left hull and the tank commander, gunner and loader in the turret/middle hull region. The turret was protected by up to 242mm of armor thickness along the front facing.  A pair of external fuel tanks could be fitted to the rear of the hull for improved ranges and jettisoned when empty. The main gun was fitted with a fume extractor and featured two-axis stabilization for adequate \"firing-on-the-move\". The main gun was also given case ejector actuated by the recoil action to which spent shell casings were ejected automatically out of the turret rear via a spring-loaded door after firing. The main gun was supplemented by a coaxial 7.62mm PKT series machine gun in the turret for anti-infantry defense. A 12.7mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun on the turret roof was optional and not generally seen in early production units. Up to 40 x 115mm projectiles were carried aboard, stored within the turret itself and primarily along the hull sides. 2,500 x 7.62mm rounds of machine gun ammunition were also carried for the coaxial machine gun. Power was derived from a V-55 12-cylinder diesel engine outputting at 580 horsepower. This supplied the vehicle with a top speed of 31 miles per hour on ideal surfaces with an operational range of 280 miles not including environmental factors.\n\r\nThe main gun was cleared to fire the requisite High-Explosive (HE) and Armor-Piercing (AP) projectiles of 115mm caliber. The HE breed consisted of the HE-FRAG-FS which stood for High-Explosive, Fragmentation, Fin-Stabilized. The HEAT-FS rounds was the High-Explosive, Anti-Tank, Fin-Stabilized variant. The AP round was the APFSDS - Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, Discarding Sabot. This projectile could range out at targets up to 1,100 yards away and penetrate up to 330mm of armor plate - a major upgrade from the projectile types fired from the 100mm main guns of the T-54 and T-55 series. The main gun held an elevation limitation of -6 to +16 degrees. One of the key limitations of the T-54/55 models were their lack of true \"hull down\" firing due to the main gun's depression restriction. The T-62 improved upon this limitation to an extent.\n\r\nThe T-62 was delivered with several notable standardized features including NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection for the crew as well as an automated fire extinguishing system which could also be manually actuated. An integrated snorkel could be erected prior to entering bodies of water and provide the T-62 with limited amphibious capabilities. The engine was used to generate a smoke screen, this essentially accomplished by injecting raw diesel into the engine for the desired result. The commander, gunner and driver positions all included infrared night vision devices for true day/night fighting capability. To keep the tank from becoming bogged over a trench or obstacle, a unique \"unditching\" beam was fitted under at the rear of the hull.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-62", "vehicle_type": "Medium Tank / Main Battle Tank (MBT)"}, {"id": "25dcb67b-cb7b-4c52-b7dd-90186e12b205", "year_model": "1961", "description": "\r\n        \tLogistics are at the heart of every successful ground campaign and the modern Russian Army - and the Soviet Army before it - has invested heavily in multiple-wheeled movers such as the Ural-375 series 6x6 medium-duty, multi-purpose 6x6 wheeled utility truck. The design is manufactured at the Ural Automotive Plant which was founded during the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945) in 1941. This has allowed the Ural truck series to remain in active production up until 1993 since its introduction in 1961 after it was selected to succeed an aging line of ZiL-157 trucks in same role.\n\r\nThe Ural-375 series went on to see widespread global adoption with forces from Angola to Egypt and Syria to Vietnam. East Germany, Iraq, and the Soviet Union are all former operators of the type.\n\r\nThe base framework makes up the chassis of alternative platforms including the lengthened Ural-375A, the Ural-375E KET-L recovery vehicle, the civilian-minded Ural-377 6x4 hauler, and the 6x6 Ural-375S. The definitive model remains the Ural-375D with its all-steel passenger cabin while the Ural-375DM is a modernized form of the D-model series and saw production into 1991.\n\r\nD-models have been used as the host vehicle to 85mm Divisional Field Guns as well as the famous BM-21 Grad Multiple-Launched Rocket System (MLRS) rocket-projecting vehicle.\n\r\nThe truck has a largely standard design arrangement with a crew cab seating three shoulder-to-shoulder. The driver sits front-left commanding the vehicle by way of a traditional steering column. The engine is seated in the bow behind a raised bumper assembly and protected headlamps. One axle is positioned under the engine compartment in the usual way while the rear is supported through a twin axle arrangement. The rear of the vehicle can be modified to suit the battlefield need and this includes rocket launching components, artillery systems, troop carriers, communications modules, canvas/tarp coverings, sideboard beds, and open-air flatbeds - such is the versatility of this proven vehicle.\n\r\nBetween the generous ground clearance and mud-running road tires, the truck is do-anything/go-anywhere type that serves its operators well.\n\r\nThe nation of Iran operates the Ural-375D in number from stocks received during the 1970s.\n\r\nChronologically, the Ural-375 has been superseded in the Russian military line-up by the Ural-4320 which was introduced around 1977.

The BTR-60 was a major improvement of the previous offering along many fronts, quite revolutionary in fact, and provided the Soviet military with a very capable and highly potent off-road/amphibious performer. The BTR-60 was the first in a long line of modern \"BTR-designated\" vehicles that included the follow-up BTR-70, BTR-80 and BTR-90 families whose influence went beyond that of the Soviet inventory. The BTR-60 was introduced in December of 1959 and entered serial production in 1960 (hence its designation), with local manufacture running until 1976 to which some 25,000 units were produced. The type was also built under license in Romania (as the TAB-71) which added another 1,872 vehicles into circulation. \n\r\nDesign of the BTR-60, begun in 1955, was largely spurred by the tactical limitations inherent in the BTR-152 and BTR-40 series appearing after World War 2. This initiative was furthered by a major reorganization of Soviet Army formations. The BTR-60 was then developed alongside the more sophisticated and tracked armored \"BMP-1\" series which saw both produced and utilized in large numbers worldwide. Design of the BTR-60 was attributed to V.A. Dedkov while the \"BTR\" designation was formed from the word \"BroneTRansporter\" appropriately translating to \"Armored Transport\".\n\r\nThe BTR-60 was highly conventional by modern standards though a grand departure from the norm concerning APCs of the time. The hull was fitted atop an independently suspended chassis which managed eight large road wheels, four to a side (two axles being steerable). The hull was well-shaped of welded steel with a sloped glacis plate, side facings and a squared-off hull roof. Armament was concentrated ahead of center and aft of the driving cabin in a turret emplacement (found primarily in the finalized/evolved production models). Overall weight was approximately 11.4 tons (Short) while the standard operating crew was three personnel (the driver, vehicle commander and dedicated gunner) with optional space for passengers in the central compartment. The fighting compartment allowed for combat-ready infantry to be carried in relative safety, protection against both small arms fire and artillery spray in play and entry/exit through several hinged hatches at the sides and roof of the vehicle. The driver and commander were each afforded a hatch all their own at the front left and right of the vehicle hull. Armor protection ranged from 5mm (hull floor) to 10mm (turret front). Primary armament was a 14.5mm KPVT heavy machine gun with 500 rounds allotted. This was backed by a 7.62mm PKT coaxial machine gun given 3,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\r\nPower for the BTR-60 was served through 2 x GAZ-40P series 6-cylinder gasoline-fueled engines developing 90 horsepower each (180 combined) running at 3,400rpm. The engines were paired at the rear of the hull, prohibiting use of a large powered entry/exit door common to more modern APCs. This afforded the vehicle an operational range of up to 310 miles with a maximum road speed of 50 miles per hour. The BTR-60 was designed with full amphibious qualities in mind (as were many other Soviet vehicles intended to fight in Europe) and could reach 6 miles per hour in water while propelled by a rear mounted jet shrouded by two hinged door plates.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BTR-60", "vehicle_type": "8x8 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "ab186c34-8b8e-48a7-bfe8-fb4bfdeda23e", "year_model": "1960", "description": "\r\n        \tThe ZU-23-2 is a light, towed anti-aircraft / air defense system developed by the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Design work began in the latter part of the decade and culminated with the system achieving operational status in 1960. Amazingly, the weapon has proven so sound that it is still in operation throughout the world and production continues to this day. To date, tens of thousands of the weapon type have been delivered across the globe and evolved into other useful variants and modernized when possible. The rather complicated designation arrangement used for the \"ZU-23-2\" is actually quite descriptive when broken down: ZU = Zenitnaya Ustanovka which translates to \"anti-aircraft mount\" in the Russian while \"23\" designates the type's barrel calibers and \"2\" signifies the number of barrels being utilized in the design.\n\r\nAt its core, the ZU-23-2 is intended to combat low-flying enemy aircraft as well as light-armored vehicles - the latter if required. The standard operating crew is typically six personnel though extreme circumstances can see the weapon being handled by a single operator. As a towed air defense system, the ZU-23-2 is made up of a wheeled carriage, the gun mount and the gun barrels. Two small road wheels allow for vehicular towed transport. These installations are lifted off of the ground and folded when the weapon system is prepped to fire. The mount sits atop a steel platform with a three-point adjustable stance that lifts the weapon system off of the ground and distributes the inherent recoil of the firing action. The gun system is comprised of 2 x 23mm gun barrels in a side-by-side arrangement. Optics are fitted as are integrated ammunition boxed designed to accept the required 23mm projectile cartridges. The gunner takes a position in a rear-set steel molded chair with foot rests located at the front sides of the gun mount. Traverse is essentially a full 360-degrees while elevation controls allow the guns to engage both land and airborne targets as required. Ammunition supply is only limited by the present ammunition carrier.\n\r\nThe ZU-23-2 design is centered around the pairing of two 2A14 series Afanasyev-Yakushev 23x152mm autocannons. Each barrel measures in at 6.5 feet in length and rated with a muzzle velocity of 3,182 feet per second. Range is listed out to 1.5 miles, reaching upwards of 6,500 feet and highly suitable for engaging low-flying enemy helicopter and strike aircraft. Each 23mm projectile weighs in at 0.37lbs. In practice, up to 400 rounds per minute could be reached while manufacturer specifications detailed an optimal rate-of-fire nearing 2,000 rounds per minute. Each gun is afforded 50 x 23mm projectiles from a standard ammunition fitting. Ammunition types range from Armor-Piercing Incendiary and High-Explosive to High-Explosive Fragmentation and Armor-Piercing Discarding Sabot-Tracer.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "ZU-23-2 / ZU-23", "vehicle_type": "Towed Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA)"}, {"id": "fbc6b7e9-1850-48c9-bc0a-84edba7ea66c", "year_model": "1958", "description": "\r\n        \tThe T-55 was a further improved version of the T-54 Main Battle Tank series of 1949 intended to counter the new American M60 tank (based on a highly modified form of the earlier M48 \"Patton\" series). Compared with the preceding model, the T-55 incorporated an all-new turret as well as NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection for the crew. The V-55 series diesel engine was reworked for an overall output of 580 horsepower through fuel injection and compression coupled with a power-assisted clutch and pneumatic engine start feature. and compression while the integrated engine smoke screen generation system was retained. The T-55 was given an increased operational due to the inclusion of a new internal fuel storage cell at the bow. Internal storage was also increased to raise the 100mm projectile count from 34 to 43. While the T-54made use of the 12.7mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun to counter low flying aerial threats, the T-55 removed this installation from the loader's hatch (later production forms after 1970 returned use of the 12.7mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun and were designated as T-55AM). Initial production models were known simply by the \"T-55\" designator. Production began in 1958 and lasted until 1963 while locally-produced Polish versions spanned production from 1958 to 1964. Czech production lasted from 1958 to 1983.\n\r\nExternally, the T-55 mimicked the clean, utilitarian style lines of the T-54 before it. The track system was dominated by the five large road wheels with the front most pair set noticeably apart from the remaining four rear sets. The drive sprocket remained at the rear of the design while the track idler was at the front with no track return rollers being used. The glacis plate was well-sloped and there was a shallow hull superstructure evident. The turret was located in the center of the design offering good balance while the engine was retained in a conventionally set rear compartment. Crew accommodations amounted to four personnel to include the driver in the hull and the tank commander, gunner and loader in the turret section. The turret itself was a well-sloped assembly with rounded sides and roof. The main gun barrel protruded a distance away from the turret and was seen with a fume extractor near the muzzle. A snorkel allowed for amphibious fording of water sources.\n\r\nThe T-55A model series appeared in 1963 and were produced into 1981 due to the lackluster response of the newer T-62 in sales and performance. A new anti-radiation lining was introduced as well as an improved NBC suite. The SG MT series 7.62mm coaxial machine gun was superseded by the newer PKT series system while the bow-mounted machine gun was given up in favor of carrying an additional six more 100mm projectiles. It was not until 1970 that the loader's 12.7mm DShK anti-aircraft machine gun was brought back into the fold.\n\r\nLike the T-54 before it, the T-55 existed in several command tank marks made up of the T-55K1, T-55K2, T-55K3, T-55AK1, T-55AK2, T-55AK3, T-55MK1, T-55MK2 and T-55MK3. All command tank versions reduced the 100mm ammunition count by five rounds for the needed internal space.\n\r\nModernized T-55s were fielded with the TSh-2B-32P sighting device. The ZET-1 vehicle protection system included a net cast over the main gun barrel. The T-55M (also known as the T-55AM) was another modernization attempt that included an improved fire control system (FCS) as well as an improved main gun stabilization system, sights and V-55U series diesel engine. The T-55M also brought about use of smoke grenade dischargers and a more balanced suspension system. Additionally, anti-radiation features were implemented for nuclear combat. Radios were upgraded for the better while armor was increased at some critical facings. Side armor skirts were also introduced for some basic point defense along the upper hull sides. Support for firing the \"Bastion\" anti-tank guided missile launcher. The T-55M-1 marked T-55M production models delivered with the V-46-5M series diesel engines of 691 horsepower. A laser range finder was fitted over the main gun near the mantlet.\n\r\nThe T-55AD was given the \"Drozd\" active vehicle countermeasures system intended to better protect the tank from incoming anti-tank missiles. The T-55AD-1 was similar models though delivered with the V-46-5M series diesel engines of 691 horsepower.\n\r\nThe T-55MV incorporated \"Kontakt-1\" Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) blocks for much improved protection against incoming anti-tank missiles. The use of ERA replaced the Drozd protection scheme of noted earlier. The T-55MV-1s were nothing more than T-55MV models with the V-46-5M diesel engine of 691 horsepower.\n\r\nThe T-55M5 brought about use of the \"Kontakt-5\" ERA block package. The fire control system (FCS) was upgraded as were gunner sights. The hull was lengthened some while the engine was improved for the better. The T-55M6 mark was slightly similar though incorporating a six pair of road wheels for increased road displacement. The engine of choice was the V-46-5M diesel series of 691 horsepower. The powerful 125mm 2A46M main gun of the newer T-72 Main Battle Tank was instituted as well as its automatic loader, reducing the internal turret crew to two persons. Armor protection was further increased to counter new battlefield threats.\n\r\nThe Obyekt 155ML was a developmental test bed for trialing the AT-3 \"Sagger\" anti-tank guided missile launcher. The T-55K was another experimental T-55 used for evaluating the \"Uran\" system - a networked television video camera communicating with a receiving BTR-50PU armored wheeled command station.\n\n\r\nThe T-55 Main Battle Tank was widely exported to Soviet allies and nation states. This led to it being used in a myriad of conflicts ranging from Africa to the Middle East as well as within Asia. T-55s were used in anger by the Arabs against Israel in the 1967 Six Day War as well as the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to which Israeli netted over 1,000 captured systems. These were reconstituted against their former owners in modified forms fitting a 105mm main gun, General Motors engines and an Israeli fire control system (FCS). After their useful lives, the types were further modified to become armored personnel carriers or sold off to interested buyers. The T-55 was also showcased in the Vietnam War against America where they were ultimately used to break down the gates of the Presidential Palace. T-55s fared rather poorly in the 1991 Gulf War where they came up against technologically-laden Western counterparts to which their ranks were decimated. Some were even in play during the 2003 American invasion of Iraq over a decade later - again proving no match. Further deployment saw them in combat during the Balkans crisis.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "T-55", "vehicle_type": "Medium Tank / Main Battle Tank (MBT)"}, {"id": "71ebe8c2-dc1e-4384-9526-d1ae56767888", "year_model": "1957", "description": "\r\n        \tThe original SA-2 Guideline design was engineered to track down and destroy the less-maneuverable high-altitude American bombers, more precisely - the Air Force's stalwart, the B-52 Stratofortress. The capabilities of the Guideline system were highly valued, so much so that all other primary air defense systems (with the exception of those marking Moscow), were replaced by the newer SA-2's. By 1965, no fewer than 1,000 SA-2 Guideline launch sites had been established throughout the Soviet Empire and its satellite locations with a large contingent residing in the Soviet-controlled East Germany.\n\r\nThe first confirmed downing of an aircraft by the SA-2 system was of a Taiwanese reconnaissance aircraft of the RB-57 type, destroyed in 1959 over China. Successes continued to follow the system including the notable downing of Gary Power's U-2 Spy plane that reached the global headlines (more than one missile was actually launched and the aircraft was hit several times before going down). This single act resulted in a re-thinking of military and reconnaissance planning when dealing with high-altitude Soviet air defense systems.\n\r\nDuring the Vietnam conflict with America, Soviet-supplied SA-2's to the North Vietnamese were responsible for aggressively targeting and destroying US Navy, Air Force and Marine aircraft. As a direct response, the United States was forced to develop counter-weapons systems to help combat the very serious SA-2 threat.\n\r\nDespite advancements in Electronic CounterMeasure (ECM) systems and tactics, the SA-2 system still enjoyed relative success throughout the conflict and afterwards (some running through modernization programs to help extend the service life of the system). Never the less, the SA-2 Guideline would eventually begin giving way to the more advanced SA-10 series of surface-to-air missile systems.\n\r\nThe base system combines fragmentation warhead with proximity, contact and command fusing capability mounted to a two-stage solid rocket fuel booster system. The warhead weighs in at roughly 434 pounds and can be fitted with an alternative nuclear-capable warhead if need be.

The missile component was seated over the top of the vehicle and included an integral powered system that raised the missile when readied to fire. Recoil legs were lowered at the rear of the vehicle chassis to help counter the effects of the launching missile.

An 8 man crew was used for the gun section and an AT-S medium tractor was the prime mover along with the URAL-375 6x6 heavy truck. The barrel was made to the length of 17 feet and capped by a large, double-slotted baffle to help reduce recoil.  A gun shield was mounted ahead of the wheels to protect the breech, recoil mechanism and crew. A firing pedestal was lowered to the grown before the weapon was engaged and the \"split-trail carriage\", also rested on the pedestal, provided full 360-degree traversal. The base gun mounting hardware gave -5 degrees to +65 degrees of elevation with a traverse of 58 degrees from centerline.\n\r\nThe main projectile used by the howitzer was the HE-FRAG (High-Explosive, FRAGmentation) weighing 95.92 lb which led to the sustained rate-of-fire of one round-per-minute. Special ammunition types included an AP (Armor-Piercing) shell of 237 lb that could penetrate 124mm (4.88\") of armor thickness out to 1,000 meters (1,095 yards).  Smoke and illuminating projectiles are also available along with a shell containing steel flechettes for anti-infantry use. Another form dispersed anti-personnel mines over a target area. Still another projectile type has become the \"Krasnopol\" semi-active, laser-guided smart munition.\n\r\nA trained and experienced gunnery crew could stand to make 5 to 6 rounds-per-minute (1 rpm sustained). Range for HE-FRAG projectiles was 19,040 yards while Rocket-Assisted Projectile (RAP) landed as far out as 26,245 yards.\n\r\nDespite its Soviet origins, the Russian military still relies to some degree on the M1955 series with as many as 1,000 guns still thought available. Efforts were made to modernize the design and keep it a viable battlefield solution for decades to come. The \"Khitin\" is an example of this, having added an automatic rammer and sporting an increased RoF to eight RPM.\n\r\nChina copied the gun as the \"Type 66\" and this variant went on to see deliveries all around the globe.  Type 66 was made with few changes, making most Soviet parts interchangeable along with using all types of in-circulation 152mm ammunition. The Type 83 became a self-propelled version, most likely influenced by the Soviet 2S3 series vehicle. Similarly, the SPH 152mm M1974 of North Korea sees either the M1955 or Type 66 gun fitted to a tracked chassis.\n\r\nCurrent operators range from Angola and Armenia to Vietnam and Yemen. Romanian models are designated A411. Former operates included Albania, East Germany / Germany, Finland and the former Yugoslavia (as the M84 \"NORA\" gun-howitzer).\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "D-20 (Model 1955)", "vehicle_type": "152mm Towed Field Howitzer"}, {"id": "1114f288-8970-4502-bcb1-fdc121856ea3", "year_model": "1955", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet Army learned the value of tank-killing, armor-defeating weapons during World War 2 (1939-1945) when it squared off against the might of the Wehrmacht armored divisions. Most of the solutions centered around high-velocity, towed field guns with effective penetrating projectiles and it was this sort of thinking that continued for Soviets into the Cold War period (1947-1991). In 1955 was debuted a new, towed ant-tank gun and this product quickly became the standardized weapon of the Army and other Soviet-aligned nations and foreign allies followed in equipping the type. The MT-12 \"Rapira\" series was in operation service with Soviet forces up until the latter part of the 1980s but went on to serve a plethora of global operators from Algeria and Armenia to Ukraine and Uzbekistan - many of which continue to field the weapon even today (2017).\n\r\nThe MT-12 has also been recognized by the formal designation of \"2A19\" and also as the \"T-12\". The type was taken into service to replace the aging line of 100mm BS-3 series field guns which had been in service since 1944 (World War 2).\n\r\nAt the core of the T-12 design was its chosen 100mm projectile fired from a smoothbore barrel assembly. Compared to the BS-3, the MT-12 was given an all new gun tube and revised two-wheeled carriage to go along with a gun shield - all based on lessons learned from the fighting of World War 2. The barrel measured 63 calibers which made up a good portion of the overall length of 31 feet for the complete weapon system. The gun shield held a three-sided, angled appearance and was sloped for basic ballistics protection - a vision port being cut-out from the upper left side for the aimer. The carriage was of a traditional two-wheeled, rubber-tired design with tow arms located towards the rear. The wheels were elevated from the ground when the system was made ready-to-fire. The gun mounting hardware allowed for an elevation span of -6 to +20 degrees and traversal of 27-degrees right or left of centerline.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "MT-12 / 2A19 (Rapira)", "vehicle_type": "100mm Towed Anti-Tank (AT) Gun"}, {"id": "dfd996fa-e075-42cb-aedc-5f1bec89c328", "year_model": "1954", "description": "\r\n        \tThe M-46 (formal designation of \"130mm Towed Field Gun M1954) was a Soviet Cold War-era battlefield implement designed to fulfill a variety of roles in support of infantry and armor actions. The system was first unveiled to Western observers in 1954 (hence its \"M1954\" designation) and subsequently went on to be fielded by a myriad of countries with relations to the Soviet Union. This included many military forces in the Middle East, across Africa and in South America as well as allied states in Eastern Europe. Despite its early Cold War roots, the M-46 still maintains a battlefield presence in the inventories of countries even today with modernization programs designed to increase the longevity and tactical usefulness of such a system.\n\r\nIts success has been proven by the plethora of operators using the weapon system and the countless wars that she has participated in. Her notable operators have included (or still do) Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, China, Croatia, Cuba, Finland (as the \"130 K54\"), India, Iraq, Iraq, Israel, Laos, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia (Soviet Union), Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Vietnam, Yemen and Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia, Finland and Serbia have all phased their M-46 systems out. Israel only received their M-46s as spoils from their many Middle East conflicts, with approximately 100 examples captured. The Chinese license production copy of the Soviet M-46 is designated as the Type 59-1 and produced under the NORINCO banner.\n\r\nHer actions have seen the M-46 participate in the Sri Lankan Civil War (1983-2009), the Sino-Indian War (1962), the Indo-Pak War (1965), the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002), the South African Border War (1966-1989), the Six Day War (1967), the Sino-Soviet Border Conflict (1969), the Cambodian Civil War (1967-1975), the Vietnam War (1959-1975), the Yom Kipper War (1973), the Sino-Vietnamese War (1979), the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan (1979-1989), the Gulf War (1990-1991), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Yugoslav Wars (1991-2001) and the Invasion of Iraq (2003).\n\r\nDesign of the M-46 is typical of weapons in this class. Her long, slender barrel sits out and over her base and carriage, sporting two large road wheels for transport (and additional pair of road wheels is sometimes added). The weapon system is supported by legs that fan out aft, semi-recessed into the ground to accept the violent recoil. There is an angular shield to either side of the barrel base for limited protection to the operating crew from small arms fire. Her muzzle brake is vented and noticeably large at the barrel end. Her size is such that she can be transported into action with relative ease when compared to her larger cousins and set up just about anywhere that her size allows.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "M-46 (Model 1954)", "vehicle_type": "130mm Field Gun System"}, {"id": "b114e0af-93f6-4920-8aa3-ca672618378a", "year_model": "1952", "description": "\r\n        \tWhen the Soviets discovered the value of battlefield rockets in saturating entire areas during the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945) it became impossible for the Red Army to give up use of such valuable systems. This led to a progressive line of \"rocket projectors\" witnessed through the entirety of the Cold War years (1947-1991), each design improving on battlefield effectiveness. These rocket projectors were exported in the thousands to Soviet-allied nations and states, ultimately seeing combat service in a plethora of regional conflicts for their ease-of-operation, contained training and maintenance requirements, and low-cost procurement.\n\r\nThe BM-14 (\"Boyevaya Mashima\" = \"Combat Machine\")  carried on the Soviet tradition of a rocket-projecting truck (the classic truck form still being the BM-13 \"Katyusha\" of World War 2 fame).

The turret fitted the Soviet Army standard 76.2mm D-56T main gun and featured traversal of -4 /+30 degrees while capable of firing a standard set of projectiles - ranging from High-Explosive (HE) to AP-T (Armor Piercing) and HE-FRAG (High-Explosive, FRAGmentation) rounds. For local defense, the vehicle carried a 7.62mm machine gun in a coaxial fitting while some models also benefited from adding a 12.7mm Heavy Machine Gun (HMG) for local air defense (DShKM type weapon). Additional fuel tanks could also be added to exterior of the hull to increase operating ranges by some 68 miles (110 kilometers).\n\r\nAs an amphibious combat vehicle, the PT-76 was given the inherent ability to traverse water sources. Its automotive components were shared between the BTR-50 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), SA-6 \"Gainful\" Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system, and the ZSU-23-4 Anti-Aircraft (AA) gun and included a torsion-bar suspension system for cross-country travel. The powerpack of the PT-76 was also the same one encountered on the T-55 Main Battle Tank (MBT) - this being a V-6 type diesel-fueled unit.\n\r\nDespite the positive qualities built into the 14.5 tonne PT-76, it lacked NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection for its crew of three (driver, commander and gunner), was rather large dimensionally-speaking, and showcased thin armor protection for a frontline vehicle.\n\r\nTotal production numbers of the PT-76 reached over 12,000 vehicles before the end with manufacture stemming from VTZ and the Kirov Factory of the Soviet Union from 1951 until 1969. The last PT-76 entered service in 1967 and modernization programs and new turret were devised to keep the system relevant into the 1980s. China eventually took up production of a related vehicle form designated the \"Type 63\".\n\r\nThe PT-76 went on to have an extensive combat history for its part in the last century - from the Vietnam War (1955-1975) and the Indo-Pak War (1965) until the Second Chechen War (1999) and the Second Persian Gulf War (2003).

The gun was developed in the late 1940's and was influenced by captured German systems of World War 2 - specifically, the 5.5-cm Gerat 58 and the 5cm Flak 41 series guns. The S-60 itself became a short-to-medium range weapon featuring robust qualities and able to engage lowing flying aircraft and even lightly armored vehicles. The weapon system was introduced to Warsaw Pact nations in 1950 and soon after, the gun was sold to communist-friendly nations throughout the Middle East and South Asia.   \n\nS-60 Walk-Around\n\r\nThe original S-60 had a long thin barrel capped by a multi-perforated muzzle brake. A large gun shield was affixed to both sides of the barrel and served as a reminder of her German origins. Regardless, the shield did little in protecting the seven-man crew charged with maintaining, arming and manning the weapon system. The shield folded away during transport as did the horizontal ammunition feed tray. Four road wheels supported the carriage during road travel. A travel brace was fitted between the forward pair of tires and served to lock the main barrel in place during journeys.\n\nS-60 Ammunition\n\r\nThe S-60 fired a 57mmx384R caliber six pound projectile and, in 1950, two basic types were made available - the armor piercing (API-T) round and the high explosive (HEI-T) round.  The crew would load the 30-pound, 4-round clips into the horizontal feed tray. To increase loading speed, the designers attached an ammunition \"ready rack\" to the left side of the S-60 breech that could hold 4 x 4 round clips, ready to fire, near the feed mechanism. The gun proved stable when fired and made use of a three-point jack system which would lift the gun system off of the ground from her four wheeled carriage. The normal Soviet prime mover for the time, and the vehicle charged with towing the S-60, was the Ural-375 general purpose truck - an all-around 4.5 ton 6x6 vehicle produced at the Russian Ural Automotive Plant.  The truck had two gas tanks holding 95 gallons each and her range was 450 miles at a 25 mile per hour pace.\n\nThe S-60 is Improved\n\r\nDemand for sales in the Warsaw Pact countries led to improvements in the S-60's fire control system. Initially, the gun operated only with an on-carriage optical system for target rangefinding. As the enemy improved her fighting aircraft technology, the initial manually-operated firing system became limited. As a solution, the Soviets adapted a flap wheel PUAZO-5 director and SON-4 radar system for improved capabilities. The calculator and the radars were transported into action by the same Ural 375 series trucks. As the radar was introduced, the range of the S-60 was increased from 4,000 meters (using the original optical ranging equipment) to 6,000 meters with the SON-4 radar system.  The radar improved the defensive role of the S-60 against planes, helicopters and even some light armored vehicles. Soon, this system was upgraded with the PUAZO-6/60 director and the SON-9 or SON-9A radars.  A self-propelled gun (SPG) model was then produced with both twin- and quad-barrel fittings. These versions were mated to the T-54 main battle tank chassis and designated as S-68 (or ZSU-57-2) in 1957.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "AZP S-60", "vehicle_type": "Towed Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA)"}, {"id": "167efc8a-03ad-4f42-bcb4-cbcdb26a387d", "year_model": "1950", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet Army adjusted their battlefield doctrine following their experiences in World War 2 (1939-1945) against the Axis powers - in particular Germany. The Soviet advances proved effective on the whole but at high cost to infantry which were intended to defend its fast-moving fleet of tanks from enemy infantry ambushes. This provided a logistical challenge to Soviet warplanners who had to rely on a collection of local solutions and foreign-born implements like the American M3 half-track via Lend-Lease and captured German half-tracks of similar form and function. The solution to this challenge in the post-war years led to the development of a infantry-mover with good mechanized capabilities designed to keep up with Soviet Army tanks - the BTR-152 of 1950.\n\r\nThe \"BTR\" designation stems from the word \"Bronetransporter\" which translates to \"Armored Transporter\".\n\r\nUtilizing the half-tracks as their starting point, Soviet engineers realized a similar vehicle form based on the local ZiS-151 series 6x6 wheeled truck. This led to the natural and highly conventional arrangement of a front-mounted engine, central driver's compartment, and a passenger cabin fitted over the rear section of the chassis. The fully suspended, six-wheeled arrangement would allow for the necessary cross-country travel while speeds would keep up with the fast-moving Soviet armored vehicles. Drive power was through a 6-cylinder, gasoline-fueled engine which allowed for a maximum road speed of 45 miles per hour to be reached with operational road ranges peaking at 400 miles. Powered, closable slats at the front of the vehicle were intended to protect the engine in a combat environment. A spare road wheel was held along the rear face of the hull superstructure which also showcased a door arrangement for embarking/disembarking troops.\n\r\nThe open-topped rear crew compartment lessened the vehicle's weight and allowed for the crew to engage enemy forces as well as disembark the vehicle at speed if required (over the sides). Engagement of outside foes was also aided by the available firing ports presented. Lacking a roof, occupants were at the mercy of the elements and general battlefield dangers so a tarp was offered for some coverage. The superstructure itself was well-angled for ballistics protection and made up of welded steel plates managing up to 15mm thickness along the frontal facings. As designed, the standard operating crew was two (driver and commander) with seating for up to eighteen infantry and their base fighting gear. The operating crew's positions were accessed through hinged, automobile-style doors along the sides of the hull. Armored visors with built-in vision slots were fitted where the natural truck's windscreen would have been. When \"buttoned-up\", the crew were allowed use of periscopes for situational awareness.\n\r\nPrimary armament centered on a 7.62mm general purpose, anti-infantry machine gun. This could be substituted with a 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun to counter low-flying aerial threats and light-armored vehicles and up to two additional 7.62mm machine guns could be fitted atop trainable pintle mounts for added suppression firepower. Ammunition stowed aboard depended largely on the armament installed but typically numbered 500 x 12.7mm cartridges or 1,250 x 7.62mm cartridges in boxes.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BTR-152", "vehicle_type": "Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)"}, {"id": "d74e1ac1-5017-47a3-b924-7b0267733b04", "year_model": "1950", "description": "\r\n        \tThe BTR-50 series of Soviet armored personnel carriers was developed in the 1950s and served for a time to good effect.

The system was fielded with Soviet-friendly nations during the Cold War.\n\r\nAt its core, the BTR-50 APC was a most fundamental design. The system was crewed by two personnel and additional seating for some 10 combat-ready infantry was available at the rear of the hull. The crew sat in an open-topped compartment which exposed them to any kind of battlefield element that could prove quite the detriment. The initial production model appeared as the BTR-50P though this was followed up by a closed-top version in the BTR-50PK. When it appeared in operational service, the BTR-50 became only the first fully-tracked armored personnel carrier system for the Red Army.\n\r\nArmament of the base BTR-50P consisted of a single 7.62mm machine gun mounted on a pintle at forward hull. Beyond this, and any personal weapons carried by the crew, there were provisions for the addition of a 57mm or 85mm anti-tank gun which could be set up and fired from the rear.

All of the major participants of World War 2 understood the value of these close-in defensive network systems and the Soviets proved no exception. At the end of the war, development continued on more powerful and capable anti-aircraft artillery systems to combat the forces of the West. These endeavors eventually produced the \"KS-19\" series of 100mm caliber in the late 1940s. The 100mm systems were intended to replace the aged 85mm systems then in use. Design of the KS-19 was attributed to L.V. Lulyev and these guns saw considerable combat actions in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, naturally on the side of the communists. Approximately 5,000 KS-19 guns were produced - some still seeing frontline active service with nations today.\n\r\nDesign-wise, the KS-19 was highly conventional in its approach and clearly showcased its World War 2 influence based on German and Soviet experiences. The system consisted of several major components making up the overall weapon which included the barrel, gun mount, platform and the transport carriage. The 100mm (3.94inch) barrel was of notable length and rifled for accuracy, further capped by a multi-baffled muzzle brake that dispelled gases away from the gun and crew. The barrel was set within a heavy duty mount which contained the recoil mechanism, elevation/traverse controls and gunnery platform for the operating crew. The carriage was wheeled with single rubber tires fitted to each corner of the assembly along steel rims with a folding vehicle tow loop installation at one end. Recoil absorbing \"legs\" were extended from the carriage sides and lowered for a firmer firing stance. Elevation was limited to +85/-3 degrees with a 360-degree traverse, this accomplished manually via various hand wheels. The crew would sit behind a small-area armored shield for some basic protection though no overhead, side or rear protection was given from the elements or battlefield dangers. The vehicle was traditionally towed by a heavy duty Soviet military tractor for it weighed over 21,000lbs and sported a 31 foot length to which the gun barrel was locked down for transport at one end of the carriage assembly. The firing action of the KS-19 consisted of a semi-automatic, horizontal sliding wedge breechblock system with a powered rammer and an automatic fuse-setter. All of this was tied to a PUAZO-6/19 directional system and a SON-9 series fire control radar array. The KS-19 crew consisted of no fewer than 15 personnel making up the various gunnery specialists, traverse/elevation personnel, ammunition handlers and setup/take down crew.\n\r\nAs an anti-aircraft defense weapon, the KS-19 was issued standardized high-explosive (HE), high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG) and general fragmentation (FRAG) type single-piece, ready-to-fire projectiles. These served the weapon system well in their timed, area-detonated action in which the skies could be littered with exploding devices as enemy aircraft attempted to traverse the targeted airspace. Furthermore, the Soviets - like the wartime Germans before them - found the KS-19s inherent  firepower and penetration values suitable for the anti-armor role and developed equally suitable Armor-Piercing Tracer (AP-T) and Armor-Piercing Capped Tracer (APC-T) projectiles for this specific role. The KS-19 was also cleared to fire other like-minded 100mm-based projectiles as needed from the Soviet inventory, expanding its tactical, logistical and battlefield usefulness even more. A well-trained and experienced crew could let off up to 15 rounds per minute, provided good barrage fire into the sky - especially when linked to a network of such gun systems in defense of a given target area. Ranges against aircraft were out to 49,200 feet utilizing the proximity fuse and approximately 41,600 feet with the timed fuse. When used in the anti-armor role, the gun - now being fired horizontally as opposed to vertically - fielded a range of up to 13 miles.\n\r\nThe \"KS-19M2\" was one known variant of the KS-19 family line.

Such weapons provided a much-needed shock value against enemy forces and preceded a major offensive alongside huge barrages of artillery fire. The various \"Katyusha\" systems - BM-8, BM-13 and BM-31 - fulfilled this role during the conflict and their designs revolved around adoption of an existing 6x6 wheeled truck chassis with cab and flatbed mating a limited traverse rocket-launching platform. Following the close of the war in 1945, thought was given to a new generation of similar vehicles and one such development became the \"BM-24\" series. Today, weapons belonging to this class are categorized under the \"MLRS\" designation - \"Multiple Launch Rocket System\" - their primary purpose remaining shock value and saturation of target areas at range.\n\r\nThe BM-24 followed the same design form and function as the BM offerings before it.  The launcher component was a rather simplistic steel cage consisting of 12 x 240mm rockets, each capable of holding warheads (including chemical) to suite the mission need. The original vehicle of choice was the multi-purpose ZiS-151 6x6 series featuring a single forward axle and two rear axles. The cab held enough room for up to three persons including the driver (a typical crew numbered six). Power was supplied through a 5.6L ZiS-121 6-cylinder engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. Production of the truck model began in 1947 and spanned into 1958 out of Automotive Factory No. 2 in Moscow - Zavod Imeni Stalina (hence the \"ZiS\" designation). In 1956, this factory was handed a new name - \"Zavod Imeni Likhacheva\" - and, thusly, the designation of the truck appropriately changed to \"ZiL-151\". ZiL-151 marks were eventually superseded by the ZiL-157 series if 1958.\n\r\nThe BM-24 was used in considerable numbers (in the thousands) by the Soviet Army. The vehicle was adopted by Soviet customers worldwide including Egypt (seeing use in the Six Day War), China, North Korea and Iran as well as others. The BM-24 launch platform was also mated to the AT-S artillery tractor to produce the related \"BM-24T\" model mark. These featured a track-and-wheel arrangement with a larger, fully-enclosed cab armored.

The ZPU-1 was nothing more than a single-barreled version of the successful ZPU anti-aircraft family line mounting the Soviet 14.5mm KPV heavy machine gun. The weapon system was designed as a cost-effective anti-aircraft system to counter low-flying aircraft within reach of a 14.5mm heavy caliber system. Such a reliable and resilient piece of military hardware has proven a favorite among cash-strapped and budget conscious armies of the world and some 50 countries have, at one time or another, utilized the ZPU series guns for air defense work. All versions of the ZPU entered operational service in 1949 and some continue to see widespread use even today as noted by their appearance in after-action reports following the American invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\r\nDesign of the ZPU-1 is highly utilitarian and conventional. The system is essentially made up of three major components that include the barrel, gun mount and carriage - though the barrel and gun mount can be fitted to a vehicle for an improvised mobile weapons platform if desired. The air-cooled 14.5mm machine gun sits on a semi-flexible mounting that allows for engagement elevations of -8 to +88 degrees. Since the gun mount is fixed into the ZPU base carriage, the entire ZPU-1 system must be turned in order to achieve traverse. However, this does allow for traversal of a full 360-degrees. Maximum range of the gun system is out to 8,749 yards reaching aircraft as high up as 16,404 feet. However, the ZPU-1 remains most effective in engaging aircraft under 5,000 feet. A practical rate-of-fire for the 14.5mm machine gun is about 150 rounds per minute. The weapon base is fitted to a two-wheeled, rubber-tired carriage system with a tow arm for ground transport by light or heavy vehicles. A typical ZPU-1 crew is four personnel. The early optical sights of all ZPU-1s were updated in the 1950s. The 14.5mm barrel can be changed out when overheated.\n\r\nThe ZPU is cleared to fire a variety of ammunition types including an API (Armor-Piercing Incendiary), API-T (Armor-Piercing Incendiary - Tracer) and I-T (Incendiary - Tracer) type. The API (also known as the BS.41) features a full metal jacketed bullet that sports a tungsten carbide core. Penetration of this cartridge is out to 547 yards. The API-T (also known as the BZT) is a full metal jacketed round featuring a steel core and includes a tracer round during active firing for visually training the weapon system against a target. The I-T round is also known by the designation of \"ZP\". Typically, some 1,200 rounds of 14.5mm ammunition are supplied to a ZPU-1 crew though this may vary based on operator and ammunition carrier. ZPU ammunition was produced in Soviet factories as well as at facilities in Communist Bulgaria, China, Poland and Romania. Egypt also undertook production of ZPU cartridges for a time.\n\r\nAs the ZPU series was wholly Soviet in origin, it was not surprising to find it in the inventories of supported states and allied nations from in the Cold War years. The ZPU series was actively used throughout the Korean War by both North Korean and Chinese army troops against UN aircraft from 1950-1953. Additionally, the NVA utilized the weapon as a low-flying deterrent against the might of American Army helicopters in the upcoming Vietnam War of the 1960s-1970s. Saddam Hussein's forces were equipped with the ZPU types during the 1991 Gulf War. Most recently, examples of ZPU systems were recovered by coalition troops following the fall of Iraq in the 2003 American invasion showing that they were still in active use with the nation.\n\r\nMajor variants of the ZPU family line include the single-barreled ZPU-1, the double-barreled ZPU-2 and the quad-barreled ZPU-4. Each are easily recognizable and their designations clearly mark their respective versions based on number of barrels utilized. The ZPU has also been produced by the Chinese military industry under their own localized designations (Type 58/ ZPU-2 and Type 56/ZPU-4). The ZPU-1 and ZPU-2 are both transported on their integrated two-wheeled carriages while the ZPU-4 is moved by way of its four-wheeled carriage system. Additionally, the larger ZPU-2 and ZPU-4 systems require a standard operating crew of five personnel.\n\r\nIn the Russian Army inventory, the ZPU-1 has since been replaced by the more potent 23mm ZU-23 double-barreled air defense cannon system.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "ZPU-1", "vehicle_type": "Single-Barrel, Towed Anti-Aircraft (AA) Gun System"}, {"id": "90b4490d-c932-46f8-aa1f-ea51afdb689c", "year_model": "1949", "description": "\r\n        \tExperience in World War 2 (1939-1945) led the Soviet Army to developing small, portable anti-aircraft gun systems centered around a suitable mounting with wheeled carried and an adequate rate-of-fire to combat the threat posed by low-flying aircraft and light-skinned vehicles. The \"ZPU\" line was born with design work stemming from 1945 and begat a family of similar-minded weapon systems led by the single-barreled ZPU-1, the twin-barreled ZPU-2 and the four-barreled ZPU-4. The first system entered service in 1949 and still sees combat service with many operators today (2014).\n\r\nThe ZPU-2 is the two-barreled form combining the firepower of two 14.7mm heavy machine guns fed from individual ammunition cassettes. The machine guns feature \"quick-change\" barrels to combat overheating and are managed through a basic action by a sole operator while the entire gunnery crew typically numbers five. The gun is connected to its mounting hardware to which then the entire system is affixed to a two-wheeled carriage assembly that allows the weapon to either be wheeled short distances by a crew or driven by mover vehicle to a new location. The twin-gun approach instantly doubles the effectiveness of the original ZPU-1 single-gun series and is not as complex or ammunition-hungry as the subsequent ZPU-4 models. The guns are cleared to fire standard Armor-Piercing Incendiary (API) projectiles, similar rounds with a Tungsten core (API-T) and Instant Incendiary (II) ammunition as required.\n\r\nThe weapon system sports a traveling weight around 2,200lbs and displays a weight of 1,400lbs when made ready to fire. The mounting system allows for an elevation range of +90 to -7 degrees allowing the guns to engage both land- and air-based targets. Traversal is a full 360-degree due to the wheeled nature of the carriage. The guns reach out to 16,400 feet against air targets (4,600 feet effective range) and out to 26,250 feet against ground targets. The carriage carries 2,400 rounds of 14.7mm ammunition.\n\r\nZPU-2 guns have seen combat actions in some of the most famous conflicts of the 20th Century including the Korean War (1950-1953), the Vietnam War (1955-1975) and the Persian Gulf War (1991). Due to its Soviet origins, the ZPU-2 has seen widespread sales and use by many Soviet-allied and aligned nations and states including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, and Vietnam.\n\r\nThe weapon was produced in China as the Type 58 and in Poland as the PKM-2. Local ammunition production also occurred in Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Poland and Romania.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "ZPU-2", "vehicle_type": "Twin-Barreled, Towed Anti-Aircraft (AA) Gun System"}, {"id": "eef692eb-49a3-42b1-815f-16b60e301570", "year_model": "1949", "description": "\r\n        \tThe ZPU-4 anti-aircraft gun was developed in the post-war Soviet Union, seeing official operational service beginning in 1949. The towed artillery system was completed with four air-cooled, quick-change 14.5mm heavy machine guns featuring a maximum range out to 8,000 meters (roughly 5 miles) and an altitude range of 5,000 meters (3.1 miles) -  this weapon was proven more effective in the 1,400 meter / 0.86 miles - altitude range. Improved optical gun sights were added later in its production life to help increase its battlefield effectiveness. The system could be set up and made ready-to-fire in less than thirty seconds, making it a flexible mobile air defense system. It went on to serve the Soviet Union well during its time as a frontline weapon and stocked the inventories of many Soviet-aligned customers through export.\n\r\nThe ZPU-4 anti-aircraft system received its baptism of fire through operation by combat forces of China and North Korea during the Korean War (1950-1953). It saw considerable use against low-flying aircraft in the Vietnam War (1955-1975) where it became one of the most feared anti-aircraft weapons for American helicopters as the four-barreled arrangement could easily pierce critical components of the low-flying, slow-moving machines. Iraq managed a stock of these guns during the Persian Gulf War of 1991 and many of these fell to disuse after the American-led invasion of 2003. The ZPU-4 has been witnessed in combat service as recently as the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present).\n\r\nMany countries have since replaced the aging ZPU-4 weapon - which relied on heavy machine guns - in favor of the ZU-23 anti-aircraft defense system - relying on 23mm autocannons. However, the ZPU-4 it still continues in frontline service with a handful of nations today (2011) including that of North Korea. The weapon went on to see extensive export to Soviet-aligned nations during the Cold War years, peak usage marking over 50 total operators. Chinese factories also locally produced variants of the gun system (under license) as the \"Type 56\" and \"Type 58\".\n\r\nThe ZPU-4 is typically seen in its towed/wheeled configuration integrating the weapon, crew seating, optics, and mounting hardware along a four-wheeled carriage to be towed by mover vehicle. The gun can also be removed for use as a stationary weapon or set atop the rear of a vehicle for mobile fire power. Besides its inherent value in tackling low-flying aerial targets, the system can prove equally-effective against light-armored vehicles while also having a tremendous psychological effect on unprotected infantry.\n\r\nThe ZPU-4 belongs to a family of Soviet anti-aircraft guns designated around the number of barrels in use. The ZPU-1 was given a single barrel while the ZPU-2 showcased a pair of guns. Appropriately, the ZPU-4 followed with its four gun arrangement.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "ZPU-4", "vehicle_type": "Four-Barreled, Towed Anti-Aircraft (AA) Gun System"}, {"id": "574ff2ec-5d73-48b7-a11e-8863754fa2d3", "year_model": "1943", "description": "\r\n        \tThe IS-1 was born out of a Soviet Army need for more formidable tracked weapon systems to combat the ever-growing power of German tanks - particularly the newer Panther and Tiger I series appearing by the end of 1942. Initially, the KV-1 and KV-2 series were a limited answer but these ultimately proved too cumbersome in the heat of combat and generally not highly regarded by their crews - particularly the high-profiled KV-2. Both lacked the necessary mobility needed for ever-changing fronts of modern warfare concerning World War 2 and proved expensive to produce in the large numbers required at the time. Therefore, Soviet engineers took to designing the \"KV-85\" tank as an interim solution while a new initiative was begun under the \"KV-13\" designation.\n\r\nThe KV-13 program produced the \"IS-85\" prototype (Objekt 233) and featured a more stout armor layout, thusly increasing protection at all angles, and a heavier main gun armament. The armor was specifically designed to counter the 50mm German anti-tank gun. Her weight limit was restricted to that of the original KV-1 model to help keep the design in check. Primary armament was an 85mm D-5T series main gun fitted to a traversing turret system atop a tracked, low-profile chassis. Six double-tired wheels were afforded to each track side. The drive sprocket was at the rear with the track idler at the front. Three track return rollers assisted the top portion of the tracks. External fuel tank stores were mounted to the rear hull sides. The turret was held well-forward in the design (as in the T-34 medium tank) and sported thick, curved armor facings with some sloping. A commander's cupola was fitted along the rear left side of the turret roof. A 7.62mm DT coaxial machine gun was fitted alongside the main gun and a defensive, rear-facing DT machine gun was mounted along the rear turret wall, offset to the left side of the turret. A further DT machine gun was provided in a bow mounting. Fifty-nine 85mm projectiles were stored throughout the vehicle with 2,520 rounds of 7.62mm machine gun ammunition. Power was provided by a single V2-IS 12-cylinder engine delivering 520 horsepower. Top speed was 23 miles per hour while operational ranges were limited to just 93 miles - both values factoring in ideal conditions at that. The IS-1 was crewed by four personnel to include a driver, tank commander, gunner and loader/machine gunner.\n\r\nAfter hurried trials, the IS-85 system was accepted into serial production as the \"IS-1\" beginning in 1943. This also marked the start of the long line of successful and powerful \"Josef Stalin\" heavy tanks that would prove critical in the latter war years and even well into the Cold War. The Soviet need for capable heavy tanks was such that the KV-1 , KV-2 and KV-85 types continued to fight on through to the end of the war while the IS-1 lineage itself evolved as the war progressed.\n\r\nThe IS-1 was inevitably (and quickly) replaced by the more well-known IS-2 series and its 122mm A-19 series main guns. The IS-3 then appeared in late 1944 as an upgraded IS-2. Only 200 examples of the IS-4 followed and there was no IS-5 design. Instead, the IS-6 began an abandoned design project as did the IS-7. The line culminated in the Cold War-era IS-10 model, which marked the last of the Josef Stalin heavy tank lines as a shift to the Main Battle Tank had taken hold worldwide - making the concept of a heavy tank somewhat archaic. However, many lessons learned in the battles of World War 2 involving the IS series were put to practical use in the development of the new generation of Soviet tanks.\n\r\nOperators of the IS-1, aside from the Russians, included Slovakia, Ukraine and Belorussia.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "IS-1 / JS-1 (Josef Stalin)", "vehicle_type": "Heavy Tank Tracked Combat Vehicle"}, {"id": "6bfa878b-e14d-4b3d-8417-fb1dccca95e1", "year_model": "1939", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the aircraft took center stage in the fighting of World War 1 (1914-1918), it fell to warplanners to better assess and neutralize the threat by way of ground-based options. This eventually led to the development of some very effective solutions such as the automatic cannon. While calibers eventually grew in size throughout the subsequent decades, including those solutions developed for use in World War 2 (1939-1945), the 37mm form remained the primary small caliber choice and went on to be used in large numbers.\n\r\nIn the 1930s, Soviet authorities began a search for a modern, small-caliber air defense gun and this led to the Swedish 25mm Model 1933 by Bofors. The weapon was extensively trialed during the middle part of the decade and found to be of sound design. Being more interested in a larger-bore weapon, Soviet engineers used this knowledge to develop their own \"49-K\" of 45mm caliber but then this same weapon was reworked to become a more handier battlefield form - the \"61-K\", generically designated the \"Model 1939\". Work on the new gun took place in 1938, leading to adoption in 1939 - just in time for the fighting of World War 2.\n\r\nFor its time, the M1939 had contemporaries in the Swedish Bofors 40mm, the German 3.7cm SK C/30, the American 37mm Gun M1, and the British QF 2-Pounder (Navy).\n\r\nDuring the conflict, the gun more than proved its worth where it was especially effective against low-flying aerial threats and could be brought to bear against infantry and light-armored vehicles at range. In practice, the complete system required a complement of eight for maximum efficiency in directing, aiming, firing, and reloading tasks. The gun was fed by way of five-round clips and a total of 200 projectiles were kept ready-to-fire with the platform. Soviet gun crews went on to claim thousands of Axis-piloted aircraft through skillful use of these guns which were initially mounted atop ZU-7 carriages featuring a quadruple wheel arrangement. Lacking power, the guns were towed behind pack animals or mover vehicles as needed.\n\r\nThe gun was also fitted to a specially-designed, open-air structure and mounted atop the rear of the SU-76 Self-Propelled Gun (SPG) vehicle hull to produce a mobile air defense platform during World War 2 for the Red Army - such was its versatility.\n\r\nThe success of the land-based model inevitably led to the development of navalized forms that began with the \"70K\". These succeeded the older 21-K series guns of 45mm caliber and became the primary 37mm mounting on most all Soviet warships during the war and beyond. While production of the land-based guns ended with the war in 1945, naval guns were produced into the mid-1950s. By then, the land-based models had, themselves, succeeded the aging AZP S-60 types in the Soviet Army.\n\r\nThe \"V-11\" (also \"W-11\") was the twin-gunned version of the 70K, developed due to barrel fracturing/deforming issues when using the single barrel beyond its rated 100 rounds. These guns were introduced in 1946 and, though not produced in the same numbers as the 70K, were equally popular weapons.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "37mm M1939 (61-K)", "vehicle_type": "37mm Towed Anti-Aircraft (AA) Gun System"}, {"id": "86a15f6b-3413-4818-9c6c-19743fb08031", "year_model": "1939", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet Army became something of experts in the use of battlefield rockets during World War 2. The BM-13 series (more popularly known as \"Katyusha\", this derived from the diminutive affectionate form of \"Katya\") mounting their lethal 132mm high-explosive rockets on rudimentary launch rails, proved devastating against the heart of German Army forces and became the most widely available form of the Red Army mobile launchers. Despite her 1930s pedigree, the Katyusha can be found in various forms even today, a popular weapon system for cash-strapped militaries and insurgent forces alike. The term \"Katyusha\" also went on to form a family of similarly-minded vehicles, fitting different rocket counts on different vehicle chassis types.\n\r\nThe Katyusha was designed in the latter half of the 1930s and were only beginning to come online by the time the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941. At that time, there only a few launcher batteries available and only a small stockpile of 132mm rockets to boot. Regardless, the systems were placed into active service wherever and whenever possible to keep a fragile defense intact until production could keep pace with demand. At any rate, these weapon systems served as quite a wakeup call to the unsuspecting German Army, particularly in July of 1941 during actions at Smolensk. The Germans nicknamed the Katyusha \"Stalin's Organ\" in response to its arrangement of launch rails (mimicking the pipes of an organ) and the noise the rockets made when launched. The Katyusha was also known to some as \"Little Katy\". \n\r\nThe rockets themselves, the Rs-82 and Rs-132 series, were in development for some time prior during the 1930s. These weapons were originally intended for use aboard Soviet ground-attack aircraft and ultimately proved effective in the role. It was not until 1938 that Soviet engineers began evaluating the weapon for use by ground-based launchers. Tests revealed the rockets to be viable battlefield implements and, in 1941, the BM-13 launch truck was ordered into production. At their core, these complete Katyusha systems proved relatively cheap to produce and fast to deliver to front line components requiring such a \"shock and awe\" weapon.\n\r\nWhile rocket launching systems such as the BM-13 were largely inaccurate for direct target fire, there was no second-guessing the psychological effect  delivered from a release of large, high-explosive rockets against an enemy-held area. If properly amassed in number, a force of such vehicles could lay waste to swathes of enemy-occupied territory and, as such, accuracy proved of little importance in the long run. The end result was usually a dead (or shaken) enemy and a wasteland of debris where trees and structures once stood.\n\r\nThe concept behind the BM-13 was quite simple, it consisting generally of a six-wheeled all-wheel drive truck chassis with a forward-mounted engine and crew compartment followed by the fixed launch rail system itself on a rear-set flatbed. A hydraulic lift elevated the forward portion of the launcher - up to 45-degrees - and interestingly no traverse was afforded on initial models. This meant that the entire vehicle had to be positioned towards the target area. The weapon, as a whole, relied on basic ballistic trajectory that itself relied on adjustments to the firing arc by the crew.\n\r\nIn their early forms, BM-13s were set upon the chassis of the Soviet ZiS-6 - a 6x6, six-wheeled utility truck that was modified to include a 16-rocket launch system. These vehicles fell under the formal designation of BM-13-16. The ZiS-6 offered adequate off-road and on-road capabilities and could reach virtually any battlefield location that a tank or other like-vehicle could. This meant she could participate alongside offensive actions - though most often from behind the direct front line - and launch her deadly salvo before the rush of the initial attack began. Such was the value of these early systems as a weapon to the Soviet Army that measures were taken to ensure their locations were kept secret. Tarps were utilized to shroud their appearance from low-flying enemy reconnaissance aircraft and only proven members (usually Soviet Secret Service - NKVD) of the Communist Party were enlisted to operate Katyushas within the ranks of the Red Army. First actions for BM-13s occurred on July 14th, 1941 in assaults against German Army troops and vehicles.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "BM-8 / BM-13 / BM-31 (Katyusha)", "vehicle_type": "Multiple Launch Rocket System"}, {"id": "c7d2220a-1839-4f03-95f3-f06214f2b4af", "year_model": "1939", "description": "\r\n        \tTo stave off defeat at the hands of the Germans in World War 2 (1939-1945), the Soviet Union was forced to rely on a bevy of artillery pieces of various calibers. One of the more famous of the available lot became the \"M-30\" (M1938) series of towed divisional-level field howitzers which went on to enjoy a long service life, its production totals reaching 19,266 units before the end. The design of the gun was attributed to the Motovilikha Plants and manufacture was under Plant No. 9 and Plant No.92 of the Soviet Union from the period spanning 1939 until 1955. Despite its age, the series continues to see service today (2017) and is regarded as one of the best artillery guns of the 20th Century.\n\r\nThe gun, of 122mm caliber (121.92mm to be more precise), was already in circulation before the time of World War 2. It was a conventionally-arranged artillery piece consisting of the gun tube with recoil mechanism, gun shield, twin-wheeled carriage with mounting hardware and split-trail tow arms. The gun tube sat at front-center with the hydropneumatic system underneath. Both were affixed to the mounting section and this to the carriage assembly. The allotted gun shield offered only limited protection to the gunnery crew of eight. The breech involved an interrupted screw-type design with automatic case ejection system and sighting was through an panoramic device. The roadwheels allowed for road travel with an accompanying mover vehicle and the trail arms were split apart when the weapon was made ready to fire.\n\r\nThe mounting hardware allowed for an elevation span of -3 to 63.5 degrees and traversal was +49 degrees left-right from centerline. This gave the weapon the capabilities of direct and in-direct fire. Range was out to 7.3 miles. A trained, well-experienced gunnery crew could reach a rate-of-fire of up to 6 rounds-per-minute.\n\r\nDimensions of the complete system included an overall length of 19.3 feet and a width of 6.5 feet. Overall weight was 5,400lb when the system was made ready-to-fire though this ballooned to 6,835lb when the gun was arranged for transport.\n\r\nIn 1940, some 639 total pieces were produced for immediate action and production peaked in 1944 with another 3,485 guns added to the mix. In the final year of the war, 1945, a further 2,630 more guns were included and manufacture consistently fell from there, ending in 1955.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "M-30 (Model 1938)", "vehicle_type": "122mm Towed Field Howitzer"}, {"id": "69f022d0-f928-443b-913a-7e6b0c37f237", "year_model": "1918", "description": "\r\n        \tFrom the period of 1918 to 1920, the British-originated Austin Armored Car (detailed elsewhere on this site) was constructed for the Russian Empire and became locally known as the \"Austin-Putilov\". These vehicles emerged from a 1916 commitment to fielding a local armored car for Russian Army service during World War 1 (1914-1918). Since Russian industry lacked the capabilities to generate such a product from scratch, some sixty Austin Car chassis (with engines) were purchased from the Austin Motor Company to provide the basic foundation for the machine. The Putilov Works of St. Petersburg was charged with manufacture and installation of their armored hull components and production was set to begin as soon as possible. However, the February Revolution of 1917 did much to hurt the Russian war effort and work on the type was delayed for a time. Instead of the planned 1917 fielding date, the first cars were not available until 1918. From there, thirty-three total cars were delivered.\n\r\nAs built, the Putilov cars had a running length of 4.9 meters with a width of 2 meters and height of 2.8 meters. Weight was 5.2 tons. The crew numbered five and included the driver, commander, a loader-mechanic and a pair of dedicated machine gunners. Power was from an Austin 4-cylinder gasoline fueled engine of 50 horsepower providing road speeds of up to 34 miles per hour and operational ranges out to 125 miles. Armament was typically 2 x 7.62mm Maxim machine guns and approximately 5,000 rounds were carried - the vehicle was more an anti-infantry measure than anything else. The guns were fitted in two individual rotating, cylindrical turrets set over the rear section of the hull roof. Off-road travel was aided somewhat by use of a 2x4 leaf spring suspension system but the Putilov car was no off-road warrior. Armor protection reached up to 7.5mm thickness and riveted over the bow, driving compartment and rear section.

The Mk I was followed by the trainer-minded Tank Mk II which was pressed into combat and the dedicated trainer Tank Mk III models before arrival of the definitive Tank Mk IV combat-centric landship. Such vehicles were critical in breaking the trench warfare stalemates that arose along the Western Front during World War 1 and would become the centerpiece of national armies in the decades following the conflict. \n\r\nThe Tank Mk V incorporated several improvements over previous British landships yet it retained the general rhomboidal shape common to many of these early engineering efforts. The vehicle was crewed by no fewer than eight personnel and main armament was managed through two side sponson assemblies as in earlier marks. Armor protection was 16mm at its thickest (front) with 12mm allocated to the sides. The Tank Mk V was more or less a direct improved form of the preceding Tank Mk IV line of 1917 with an integrated communications system, commander's cupola and drive controls to managed by one person (as opposed to the four required of earlier types). As in the Tank Mk IV series, the Tank Mk V line was also produced in two distinct forms - \"Male\" and \"Female\". Male versions carrier cannon armament and machine guns while Female versions were given solely machine guns for the defense of the Males - this in line with armored warfare doctrine of the day.\n\r\nManufacture of Tank Mk V systems produced some 400 examples of which 200 were built exclusively as males and 200 as females. As with previous British tanks, there also existed half-male/half-female conversions of these variants that incorporated a cannon-armed sponson on one hull side and a machine gun-only-armed sponson on the other. Manufacture was handled by the Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon company beginning in late-1917. The initial production batch tanks arrived at the frontlines in May of 1918.\n\r\nWith Tank Mk Vs now available in number for 1918, they were put into combat at the Battle of Hamel on July 4th, 1918. Hamel lay in northern German-held France and the battle brought about use of Tank V tanks. A combined force of Australians and Americans attacked German defensive positions with rather modern tactics which helped to ensure an Allied victory. 2,000 Germans were killed and 1,600 taken prisoner against 976 Allied service members killed and 338 wounded. The battle showcased the tank as a centerpiece instrument with extensive support from Australian artillery and British bombers. The battle also served to streamline the usefulness of tanks in modern warfare whereas in previous encounters, commanders were still deciding on the maximum value of the \"landship\" in the grand scope of the war. Incidentally, the Tank Mk V became the first landship to be made available to American forces in the European theater.\n\r\nA typical \"Male\" Tank Mk V was armed with 2 x QF 57mm (6-pounder) main guns held in side sponsons. The side sponson approach (as opposed to use of a more conventional \"turret\") was selected due to the attack angles needed to engage targets down in a trench (a turret would have had limited downward attack angles). Males were also fielded with up to 4 x 7.7mm (.303) Hotchkiss Mk 1 machine guns. Females were simply armed with 6 x 7.7mm Hotchkiss machine guns and their role was to defend the Male tanks from infantry attack. As such, two females were typically fielded with every one male so all engagement arcs could be covered from enemy attack.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Tank Mk V", "vehicle_type": "Heavy Tank / Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV)"}, {"id": "2f5317d6-09c4-45d1-b99c-3239ecdca983", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Canon de 155 C modele 1917 Schneider was a standardized French Army heavy field howitzer receiving its baptism of fire in World War 1, seeing extensive combat service in World War 2 and made its way to several major world military inventories including that of the United States and Imperial Russia / Soviet Union. The weapon was born of the earlier M1915 series guns that were forced to evolve with the changing requirements of war during World War 1. Amazingly, some modern foreign units still train on their trusty M1917 guns for the weapon went on to see widespread circulation particularly after the First World War. \n\r\nOrigins of the M1917 lay in the preceding M1915 design. The M1915, known formally as the \"Canon de 155 C modele 1915 Schneider\", was (as its designation suggests) adopted in 1915 through the French Army. The M1915 was, itself, based on a previous Schneider design centered around a 152mm projectile. The M1915 was chambered for a massive 155mm projectile and the entire system constituted the barrel, breech with hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism and gun shield mounted to a wheeled carriage, the latter to facilitate transport by pack animal (as many as eight horses were required). The weapon operated through an interrupted screw-type breech opening to which was fed the shell and then the separate brass cartridge case containing the propellant charge. Operational range was 2,700 yards which categorized the M1915 as long-range artillery in French Army service.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Canon de 155 C modele 1917 Schneider", "vehicle_type": "Heavy Field Howitzer"}, {"id": "071a6bba-8007-4a9f-bdbe-fe181b2c00c4", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Renault FT-17 series of light tank was an evolutionary design in the field of combat tanks that would go on to influence tanks for nearly a century. The FT-17 was designed from the outset to be of a lightweight classification which offered better mobility and road speed than its lumbering medium and heavy tank counterparts. The FT-17 brought into play two crucial design elements that are still utilized in tank design today - fully-rotating turret concentrating main armament (turrets appeared in both cast and welded forms) and an engine mounted to the rear of the hull.\n\r\nThe FT-17 came about, in part, through the persistence of French Army Colonel Jean-Baptiste Estienne. The idea of fielding light-class tanks in World War 1 was something of a \"nonsense\" theory with French authorities, the accepted doctrine being on use of the large and lumbering \"landships\" developed by the British as heavy tanks - roaming fortresses outfitted with cannon and machine gun. Regardless, the resulting Renault light tank design, the FT-17 of 1917,  produced a two-man system mounting a then-potent 37mm cannon or one or two anti-infantry 7.62mm machine guns for self-defense. The FT-17, on the surface, was as much a unique military tank design as it was in reflecting the appearance of a child's life-size riding toy due to its compact form and utilitarian appearance.\n\r\nNevertheless, the FT-17 proved crucial to French offensives in the latter years of the war and this importance spread to the American Expeditionary Force who were handed both French and British tanks as their participation increased into 1918. The Americans even adopted the FT-17 as the M1917 6-Ton and outfitted it with American-minded systems for ease of logistics. The FT-17 series was fielded from the spring of 1917 onwards though the type would not see direct operational combat until the offensives of 1918.\n\r\nThe FT-17 proved a highly capable armored tracked combat system, so much so that it continued in an operational level into the post-war years. Beyond the French and American adoption, the FT-17 was also inducted into the inventories of the Italians and Russians and these went on to inspire localized forms to be developed - thusly influencing a long line of foreign tanks used throughout 1920 and into 1930. Other notable operators included Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Iran, Japan and Poland. Sadly for some host nations of the 1930s, the FT-17 (or its derivatives) was still an active part of their defense and offense during the time of the Spanish Civil War (1935-1939) and World War 2 (1939-1945).\n\r\nLarge production orders during and following World War 1 ensured the legacy of the system for decades since its inception. Final forms were retired in the late 1940s to which 3,694 examples were produced by then. One of the last major recorded uses of FT-17 tanks was in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War - a modern battlefield to feature a World War 1-era tank development.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Renault FT-17", "vehicle_type": "Light Tank"}, {"id": "e102e0a6-4691-472f-b5ab-c64e98d64afa", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThe \"Technical\" is a generic name given to make-shift military vehicles crudely developed on the chassis of existing 4x4 all-wheel drive civilian-minded vehicles - typically seen as a flatbed pickup truck whose driving cabin is the only obstruction for any trainable weapon installed over the rear section. Technicals are low-cost options for low-budget militaries and militia groups requiring mobile firepower and provide a fast-attack capability against both established forces and lesser foes. Such vehicles serve well for local intimidation, as reconnaissance mounts, and in the ambush role where their weaponry can be quickly brought to bear on unsuspecting targets. The versatility of the platform is only limited by the imagination of the fighting force and the tolerances of the chassis in play. Throughout history, Technicals have been fitted with an array of light-to-medium-class military hardware - rocket projectors (in the MLRS role), heavy machine guns, medium machine guns, recoilless rifles, and complete Anti-Aircraft (AA) cannon systems being just some examples. The usual inherent four-wheel drive functionality allows for a certain level of off-road performance though this is sometimes hampered by the weight of the combat equipment installed. Additionally, Technicals usually forgo armor protection and supply very little survivability to its crew.\n\r\nThe modern day form of the Technical emerged from the fighting in Somalia during the early 1990s. However, such improvised vehicles saw their origins much earlier during the fighting of World War 1 (1914-1918) where standard civilian-minded chassis (truck or car) were modified as roving ground attack vehicles through installation of weapons and armor plating. In some cases, the results were viable war machines but, in others, the vehicles were too heavy for off-road use and clumsy to wield in action thanks to their high profiles. Nevertheless, the low-cost option allowed warplanners an edge over less technically-advanced foes though, on a modern battlefield against a technically superior enemy, Technicals have proven poor battle wagons that offer little tactical value. The Technical evolved throughout the interwar years since The Great War and saw additional work on their kind during the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945) - particularly in far-off places where soldiers had to make do with what was available to them.\n\r\nFrom the Cold War onwards, Technicals have proven ever-popular for both regular and irregular forces across the African continent and the Middle East region of the world where utility trucks have proven readily available - these vehicles usually combined with old stocks of Soviet- or American-originated weaponry as available. Special forces operatives and mercenaries alike have also come to rely on the Technical through their own work in these regions. Iraqi police were issued a Toyota-based Technical as their ranks were rebuilt following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and Syrian rebels in the ongoing Syrian Civil War (2011-Present) have heavily, and continually, relied on the Technical in their march against the Assad-led government.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Technical", "vehicle_type": "Wheeled Improvised Fighting Vehicle (IFV)"}, {"id": "b8461ec3-4c11-4603-9052-92dcafdb6e71", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer was developed during World War 1 and was still in service at the beginning of World War 2. These weapons fired an unbelievable 22.4 million projectiles during their tenure in the Great War and served as one of the most respected and important weapons available to the British war effort during the conflict. Approximately 3,633 examples were completed in whole and these were produced from a combined effort from British factories that included Vickers, Beardmore, Coventry Ordnance Works, Woolwich Ordnance Factory and Midvale Steel Company. The type went on to see additional action in the early years of World War 2 before being formally declared as obsolete in 1945.\n\r\nWorld war found Europe in beginning on July 28th, 1914. Exactly a month earlier, regional tensions boiled over after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria - in line to the throne of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire - by nineteen year old Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip. The assassination triggered Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia and other loyalties were soon following in declaring war against another's allies. Such began the Great War.\n\r\nBritish Empire forces were pressed into service and brought with them whatever they had available - among these were obsolete 6-inch 25 cwt and 6-inch 30 cwt medium howitzer systems. While relatively still effective, these systems were nonetheless past their prime  - the 6-inch 30 cwt weapon was itself forged in the late 1800s. As such, there proved a dire need to develop a more modernized form of the base field gun for British artillery elements. The 6-inch 30 cwt was, therefore, devised as a replacement for both aging field guns, offering an all-new design that promoted such qualities as mobility, improved ranges and lethal firepower. Design work on the 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer began in January of 1915 and fire trials followed in late July. The weapon proved sufficient for British needs and the type was entered into operational service in August.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "6-Inch 26 cwt", "vehicle_type": "Towed Medium Howitzer"}, {"id": "26ba173d-66ce-4887-9dac-c5fcc4bcfc69", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian Empire Izhorsky Mgebrov-Renault was one of the more unique developments of armored car to appear in World War 1 (1914-1918). The design was from the mind of Russian Army Captain Mgebrov and built atop an existing French Renault chassis with assembly handled at the Izhorsky Plant (hence the three-name designation of \"Izhorsky Mgebrov-Renault\"). The key characteristic of the vehicle was its heavily-sloped frontal section which led to a flat superstructure roof over the rear. At this position was fitted machine gun armament with an unfettered 360-degree view of the surrounding action. Original vehicles were crewed by four - a driver, commander and two machine gunners. Original vehicles were also heavy with armor at 3.4 tons while a later redesigned model emerged with improved performance as a 2.75-ton vehicle. With two prototypes setting the foundation for the line, about eleven total Izhorsky Mgebrov-Renault cars were eventually manufactured. The revised versions were still undergoing their conversion process during the Russian Revolution of 1917 - the event marking the beginning of the end for the Russian Empire and the birth of the Soviet Union.\n\r\nThe Izhorsky Mgebrov-Renault car was the result of testing undertaken by Captain Mgebrov into the value of sloped armor versus traditionally-accepted flat panels. Sloping meant inherent ballistics protection with far less armor required to cover an area though this sort of protection was only really achieved at certain angles so experimentation was key. For expediency, the general configuration of the Renault car was retained and this included the driver's position established at midships and the engine compartment at front. This allowed the rear section of the chassis to be fitted with the gun tub and its corresponding 2 x machine gun armament (7.62mm Vickers or Maxim types were used). The original vehicle design held a three-turret arrangement and drive power came from the original Renault 14HP series 4-cylinder, air-cooled engine of 30 horsepower. This drove just one of the axle sets. As can be expected with the superstructure armor, armament and ammunition in place, the vehicle was a slow, plodding instrument with terrible battlefield performance - reaching a paltry 12 miles per hour on ideal road surfaces.\n\r\nIn 1916, the vehicle was redesigned in an effort to exact maximum performance gains from the chassis at the expense of armor protection. The triple-turret arrangement was abandoned and, in its place, a two-turret configuration adopted instead. Engineers then stripped some of the armor thickness at \"lower-risk\" facings to help lightened the vehicle's road operating weight. With the same engine in place, the car could now reach upwards of 34 miles per hour on road while also alleviating stresses placed on the chassis components. Conversion work then spanned into 1917 before the Russian Revolution disrupted work for a time.\n\r\nBeyond their service in World War 1, Izhorsky Mgebrov-Renault cars fell into use by both the Red and White sides of the ensuing Russian Civil War. Following the conflict, the remaining stock of vehicles managed an existence into the 1930s to which they were then given up for good in the face of new, more modern Soviet designs heading into World War 2 (1939-1945).\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Izhorsky Mgebrov-Renault", "vehicle_type": "Armored Car"}, {"id": "c9f127f3-f81a-4100-8d03-d2bfe5e6b230", "year_model": "1915", "description": "Lanchester Motor Company - United Kingdom", "vehicle_name": "Lanchester Armored Car (4x2)", "vehicle_type": "Wheeled Fighting Vehicle"}, {"id": "217813f7-700d-4f70-96a8-0bba93551ed7", "year_model": "1915", "description": "Vickers-Armstrong - UK", "vehicle_name": "Ordnance QF 2-Pounder (Pom-Pom)", "vehicle_type": "Anti-Aircraft (AA) Cannon"}, {"id": "574820fb-732f-489b-8def-568822c4d553", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tsar Tank was an extraordinary - though ultimately failed - feat of Russian combat engineering that attempted to create a capable mobile weapons platform able to cross any terrain before it. The system was born during the fighting of World War 1 (1914-1918) to which, in the East, pitted the Russian Empire against the forces of the German Empire and its allies. The Tsar Tank was not a combat tank in the traditional sense as it relied on a tricycle wheeled configuration that utilized two large main wheels set ahead of a smaller pivoting steering system. The frontal wheels - heavily spoked as if wheels on a bicycle - were joined by a single axle between them with extending arms connecting them to the main vehicle body. Along this main body was held the powerplant, fuel stores, and crew compartments as well as armament and ammunition. The design was attributed to Nikolai Lebedenko and Alexander Mikulin - the vehicle sometimes referred to as the \"Lebedenko Tank\" - and work spanned from 1914 to 1915.\n\r\nThe combat tank of World War 1 was primarily characterized by the lozenge-shaped designs of the British with armament held in side sponsons while it was the French that introduced a capable turreted-armament tank in their Renault FT-17 Light Tank series. Both initiatives held their value on the battlefields of World War 1 and proved instrumental from 1917 onwards in breaking the stalemate of trench warfare that had come to dominate Europe by the end of 1914. The Tsar Tank was a grand departure from both of these measures as its primary intent was to easily traverse uneven terrain using large-diameter (27 foot) wheels with the rear of the system brought along by a wheel set measuring just 5 feet high. The lead wheels were each powered by a Sunbeam-brand engine of 250 horsepower output. Armament-wise, the Tsar Tank concentrated its cannon across three turres. There was a main traversable turret emplacement at center along the roof with its firing arc largely obstructed by the forward wheels. A cannon was also added to each side sponson mounted outboard of the forward wheels and these also held limited firing arcs. It is assumed that machine guns were also meant to be carried for defense against infantry attacks though it is doubtful that the Tsar Tank would ever be fielded without support from armored cars or accompanying tanks.\n\r\nThe shortcomings of the Tsar Tank were quickly brought to light in testing during 1915. Though the large diameter front wheels proved capable of traversing many terrain types, it was the smaller rear section that did the vehicle in. The peculiar design of the vehicle placed an inordinate amount of weight at the rear unit which ended with the vehicle becoming bogged down in the terrain. The sheer mass of the vehicle, and the ensuing political instability emerging from the Russian revolution, was such that no additional effort was made to recover the vehicle until after the war in 1923. Even then, the Tsar Tank was far from reconstituted for additional testing and simply scrapped for its valuable metal - ending the reign of the Tsar Tank in full.\n\r\nDue to its distinct shape when viewed from above - this resembling the profile of a bat handing upside down, the Tsar Tank was also known as the \"Netopyr\", translating to \"pipistrellus\", the genus name for bat.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Tsar Tank (Lebedenko Tank / Netopyr)", "vehicle_type": "Mobile Weapons Platform"}, {"id": "3946e83f-7546-4c3f-b190-5c0a4d6c7ced", "year_model": "1914", "description": "\r\n        \tThe armored car prove its military value during the fighting of World War 1 (1914-1918) where mechanized forces were just beginning to find their place on the battlefield. Such vehicles offered mobile firing platforms and armored scouting services and able to affect any one given engagement of the conflict. While indispensible as they seemingly were, many of the early armored cars were simply built upon existing, civilian-minded, commercial automotive chassis that were never truly sound for frontline military service, particularly across uneven terrain while carrying the added weight from armor, armament and ammunition.\n\r\nWith the assassination of Austrian Archduke Ferdinand of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in June of 1914, Europe mobilized for war as long-standing alliances were brought into play. Among these was the Russian Empire who aligned with Serbia against Austria-Hungary and Germany and, in response, the Russians moved on forming their own mechanized armored corps stocked with armored cars for the war years ahead.\n\r\nHowever, such a commitment soon found that Russian industrial infrastructure lacked the capacity to produce the vehicles needed. It was decided that Russian authorities would be sent abroad in the hopes of finding an armored car design suitable for use by its military forces and  the search led to Britain where, in response, the Austin Motor Company moved to fulfill the Russian Army requirement and took a civilian car chassis, applied the needed military components and presented the product for review. In September of 1914, the Russians ordered the first 48 cars of what were known as the \"Austin 1st Series\".\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Austin Armored Car (Series)", "vehicle_type": "Reconnaissance Vehicle"}, {"id": "eca91164-b761-4e50-aa46-0d6987ae0f39", "year_model": "1914", "description": "\r\n        \tLike other armored cars of World War 1 (1914-1918), the Belgian Minerva Armored Car was a hastily-generated mobile machine gun platform based on an existing civilian market automobile chassis and forced into battlefield service at the outbreak of war. The cars marked the first deployment of armored car types in the conflict and the other national powers quickly followed suit - though still depending heavily on cavalry for main offensive charges. The Minerva Armored Car was officially known as the \"Auto Mitrailleuse Minerva\" - or \"AMM\".\n\r\nThe original armored car design approach was attributed to one Lieutenant Charles Henkart and two vehicles were converted through the Cockerill Works at Hoboken for the role by having armor plating attached all around the existing framework. The work was completed in 1914 and a total of thirty-five vehicles were completed before the German advance through Belgium into France during the opening offensive of the conflict.\n\r\nThe cars retained their general civilian form with their long wheelbase and forward engine compartment. The driver position remained at front-right (complete with vision port) and an armored superstructure was erected over the driver's compartment and passenger seating area at the rear. Thickness of the armor was up to 4mm and the vehicles weighed some four tons. Dimensionally the cars had a length of 4.9 meters, a width of 1.75 meters, and a height of 2.3 meters. Their length and wheelbase dictated a wide turn radius and the added weight over the rear axle forced a second tire to be added to each side while a spare was carried over the rear platform.\n\r\nDrive power was through an in-house Minerva 8L series, 4-cylinder gasoline-fueled engine of 40 horsepower which allowed for a maximum road speed of 25 miles-per-hour. Cross-country travel was possible, though severely restricted, due to the vehicle's weight and fragile nature. Operational ranges reached 90 miles.\n\r\nThe standard operating crew was four with an additional three personnel (typically sharpshooters) carried for a full combat complement. Armament became a sole 8mm Hotchkiss Model 1909/1912/1914 air-cooled machine gun fitted over the rear section in an open-air compartment. A gunshield provided some protection for the operator. Other members of the crew could engage enemies with their own personal weapons as needed.\n\r\nIn practice, the cars were attached to existing cavalry units and generally operated in groups of three to provide useful firing arcs for the machine guns. Their role included such sorties as scouting and general reconnaissance where their mechanized nature allowed them to meander behind the enemy front lines to help collect information on strength, movement, and positions. They were also relatively protected - though only up to small arms fire as a nearby artillery strike could utterly destroy the vehicle in short order. The cars proved hugely useful in the early-going when the war was fluid but saw reduced value once the Western Front bogged down into a trench-versus-trench slugfest (which, in turn, pushed the development of the \"tank\"). During 1916, the vehicles were revised with an enclosed fighting compartment which also included a better-protected machine gun position. A handful of cars fell to the Germans during the fighting and these were reconstituted back into service to be used against their former owners.\n\r\nThe last Minerva Armored Cars were removed from Belgian service in 1935.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Minerva Armored Car", "vehicle_type": "Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV)"}, {"id": "8f185abd-b605-4ba9-9477-b245e51838d6", "year_model": "1914", "description": "\r\n        \tLike most other world powers in World War 1 (1914-1918), the mechanized side of the Russian Army during the conflict largely centered on armored cars. The Putilov-Garford Armored Car was one such example and consistent with designs of the times - an armor superstructure developed atop the chassis of an existing vehicle. In this case, it was the American-originated, 4x2 wheeled, 5-ton class Garford Motor truck. Because of its origins in a civilian-minded machine, the Putilov-Garford design ultimately suffered what most World War 1 cars suffered from - limited performance brought about by an underpowered engine. Cross-country performance was also poor with wheels holding a tendency to sink into soft terrain under the weight of guns, armor, and crew. Power was through the original Garford 4-cylinder, air-cooled, gasoline-fueled engine of 30 horsepower which allowed for road speeds of just over 10 miles per hour and operational ranges out to 75 miles.\n\r\nThe Russians experimented with various armament fits for the truck during initial testing and settled on a 76mm field gun for maximum hitting power at range. This was seated in a limited-traverse and elevation emplacement over the rear of the truck. The armored hull superstructure was developed by NM Fiatov and made up of steel sheets. Some sections were sloped for basic ballistics deflection while others were left more vulnerable vertical faces. Thickness at given points measured up to 6.5mm which offered protection against small arms fire and artillery spray. The crew numbered five and included the driver and commander seated at the front of the vehicle with the engine. Vision ports allowed for some situational awareness and pistol ports allowed for the pair to engage outside entities. A roof hatch provided some observation capabilities for the commander at the risk of catching a sniper's bullet. The remainder of the crew consisted of the main gunner and two machine gunners. A 7.62mm Vickers machine gun was offset to the right side of the 76mm gun over the rear and side sponsons each contained a 7.62mm machine gun. 5,000 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition could be carried into action.\n\r\nThe vehicle weighed 8.5 tons and held dimensions of 5.7 meters long, 2.3 meters wide, and 2.8 meters tall. As the armored superstructure sat on the already-tall truck chassis, this gave the Putilov-Garford model a very high profile for a combat vehicle - much to the chagrin of the operating crew.\n\r\nProduction from the Putilov Factory totaled some 48 units from the period spanning 1916 to 1918. The Russian Navy also ordered the type for local defense through a multiple-vehicle batch order and these varied slightly from their Army counterparts. As many as five of the Russian cars were believed to be captured and reconstituted for service by the German Army along the East Front and these remained in service for a time after the war for local security. A few also fell to the Poles. Russian use of the Putilov-Garford system continued into the post-war years where they were featured in the Russian Civil War.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "Putilov-Garford Armored Car", "vehicle_type": "Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV)"}, {"id": "be4031c7-78e6-43ce-aded-8c8547235cbb", "year_model": "1912", "description": "\r\n        \tIn 1912, the United States Army began evaluation of an all-new, four-wheel-driven truck for military service. The truck was based on a 1908 design (known as the \"Battleship\") which born in Clintonville, Wisconsin and promoted a more practical four-wheel drive arrangement. than offerings seen previously. The Four-Wheel Drive Auto Company (FWD Corporation in 1958) focused on manufacturing trucks on this new driving principle and one of its emerging products became the \"Model B\" 3-ton which eventually proved itself a sound vehicle for the rigors of military use through two World Wars.\n\r\nDesign of the Model B was wholly utilitarian by appearance, though keeping with the period as far as automobiles and trucks went. It consisted of an engine and passenger section along the forward section of the chassis which, itself, was given four, rubber-tired road wheels. The passengers sat on bench seating with the primary control apparatus being a traditional steering wheel. The occupants sat notably high in the design with rather commanding views due to the placement of the engine. A cover overhead for the crew was optional and a grille at the front of the cab gave the Model B a unique, identifiable appearance. The rear section of the frame could be fitted with a cargo box and to this could be added a canvas cover to protect supplies from the elements. With the canvas affixed, the vehicle appeared as something akin to a mechanized stagecoach from the American Wild West.\n\r\nBy the time of World War 1 (1914-1918), motorized vehicles were already valued for their hauling capabilities and all manner of types were utilized by all sides - some even pressed as armored cars featuring weaponry.

The former was the first Russian gun available in 76.2mm caliber and incorporated a recoil mechanism for accurized repeat-fire capabilities. Then followed the Model 1902, a divisional-level field gun which offered more modern elements and greater battlefield performance/effectiveness than the earlier design. The M1902 went on to supersede the M1900 series as the M1900 began a process of being handed down to Soviet-supported nations and states. Production of M1902 guns spanned from 1903 until 1931 and these saw combat service in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), World War 1 (1914-1918), the Russian Revolution (1917) (and the internal strife that followed), and were available in various model forms by the time of World War 2 (1939-1945).\n\r\nLike the M1900 before it, the M1902 was of a conventional design and arrangement for the period. It featured solid, heavily-spoked road wheels and a fixed trail carriage. The recoil mechanism was integral as was the elevation and traverse hardware. Elevation spans reached from -3 to +17 degrees (greater than that as seen on the M1900 series) and traversal was +5 degrees left-to-right from centerline. Rate-of-fire could reach up to 12 rounds-per-minute and maximum reaches were out to 5.28 miles (about equivalent to the preceding M1900 design). A rectangular gun shield was fitted ahead of the breech (which was of an interrupted screw design) and the piece's combat weight was 1,095 kilograms. When set up to travel, the gun weighed 2,380 kilograms requiring use of animals or mover vehicles for long-distance transportation.\n\r\nAfter the Russian Revolution was over and things had settled somewhat, thought was given to modernizing the existing stocks of M1900 and M1902 pieces. In 1930 work began to bring these systems to a more viable fighting form as new barrels and new ammunition was introduced. Both the M1900 and M1902 were modernized under the new collective designation of \"Model 02/30\" and formed the primary light artillery piece of the Soviet Army heading into World War 2.\n\r\nAs such, the aging weapon was in play during the German invasion of the Soviet Union through \"Operation Barbarossa\" in June of 1941 and this saw large stocks of these guns fall into enemy hands amidst the German advance on Moscow. The Germans, all too eager to strengthen and defend their holds, redesignated these captured systems as 76.2cm FK 295/1(r) and 76.2cm FK 295/2(r) - the difference in designations lay in the original, shorter L/30 length barrels and the newer, longer L/40 length barrels. German use of these guns constituted second-line roles and many were featured along the famed \"Atlantic Wall\".\n\r\nDespite this setback, the guns continued in their form and function throughout the grand war. Its availability was such that thousands were still in circulation in the post-war years and fielded by lesser armies still requiring a low-cost, readily available field piece.

This particular field gun was developed during 1900 and was formally adopted under the rather-appropriate  designation of \"M1900\" (\"Model of 1900\"). The M1900 became the first Russian artillery piece in the 76.2mm caliber which became a popular Soviet Army standard by World War 2 (1939-1945) and was also the first artillery system in Russian military history to feature an integrated recoil mechanism allowing for more accurate repeat-fire capabilities.\n\r\nMany facets of the M1900 were conventional for the period - a two-wheeled fixed trail carriage was used which featured solid tires and a multi-spoked rim design. The mounting cradle for the weapon incorporated the recoil system, which used oil/India-rubber rings, and the breech was of an interrupted screw. Mounting hardware at the base of the barrel allowed for an elevation span of -6 to +11 degrees and traversal of 2.5 degrees left-to-right from centerline. Combat weight was 2,200 pounds which required mover animals or vehicles for long-distance transport. Effective firing ranges reached 4.6 miles while maximum ranges could peak at 5.28 miles.\n\r\nSerial production was set to come out of St Petersburg. In 1904, the Russo-Japanese War began which ran until 1905 and this pressed available M1900 stocks into battle. The guns gave good service in the conflict and often outmatched their rival pieces through performance. Despite this advantage, the war became a humiliating defeat for the Russians and ended with the Treaty of Portsmouth.\n\r\nThe M1900 remained in frontline service by the time of the Russian involvement in World War 1 (1914-1918) though by now the guns were themselves becoming increasingly outmatched by contemporaries. Regardless, the Russian Army required all manner of war-making goods and the availability of the M1900 series fit the need though stocks were slowly reduced as the war progressed - particularly due to the arrival of the more modern M1902 series. During its frontline use, the M1900 was regarded as an effective weapon with little flare about it. Russian elements went to war against the Germans in 1914 but were out of the conflict in 1917 due to growing internal strife - the Communist Revolution ultimately led to the collapse of the Russian Empire, the M1900 series guns notably used by both sides of the conflict.\n\r\nWith the rise of the Soviet Empire in the early 1920s, the guns finally went to supported nations either through donation or direct sale. This period ended the widespread use of the M1900 as the major powers now looked to upgrade aging weapons during the Interwar years that preceded World War 2 - now leaving smaller global players with what were once frontline quality weapons.\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "76mm Gun Model 1900 (M1900)", "vehicle_type": "Towed Field Gun"}, {"id": "2bdfe9a7-c65d-4ff9-9dce-5475420850d5", "year_model": "1877", "description": "\r\n        \tLike other global powers that committed to World War 1 (1914-1918), the Imperial Russian Army went into battle with many weapons from another century. Such was the case with pressing the 42-Line Field Gun Model of 1877 (M1877) in combat - the weapon being a  4.2-inch (106.7mm) system with physical features akin to artillery pieces of the Napoleon battlefields. The type was originally a Krupp product of Germany and first examples emerged from German factories before serial production was handled by the Obuhov Factory in Russia itself.\n\r\nThe gun tube sat on its mounting hardware in the usual way and this hardware was affixed atop a two-wheeled, heavily-spoked carriage system to be towed. Overall weight of the system was 2,675 pounds with a barrel measuring two meters long. The gun was modern to some extent as it utilized a horizontal breech-loading arrangement in which projectile and charge were sent through the breech as opposed to \"down the muzzle\". The wheeled carriage assembly allowed for some base mobility by the crew when fine tuning the shot and furthermore promoted ease of transport when affixed to a vehicle or \"beast of burden\". Outgoing shells left the muzzle at a velocity of 1,350 feet-per-second and maximum firing ranges peaked at 5,800 yards when using the standard 27.5lb High-Explosive (HE) shell.\n\r\nDue to the nature of the static fronts that soon developed across during World War 1, it became important for armies to invest heavily in in-direct fire weapons such as mortars and howitzers which allowed gunnery crews to \"drop\" explosive and fragmentation shells down upon enemy positions. The key limitation of the M1877 system was its design for \"line-of-sight\" firing which limited its tactical usefulness on the evolving battlefield - the exiting projectile maintained a relatively flat trajectory by design. As a result, the weapon found better use in the later Russian involvement as a static fixture in fortified positions along Russian shores, protecting vital sea lanes from enemy forces where the direct fire nature of the Model 1877 could give the gun better value.\n\r\nThe weapons were in circulation longer than expected and some were taken over by the neighboring Finns during 1918. These went on to see considerably longer service lives for their final shots were not recorded until March 1940 during the Finnish-Soviet war - known as the \"Winter War\" (1939-1940) - as part of the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945).\r\n\t\t", "vehicle_name": "42-Line Field Gun Model 1877", "vehicle_type": "107mm Breech-loaded, Towed Field Gun"}], "aircraft": [{"id": "5e578e24-6efd-4aa6-8f8f-7c6e8cc63617", "year_model": "2032", "description": "\r\n        \tRussia is moving ahead with the design phase of a new subsonic strategic stealth bomber to succeed the aging lines of Tu-95 \"Bear\" and T-160 \"Blackjack\" conventional Cold War-era long-range bombers - which are seeing modernization as an interim measure. The new bomber will be headed by the storied Tupolev concern (of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC)) which designed, developed and produced the aforementioned bombers, showcasing a proven pedigree for long-range, heavy-class aircraft. As of this writing (2014), it is intended that the new bomber - designated under the project name of \"PAK DA\" (\"Perspective Aviation Complex - Long-Range Aviation\") - will be a true flying wing, lacking any vertical tail surfaces, and operate as a subsonic aircraft utilizing modern stealth methods to reduce radar signatures (perhaps with some resemblance to the American Northrop Grumman B-2 \"Spirit\" stealth bomber). Program support is provided through state-owned UAC.\n\r\nIn March of 2013, the Russian Air Force approved of a Tupolev design submission and quantitative serial production was tentatively scheduled for 2020. It is presumed that data/technology garnered in the (ongoing) development of the Sukhoi T-50 \"PAK-FA\" 5th Generation Fighter will also be instituted in the PAK DA design.\n\r\nIn September of 2014, it was reported that construction of the PAK DA prototype had been approved during 2013 for a start in 2014. First flight is now scheduled for sometime in 2019 with state acceptance trials for 2023 with service entry with the Russian Air Force following. The aircraft will be constructed at the UAC Kazan facility. The engine of choice is believed to be a Kuznetsov design based on the NK-32 turbofan of which the PAK DA will make use of up to four such installations. This engine already powers the Tu-160.\n\r\nOrigins of the PAK DA lay in a 2008 Russian Air Force requirement which evolved into the now-known subsonic flying wing product. The four-engined configuration will help the aircraft achieve the desired ranges and performance specifications. Avionics may include some of what has been developed for the T-50 fighter. Munitions support is expected to include cruise missiles, nuclear ordnance and precision-guided bombs as well as conventional dump bomb support.\n\r\nAt this stage of development, there remains little official information on the PAK DA though the program has the approval of both Russian leaders Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev. Details of this aircraft will change as the program gains steam.

The teams will operate under the \"China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation\" product banner - abbreviated as \"CRAIC\" - with headquarters based in Shanghai, China (though engineering will take place in Moscow, Russia).\n\r\nThe product is tentatively designated \"C929\".\n\r\nThere will be three variants of the base design drawn up: the short-ranged form will seat 230 persons and the intermediate-range variant will shuttle approximately 280 persons (with Economy-class seating set as nine across). The long-range model will house up to 320 passengers. It is expected that the general range of the intermediate aircraft design will reach up to 7,500 miles with power (rather interestingly) to come from a foreign engine brand (British Rolls-Royce or American General Electric being named so far). The primary goal of the project is to advance operating cost efficiency for carriers so, to aid this, a wing mainplane primarily constructed out of advanced composites is said to be in play and up to half of the fuselage will feature the technology with extensive lines integrated to provide the necessary electric service to the various planned components.\n\r\nThe initial design phase is set to run from 2017 until the conclusion of 2018 at which point certification will be sought the following year. A first-flight is tentatively scheduled for 2024 and first-delivery will occur before the end of the next decade. The joint partnership hopes to see the launch of the new line sometime in the late-2020s.\n\r\nBased on UAC company renderings, the C929 is expected to maintain a traditional design arrangement with a forward-set flight deck, tubular fuselage and single-finned tail unit. The engine pairing will be underslung at each wing (one engine per wing) and the wing mainplanes swept rearwards while capped by finely contoured winglets adding efficiency.

Developed from the earlier Ka-25 (\"Hormone\", the finalized development of the prototype Ka-20), the Ka-27, in its original form, was flown for the first time in December of 1973 and saw series introduction occur in 1982. Like other Kamov helicopter designs, the Ka-65 continues the series tradition of utilizing co-axial main rotors in place of using a traditional tail rotor unit (to counter the inherent effects of torque).\n\r\nThe initial design arrangement of the new helicopter appeared in 2019. The Ka-65 will follow the form-and-function of the Ka-27 family in that it will be operated from all in-service and upcoming Russian Navy ships in number and be typically outfitted for the Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) role (carrying sonar, torpedoes, depth charges and the like). The versatility of the helicopter will be such that it will be able to undertake other over-water roles including Search and Rescue (SAR), Electronic Warfare (EW), Over-the-Horizon spotting, and maritime enforcement.\n\r\nThe general configuration of the helicopter will be largely conventional: the flight deck will be aft of a short, heavily-windowed nose section with side-by-side seating for the operating crew of two. The passenger section will incorporate five viewing windows to each fuselage side and have hinged entry / exit doors for both flight crew and passengers. Over the lower sides of the fuselage will be featured sponsons housing the main landing gear legs (wheeled, retractable) while a twin-wheeled nose leg will be positioned at its usual place under the nose.\n\r\nThe tail unit will be of short length (as in the earlier Kamov iterations) and sport a single, high-reaching vertical fin along with a forward-set horizontal plane, this member itself bookended by smaller vertical planes for the needed stability and support in flight. The lack of a true tail rotor unit means that the helicopter is afforded a smaller profile aboard generally space-strapped warships and carriers at the expense of complexity in adding a second main rotor unit.\n\r\nPower is set to come from a pair of in-development Klimov TV7-117VK turboshaft engines rated up to 3,750 horsepower each and these will be carried over the fuselage and used to power both three-bladed main rotors.\n\r\nDevelopment of the Ka-65 coincides with the construction of a pair of new helicopter carriers being completed for the Russian Navy under the \"Project 23900\" designation (detailed elsewhere on this site). The pair of hulls will feature no fewer than eight landing spots aboard their flight deck and be outfitted to tackle the amphibious assault role while supporting attack, transport, and support helicopters.

The design is sponsored by Rostek State Corporation (UAC) and was teased in the days leading up to the MAKS 2021 air show outside Moscow. The aircraft appears to borrow design lines from both the American Lockheed Martin F-35 \"Lightning II\" strike fighter and the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 \"Felon\" multi-role fighter, both featuring inherent stealth characteristics as well as 5th Generation classification.\n\r\nAt its core, the fighter in question is of single-seat, single-engine configuration with proven external stealth characteristics including fuselage chine running from nose to tail. The cockpit is seated aft of a short nosecone, presumably shrouding an all-modern radar unit.  The fuselage is deep, tapered at the nose and tail ends, and assumed to house an internal weapons bay or bays. Interestingly, the air inlet is fitted ventrally, allowing for clean air intake to the turbofan within the middle-aft of the fuselage (the Lockheed F-16 \"Fighting Falcon\" and Eurofighter \"Typhoon\" multirole types both feature this design quality). The new fighter also bears some similarities to the Boeing X-32, a prototype strike fighter which unsuccessfully competed with the X-35 for the role eventually fulfilled by the F-35 Lighting II design. The exhaust port of the engine, bookended at the rear of the fuselage by the tailfins, is circular.\n\r\nThe mainplanes are of relatively small-area delta shape, negating the need for traditional horizontal tailplanes. The tailplanes featured are outward-canted, believed to be all-moving, and cover the role of vertical and horizontal planes seen in more conventional fighter designs.\n\r\nEstimate performance figures indicate a maximum speed beyond Mach 2.0. Gross Take-Off Weight (GTOW) is assumed to be in the 20 ton (short) region. Comparatively, the F-35 reaches speeds of Mach 1.6 at altitude and sports a gross weight of 25 tons. The F-16 Block 50/52 aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 2.05 and a GTOW of 13.25 tons. As such, the Checkmate may feature performance and battlefield capabilities somewhere between this 5th and 4th (respectively) fighter designs.\n\r\nIt is accepted that the Checkmate aircraft on display at MAKS is a full-sized mockup and not a full-fledged, flyable prototype. Additionally, base on the tail number on display, the fighter may carry the official designation of \"Su-75\" in service.\n\r\nNamed prime candidates for the Checkmate appear to include Argentina and Vietnam who both field an aging feet of primary 4th Generation (or older) fighters. India always remains in the running for new Russia fighter types as well while the Checkmate may very well be used as a lightweight counterpart to the heavier Su-57 for the Russian Air Force, as the Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" has been to the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" series for decades.\n\r\nNOTE: Structural dimensions and performance specifications showcased on this page are estimates on the part of the author.

Images of the completed form surfaced in mid/late January showcasing a large drone with tricycle landing gear and of full flying wing arrangement being towed by an agricultural vehicle. Development on the type is believed to have been ongoing since about 2012 and a rollout was had in mid-2018 with ground-testing commencing thereafter. Still early in its development, the Okhotnik-B presents a significant step forward for the Russian desire to catch up with the West regarding UAV/UCAV capability.\n\r\nThe Su-70 is in the same class as the American Northrop Grumman X-47B carrier-based flying wing UAV - and it shares a very similar outward appearance to it. In Russian service, these air vehicles may work as unmanned companion assets to the new-generation Su-57 fighters also being developed by the Sukhoi concern.\n\r\nAs a true flying wing design, the Su-70 does away with any vertical planes, keeping all control surfaces mated to the blended wing-body form. This includes ailerons, flaps and the usual surfaces needed for actions such as roll, pitch and the like. The blended wing-body form is a well-accepted approach indicating a low-profile design with inherent stealth characteristics. The tricycle landing gear arrangement is of typical configuration for ground-running: two main legs coupled with a nose leg. All are retractable into the underside of the aircraft to maintain aerodynamic efficiency at high speeds. Furthermore, the nose leg has a dual-wheel arrangement while the main legs sport large wheels indicating the required support for this large, heavy-class vehicle. The assumed powerplant is a Sukhoi turbofan and this is buried in the aft-section of the body, exhausting through a circular port at the rear of the vehicle. A single engine configuration is used. The engine is aspirated through a trapezoidal intake above and aft of the flying wing's apex (as in the X-47B).\n\r\nAn internal weapons bay is also assumed as is support for the various, in-service Russian Air Force air-to-surface missiles and precision-guided bombs.

The current schedule sees a prototype recording a first-flight in 2019 and deliveries/service introduction to follow either in 2020 or in 2021.\n\r\nThe VRT500 utilizes a conventional layout with the twin-seat cockpit at front and a modest passenger cabin directly aft. Vision out-of-the-cockpit is excellent thanks to the heavy use of large window panes across the front and sides of the airframe. Overhead of the cabin is the single engine installation. A single-boom tail arrangement is in play at the rear of the design and its raised position allows a rear easy-access cargo door to be fitted. The occupants enter/exit the vehicle through hinged automobile-style doors for the pilots and sliding doors for the passengers (up to five passengers can be carried). A simple four-point skid arrangement is used for ground-running.\n\r\nThe one unique quality of the VRT500 is its Kamov-style co-axial main rotor fit which seats one main rotor over the other and both spin in opposite directions. This has the same effect as a tail rotor unit to eliminate the natural effects of torque upon the airframe. The twin main rotor reduces complexity to the tail section as no long drive shaft is needed to power a tail rotor system. Each main rotor assembly is equipped with three blades of carbon fiber construction.\n\r\nAs it stands, the VRT500 is set to have a payload capacity of 1,610lb and a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) nearing 3,527lb. Maximum speeds will reach 250 kmh with cruising closer to 230 kmh. Its service ceiling is estimated at 20,000 feet and range is out to 460 nautical miles.\n\r\nThe company is envisioning sales reaching 1,000 units before the end of 2035 - no doubt threatening the Bell and Robinson hold of the sub-2-ton helicopter market by a noticeable degree should the VRT500 prove a commercial success.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "VR-Technologies VRT500", "aircraft_type": "Light Utility Helicopter (LUH)"}, {"id": "62023fb6-4f9f-4fd3-863e-d9009df5711b", "year_model": "2023", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Chinese and Russians have entered into a joint design partnership to produce an all-new very-high-altitude, heavy-lift helicopter.

More importantly, engineers have been given the challenge of designing the aircraft with a service ceiling up to 18,696 feet (5,700 meters) capable of reaching the highest points of the rugged Chinese countryside. Gross weight is estimated at 84,200 pounds with possible seating for some sixty passengers. At present, this rotorcraft would be dimensionally smaller than the mammoth Russian Mil Mi-26 \"Halo\" heavy hauler but larger (and twice as heavy) as the American Boeing CH-47F \"Chinook\" tandem rotor system of the U.S. military. The Mi-26 is currently the largest helicopter in service anywhere in the world with operators in Russia, India and the Ukraine (among others).\n\r\nAviCopter of China is heading the Chinese side of the development with the project name being \"Advanced Heavy Lifter\" (HAL) and its in-service designation becoming \"AC332\" (formally the \"AC3X2\"). An early design effort was showcased in September 2015 during the China Helicopter Exposition in Tianjin. The AHL effort is being largely funded by China.\n\r\nA typical medium-lift helicopter can hover between 10,500 and 14,000 feet maximum before the engine's ability to breath the thinner air restricts further climbing (forward flight reveals a maximum altitude nearer 25,000 feet). In June of 1972, a specially-modified high-altitude Aerospatiale \"Lama\" helicopter lightweight helicopter achieved 40,814 feet to set a new absolute altitude record. However, the engine flamed out and forced an autorotation landing by the pilot (Jean Boulet of France). With that landing the helicopter also set the world record for longest autorotation period.\n\r\nChina has a history of operating and building both Soviet/Russian and, more recently, French helicopters. With this knowledge, and that offered by Russian engineers, the AC332 is set to take on a most sleek, modern appearance. The main rotor blades, set low over the engine pairing, showcases seven composite blades with swept tips for reduced vibration and drag. The AHL may be outfitted with Russian-originated powerplants of AVIC of China cannot come through with an indigenous offering(the AVIC WZ-20 of 8,000 horsepower output - two would be fitted). The tail-rotor, set along the starboard side of the tail fin, holds a five-bladed rotor system.

Its form largely mimics the in-service heavy-lifter.\n\r\nBoth versions sport a three-point wheeled undercarriage with retractable functionality. Lift capabilities are to be consistent with heavy-lift types for service in civilian sectors (SAR, firefighting, etc...), the construction industry and (possibly) military with an under-slung capability in moving palletized supplies, artillery systems or whole armored vehicles to generally unreachable areas of the world.

Beyond this, special-mission equipment can make it an effective airborne Electronic Warfare (EW) platform.\n\r\nThe Korsar was first showcased in prototype form in 2015 at the Army International Military-Technical Forum followed by a demonstration during the 2018 Moscow Victory Parade. An export-minded version, with slightly reduced performance capabilities, was revealed at MAKS 2019. A Russian naval variant is known as the \"Korsar-M\".\n\r\nThe vehicle is given a weight of 440 lb (200 kg) with a maximum take-off weight nearing 882 lb (400 kg) and has a wingspan of 21.3 feet (6.5 m) and an overall length of 13.8 feet (4.2 m).\n\r\nThe overall design is sleek with smoothly-contouring lines. Hull chine is noticeable where the upper and lower fuselage sections are joined. The mainplanes are near-shoulder-mounted and are straight in their general shape for good low-and-slow loitering sorties. Tailplanes are held on rearward-extended booms and are joined at their tips, resulting in an inward-cranked appearance of the rudder pair (known as a \"V-tail arrangement\"). The tricycle undercarriage is wheeled and retractable in the design, preserving aerodynamic efficiency to an extent. The nose contains all pertinent mission and avionics systems while a blister pack is slung under the fuselage. There is a noticeable bulge of the fuselage at the mid-dorsal section.\n\r\nThe air vehicle is powered by a conventional engine (rated between 50- and 70-horsepower) driving a propeller unit in pusher arrangement, capable of reaching speeds of 95 miles-per-hour (approximately 150 kmh).\n\r\nThe system features an operating range of up to 560 miles (900 km) and its communications set can transmit data from up to 100 km away from the receiver source. Special relay equipment / ground vehicles can enhance this reach even further for ground commanders. The aircraft can stay aloft for up to eight hours and reach operating altitudes of up to 16,404 feet (5,000 m).\n\r\nIn late 2020, it was reported that the Korsar was undergoing active operational evaluation with Russian military forces. As many as three may have been built heading into 2022. The series may have been operationally used in the Syrian Civil War (2011-Present) alongside Russian elements.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Rostech (Luch) Korsar", "aircraft_type": "Armed / Unarmed Reconnaissance UAV"}, {"id": "b7702b46-df06-4d4b-8bcd-1c72a6a3b425", "year_model": "2020", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile Russia has been relatively slow at adopting larger-scale drones for military and civilian use, the gap has shortened considerably with each passing decade. Enter the \"VRT300\" by VR-Technologies (under the Russian Helicopters parent label), designed as a twin-main-rotor Unmanned Aircraft System destined for the commercial market. The air vehicle is expected to begin its flight-testing phase before the end of 2018 and fulfill a broad range of commercial services - for Russia this means primarily the offshore drilling, environmental surveying, and icebreaking/data-collection roles but other potential sorties are set to include overwater Search-and-Rescue (SAR) and at-sea/offshore resupply.\n\r\nThe VRT300 features a co-axial main rotor system in which two main rotors are sat atop one another. Both rotors have three blades and these spin in opposite directions to effectively cancel out inherent torque effects while, at the same time, negating the need for a complex shaft-driven tail rotor unit (coaxial/stacked main rotors are a very common quality of Russian Kamov helicopters listed elsewhere on this site). The main rotors sit over the fuselage-body in the usual way and a heavy-fueled engine is used to drive them both. The body is deep and wide enough to house all pertinent operating components - fuel, avionics, mission systems - while a sensor blister is fitted in the \"chin\" position offering 360-dregee traversal, real-time High-Definition video feeding, and stabilization. A mission module can be slung under the fuselage between the two tube landing skids with payloads limited to 150lb of equipment. The tailplanes are arranged in split-vertical fin fashion and sit at the end of a short tail stem.\n\r\nTwo major variants are being drawn up by VR-Technologies for the VRT300 series: \"Arctic Supervision\" and \"OpticVision\". The former is outfitted with a side-scan, high-resolution X-band radar unit and the latter features increased operational ranges for operations in harder-to-reach areas. As it stands in mid-2018, the VRT300 design is nearly all fleshed out with serial production efforts being arranged.\n\r\nThe company is also developing the \"VRT500\" as a larger,manned offshoot of the VRT300 and categorized as a Light Utility Helicopter (LUH).

Work on this compact platform began in 2007 and the product was unveiled at MAKS 2009. The SR-10 was originally developed in response to a Russian Air Force requirement of 2014 which sought to secure a new basic trainer aircraft. However, this requirement was eventually fulfilled by the Yakovlev Yak-152 (detailed elsewhere on this site). A first-flight for the still-in-development SR-10 occurred on December 25th, 2015 and work on the aircraft is ongoing as of 2017 to which a single, flyable example was been completed to date (2017).\n\r\nThe aircraft seats its crew of two in tandem (one behind the other) with good views offered for both pilots (instructor and student) out over the nose. The single engine installation, buried within the aerodynamically-refined fuselage, is aspirated by small, side-mounted rectangular intakes and exhausted through a single port at the rear of the design. The wing roots extend over the intakes and meet each of the mainplane leading edges. The most unique feature about this Russian aircraft is its forward-swept wing mainplane - each element having a sweep of ten degrees giving the SR-10 a very science- fiction-like appearance. The mainplanes are set just aft of midships and are high-mounted along the fuselage sides. A single vertical tail fin is featured at the rear of the aircraft along with low-mounted horizontal tailplanes, these sporting noticeable anhedral. Ground-running is accomplished by way of a conventional three-legged retractable undercarriage. Overall construction of the aircraft relies heavily on use of lightweight, yet strong, composites.\n\r\nThe SR-10 carries a single Ivchencko AI-25V turbofan engine rated at 3,790lb of thrust. This provides the platform with a maximum speed of 560 miles per hour and cruises at 325 mph. Range is out to 930 miles and a service ceiling of 932 miles is reported. Rate-of-climb is 12,000 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nStructurally, the SR-10 has an overall length of 31 feet, 5 inches, a wingspan of 27 feet, 6 inches and a height of 11 feet, 7 inches.

Today, Mil is set to introduce their latest development - the Mi-38 - intended to compete in the crowded and highly lucrative medium transport helicopter market in both civilian- and military-minded guises, its design comparable to the European AgustaWestland AW101/EH101 Merlin in scope and function. The initial Mi-38 prototype achieved first flight on December 22nd, 2003 and three prototype vehicles have been completed since with serial production set to begin in 2013. Manufacture of the aircraft is being handled by Kazan Helicopter Plant (Kazan Helicopters) out of the Republic of Tatarstan. The concern holds experience in producing other famous Mil helicopters including the Mi-8 and Mi-17 series transports.\n\r\nIn its finalized form, the Mi-38 will sport an all-glass digital cockpit (the prototype promoted a rather uninspiring and highly traditional setup with needled gauges) with a high degree of automation to allow for single-pilot function (though a two-pilot crew will still be a standard arrangement). System and mission displays will be presented in full color with push-button style accessibility. Externally, the Mi-38 will sport a more \"Western\" style compared to previous Mil offerings, being well-contoured through and through with an aerodynamically-friendly shape. The cockpit is situated at the extreme front-end of the fuselage in the usual way (dominated by a framed window arrangement) with the passenger/cargo compartment directly aft of the cockpit and underneath the twin engine installations. Based on available imagery, the undercarriage appears to be fixed in place and not retractable. This arrangement will consist of a pair of single-wheeled main legs and a twin-wheeled nose leg. General access will be through conventional rectangular fold-down/pull-down doors, doubling as staircase ramps, while dedicated transport versions will sport a larger rectangular door along the starboard side and a large powered cargo ramp under the tail unit giving unfettered access to the fuselage.\n\r\nMil plans to offer the Mi-38 in three distinct production versions - VIP, MEDEVAC and general utility transport. The VIP passenger variant will feature luxurious seating for up to 12 persons and sport a 700 kilometer ferry range. In the MEDEVAC role, the internal cabin will be arranged to space out up to 16 medical litters and light staff. The general utilize transport variant will be the multirole performer expected to undertake the role of passenger ferry or cargo hauler and most likely also marketed to interested military parties. In the former role, the internal cabin will be arranged to seat some 30 passengers with a ferry range of approximately 450 kilometers. In the latter role, the internal configuration will be such that cargo matching up to 5 tons will be permitted and an additional 7 tons will be carried under the fuselage via sling method. Beyond the presented roles, the adaptability of the Mi-38 airframe will be key to its long-term success. It will be configurable to roles such as Search & Rescue (SAR), over-water passenger transport (to service offshore drilling platforms and the like) and be capable of operating in day/night, all-weather environments due to the onboard advanced systems.\n\r\nThe Mi-38 airframe will host two distinct engine configurations to broaden its world-wide appeal - one version fitting 2 x Klimov TV7-117V turboshaft engines and the other fitted 2 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127/TS turboshaft engines - either selection rated with an output of 2,800 shaft horsepower each. In this way, Mil can market their new helicopter to historically Soviet-Russian aligned customers or Western customers with experience in the American Pratt & Whitney powerplant. The engines will power a large, six-bladed main rotor blade (of composite construction) and a pair of two-bladed tail rotors mounted atop one another (appearing as a four-bladed type assembly). Kazan lists a maximum speed for its Mi-38 of 285kph with a cruise speed of 275kmh. Ferry range will be 1,300km with extra fuel tanks utilized. The maximum service ceiling is reported as 5,100 meters with a hover ceiling of 2,800 meters.\n\r\nWhile having undergone a rather lengthy developmental phase, it appears that the Mi-38 project is now (2013) picking up steam and will be made available to interested customers within the year. As of this writing, the Mi-38 has not received an official NATO designation codename (2016).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-38", "aircraft_type": "Medium-Lift Twin-Engine Transport Helicopter"}, {"id": "7b1a6e4f-d007-4144-9de3-552273387c7e", "year_model": "2019", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Su-57 (formerly \"PAK FA\" and \"T-50\") is currently in development with the storied Sukhoi OKB, a Russian aircraft firm granted origins in the dark days of World War 2 (1939-1945) and having since contributed many designs to the Soviet Air Force and Army in the Cold War years following. The Su-57 is categorized as a \"Fifth Generation Fighter\" recognizing that it will make use of the latest aviation technology, radar-absorbing materials and weaponry to provide for excellent performance, agility and response for the unseen conflicts ahead. As a Fifth Generation fighter, the Su-57 is challenging the realm currently dominated by the American Lockheed F-22 \"Raptor\" air superiority fighter  - the world's first 5th gen fighter aircraft. The arrival of the T-50 introduces a second player to the once exclusive \"Fifth Generation Club\", owned wholly by the United States, while China continues development of their own indigenous 5th gen fighter across the Pacific.\n\r\nIn the Russian, \"PAK FA\" translates to \"Future Air Complex - Tactical Air Forces\". The Su-57 has been developed somewhat jointly through a partnership between Russia and India to which India has contributed as much as 35% to date. The Indian intent is to benefit from the program by procuring their own PAK FA-based 5th gen fighter in the coming decade. Serial production for the T-50 is slated for 2015 and the first public unveiling of the prototype was shown during the MAKS 2011 Air Show just outside of Moscow in August of 2011. Four prototypes has been completed to date (2013) with a fifth under construction. State trials are expected for 2014.\n\nThe Near Future\n\r\nIn the Russian inventory, the Su-57 will move in to take over the roles held by the large Sukhoi Su-27/Su-37 \"Flanker\" family as well as the lightweight Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" (all 4th Generation Fighters). Both of these lines have gone on to see much use in the global market resulting in a myriad of variants and configurations. The Su-57 will also move along the joint Russian-Indian FGFA (Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft) program for the near future - an agreement reached between the two nations in 2001 - with results expected to be introduced sometime in 2015. This aircraft and will be based highly on the developmental findings of the Russian PAK FA/T-50/Su-57 program with India intending to purchasing some 250 FGFA fighters at project's end. \n\nThe T-50 Prototype\n\r\nThe PAK FA prototypes are designated as \"T-50\". As a multi-role aircraft, the Su-57 will be charged with both air superiority and ground attack roles as well as aerial reconnaissance by way of specialized onboard equipment. Her design will provide excellent performance within her altitude limitations and make possible operations in both day/night as well as adverse weather conditions. Sukhoi intends on making her an equally-lethal performer in all of her defined roles. Dimensionally, the Su-57 will reflect the size of the other proven Sukhoi flagship product, the Su-27 Flanker.\n\nProject Background\n\r\nBy the end of the Cold War, the need to replace Russia's high-performance \"do-everything\" fighters became more apparent to authorities. Several projects were enacted to find solutions for a next generation craft and two such programs produced the Mikoyan MiG \"1.44\" and the Sukhoi Su-47 \"Berkut\" (the latter formerly known as the S-32 as well as S-37). The MiG 1.44 became a highly-secretive technology demonstrator and achieved first flight on February 29th, 2000. She was intended to compete directly with the American Lockheed F-22 Raptor in the air superiority role. The MiG 1.44 sported forward canards with an underfuselage split air intake similar to the Eurofighter 2000. The Sukhoi Su-47 Berkut was the other technology demonstrator though it had the greater possibility of seeing full-scale production. Most notable of the type was its forward-swept wing arrangement (ala the Grumman X-29 concept) and decidedly large Sukhoi-brand dimensions. The Su-47 achieved first flight on September 25th, 1997 and was formally unveiled in January of 2000. Only a single known example of the Su-47 was ever built while two examples of the MiG 1.44 (the other being the similar MiG 1.42/42) was known to exist. Both were powered by a dual engine layout and much information garnered from the proceeding in-flight tests have played a role in the development of the Su-57.\n\r\nIn the early part of 2002, Sukhoi was selected to head up the design of Russia's new Fifth Generation Fighter. By the start of 2003, other minority contract winners were announced to design, develop and construct applicable components such as the avionics suite and engine powerplants as well as the understructure and final assembly systems. Production of the very first aircraft was started by August 2007 with the goal of having three such flyable systems on hand by the beginning of 2009. Some inevitable delays followed throughout 2009, resulting in a first flight date achieved on January 29th, 2010 - this lasting some forty-seven minutes and achieving all required goals. The first flight itself was delayed from January 28th due to bad weather in the region. A second flight followed soon afterwards, on February 6th, and a third flight was recorded on February 12th. These serve to indicate the relative readiness of the PAK FA project up to this point.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-57 (Felon)", "aircraft_type": "5th Generation Multi-Role Stealth Aircraft"}, {"id": "d2418499-5f52-4c02-a91b-c8f44a89049e", "year_model": "2019", "description": "\r\n        \tThe ZALA \"Lancet\" is a \"loitering munition\" Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) originating from Russia's ZALA Aero.

The CS300 is designed to compete directly with larger market types such as the French Airbus A320neo and American Boeing 737MAX offerings.\n\r\nAs of July 1st, 2018, the Bombardier C-Series is under majority-ownership of Airbus.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Airbus A220 (Bombardier C-Series)", "aircraft_type": "Medium-Range / Transcontinental Narrow-Body Passenger Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "97e89716-8e60-4527-9e28-4fcd6c025a64", "year_model": "2017", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Rostech Chirok (\"Teal\") Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was unveiled in prototype form during Innoprom 2014 and differentiates itself from existing UAV lines by its air, land, and over-water capabilities. Appearing as something of a winged-hovercraft, this UAV can traverse over land and water surfaces while also climbing to altitude to significantly broaden the Chirok's tactical appeal to a world of potential customers. As such, the design will be marketed to a broad range of services including those non-military such as oil rig support, natural disaster support, border patrol, and humanitarian relief. In its more military-minded role, the aircraft would be used for general ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) and may very well be armed at a future date for the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) role. While development is on-going with full-scale flight testing set to begin in 2015, serial production is not slated for 2016 or later.\n\r\nThe \"Chirok\" name stems from a species of duck common to Russia and details the inherent capabilities of this UAV.\n\r\nAs designed, the Chirok can take-off and land from virtually any surface whether hard or soft which instantly benefits operations without access to a prepared, or even rough-field, runways. A cushion of air supports the vehicle during its ground running, mimicking the qualities seen in many-a-hovercraft for decades. The entire vehicle - its construction utilizing composite - sits atop this cushion system. The cushion makes the Chirok wholly unique in the world of UAVs. When the aircraft becomes airborne, the cushion component retracts into the fuselage to maintain a more aerodynamically refined airframe. The fuselage features an enlarged forward section, though well-streamlined with fine contours, leading to the monoplane wing assemblies and a twin-boom tail unit fitted aft. A pair of inward-cranked vertical tail fins are seated at the end of the booms, joined at their tips to become a single assembly. Power is served through a pair of small engines seated atop short stubs though exact propulsion system arrangement has yet to be released. Each engine drives a four-bladed propeller assembly in a \"pusher\" configuration. Its general shape, size, and skin is said to carry inherent stealth qualities.\n\r\nTo date (2014), the only specifications released on the Chirok include a wingspan of 32.8 feet, a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 1,545lbs, and a payload capacity of 660lbs. A service ceiling of 19,685 feet is also reported as is an operational range of 1,555 miles - giving the small, compact vehicle a good reach in any desired role.\n\r\nWhile initially unarmed, it is said that an internal weapons bay could be fitted to the design, allowing the Chirok to field compact precision weapons for the UCAV role. How this would work with the retractable air cushion is unclear though it would help support its stealth design approach.\n\r\nIt is expected that the ongoing nature of the Chirok program will undoubtedly lead to various design changes featured, including its propulsion arrangement and performance.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Rostech Chirok (Teal)", "aircraft_type": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Hovercraft"}, {"id": "b2acc38e-a33e-4b6f-a6f7-17508a5feac8", "year_model": "2016", "description": "\r\n        \tAs with China and Turkey, India is striving to join the ranks of prominent world powers by becoming a recognized exporter of indigenously designed military goods for budget-conscious shoppers throughout Asia and elsewhere. India certainly can provide the manpower and will to make itself a 1st tier power though it suffers from technological and engineering experience limitations in certain areas - forced to rely on outside help to see more complex projects through. Currently, the Indian industrial-complex is developing an array of small arms, armored vehicles, warships, submarines, and aircraft all its own - including the highly-touted, still- in-development HAL \"Tejas\" multirole fighter. To help bring along a new medium-lift tactical transport, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) of India has partnered with the Russian concern of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) which has, under its umbrella, defense industry names like Ilyushin and Irkut at its service.\n\r\nThe aircraft in question is currently designated as \"IL-214\" and known by the rather appropriate project name of \"Multirole Transport Aircraft\" (MTA). Multirole Transport Aircraft Ltd was arranged as the joint venture company to handle the new system. A scale model of the MTA was displayed at Aero India 2009.\n\r\nExternally, the IL-214 showcases common design themes seen in other medium-lift, jet-powered airlifters - its wing mainplanes are swept back and set high on the fuselage (while featuring underslung engine nacelles), the flight deck is aft of a short nosecone for excellent viewing out-of-the-cockpit, and a raised empennage section allows for the needed access to the rear cargo hold ramp. The tail unit displays a \"T-style\" arrangement to keep the horizontal planes clear of the jet exhaust and the undercarriage will rely on a multi-bogie wheeled approach under center mass with a double-wheeled leg held under the nose. An in-flight refueling probe is visible over the cockpit roof for nearly unlimited operational ranges.\n\r\nInternally, the IL-214 is expected to have a cargo capacity equal to that of the Soviet-era Ilyushin IL-76MD transport model. Volume will be enough to carry up to 140 combat personnel and will serve up to 90 fully-equipped paratroopers. The aircraft will also be able to conduct MEDAVAC sorties and haul patient litters and staff as well as applicable mission equipment. Cargo pallets will also be supported as will whole military vehicles such as HUMVEE-sized 4x4 wheeled types. Beyond this the aircraft will be given a capability to air-drop goods as required. Beyond its obvious military applications the IL-214 will also be marketed as a civilian freighter.\n\r\nLow and high altitude performance will be key considerations in the IL-214 design and its engines are slated to be 2 x Aviadvigatel PD-14M turbofans outputting 34,392 lb of thrust each. The aircraft is intended for all-weather operation and, coupled to a rugged fuselage, will be made capable of performing take-offs and landings from both prepared and unprepared runways providing something of a tactical advantage in any warzone.\n\r\nAt this point, HAL of India is slated to manufacture the frontal section of the fuselage and the wing mainplanes and it will also lend a hand in development of the avionics fit. Russian company Irkut will provide the remaining sections of the fuselage. Development is a joint venture between HAL and UAC. The Russian Air Force is planning on procuring some 100 of the type while the Indian Air Force (IAF) is scheduled to take delivery of 105 units and offer at least sixty of these for export. The IAF will use the IL-214 to replace its aging stock of Antonov  An-32 haulers.\n\r\nCurrent specifications include a length of 37.7 meters with a wingspan of 35.5 meters and a height of 12.95 meters. Payload capacity is in the 44,000 lb range with a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) listed at 150,000 lb. Performance estimates include a maximum speed of 540 miles per hour, a cruise speed of 505 miles per hour, a range of 4,535 miles, and a service ceiling reaching 43,000 feet.\n\r\nOriginally, the program expected to see a first flight during 2014 but this did not prove realistic for the slowly-evolving product.

Long-time Russian helicopter maker Kamov has unveiled plans to produce a helicopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for possible shipboard and land-based use by the Russian military and intelligence services. The system would feature the trademark Kamov contra-rotating main rotor blades in which one main unit is seated over the other, negating the need for a tail rotor to counter torque. The arrangement has been proven for decades by the company throughout their extensive line of military and civilian helicopter models. The UAV is expected for the ISR role (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) and will carry applicable mission equipment as its payload. Kamov engineers have finalized vehicle's drawings with a mock-up already completed. A full-scale vehicle could be ready to make a first flight for 2015 with service entry possible shortly beyond that.\n\r\nOther design features include a well-sloped fuselage section supported by a simple four-point landing skid arrangement - doing away with a more complicated, retractable setup. The fuselage will house all associated flight systems including avionics, payload, and fuel stores as well as the undisclosed powerplant. The empennage will be an integrated structure mounting the horizontal stabilizer with down-turned vertical tail fins.\n\r\nThe new Kamov endeavor will carry the designation of \"Ka-175\".

Kazan Helicopters of Russia - once a contributor to the many Mil helicopter products -  now manages its own direction in helicopter development and manufacture. Following a failed joint venture attempt with Eurocopter, Kazan eventually struck out on its definitive own during the early-to-mid 1990s and formed its own in-house team of engineers with new product goals in mind. One of the resulting designs became a lightweight helicopter platform which achieved first flight on August 17th, 1999. Today, the product is known under the name of \"Ansat\", features several possible variations on the base design and is poised to generate some interest on the world market - particularly with many medium-lift utility types meeting the end of their useful service lives the world over.\n\r\nThe standard Ansat design features a crew of two seated side-by-side in a typical arrangement. The middle section of the fuselage is accordingly reserved for passengers to which the helicopter can seat up to ten in comfort. Additionally, the cabin can be configuration for various roles - both civilian and military in nature - which adds a quality of modularity to the product. The engine compartment is conventionally set atop the cabin roof and consists of 2 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PW2-7K turboshafts developing up to 630 horsepower each. The engines drive a four-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed tail rotor with the main rotor sitting atop a short mast while the tail rotor is offset to the starboard side of the aircraft. Large sliding side doors allow for relatively easy entry/exit of the passenger cabin and hinged automobile-style doors are used by the pilots at front. Vision out of the cockpit is expectedly strong thanks to large use of transparent windscreens where possible. The undercarriage is of a skid arrangement which allows the helicopter to land on unprepared surfaces with relative ease.\n\r\nAt least several major prototypes emerged from testing with the first leading the way in ground testing for a static airframe. The next prototype became was a flyable version which marked the line's first official airborne attempt in 1999. A follow-up prototype was identified a lengthened fuselage which increased internal volume and yet another prototype was granted new \"clam shell\" style doors at the passenger cabin, the lower section used as a handy stair case. The standard Ansat helicopter is listed with a maximum speed of 170 miles per hour with a cruising speed of approximately 155 miles per hour. Range is expected to reach around 335 miles with a service ceiling of 14,760 feet and rate-of-climb nearing 4,250 feet per minute.\n\r\nSuch a broad developmental approach has yielded several notable configurations being offered by Kazan: The \"Ansat-U\" is a military-minded helicopter trainer that features a dual-control scheme for student and instructor (this version has been accepted by the Russian Air Force as its next helicopter trainer platform). The \"Ansat-UT\" is another variant though featuring a wheeled undercarriage as opposed to the original's skid assembly. The \"Ansat-M\" is a MEDEVAC platform designed specifically for hauling two patient litters, medical staff and applicable mission equipment.  In an effort to interest the military market, the \"Ansat-UM\" has followed suit as a militarized MEDEVAC offering and can carry up to four patient litters. \n\r\nWhile these are all useful helicopter products, the most interesting offshoot of the Ansat line is the proposed \"Ansat-2RC\" - a vastly modified two-seat light attack helicopter model based on the Ansat internal workings. The crew are seated in stepped cockpits  and this has resulted in a slimmer fuselage  and thinner forward profile. The skid undercarriage is retained for simplicity and robustness as is the four-bladed main rotor, starboard side-mounted tail rotor and twin engine pairing. Standard armament includes a fixed-position 12.7mm heavy machine gun along the starboard side of the fuselage. Optional armament would be affixed along two short wing stubs each managing a pair of hardpoints. It is expected that the helicopter would support various Russian- and Western-originated ordnance products ranging from homing/guided missiles, rocket pods, cannon pods and even conventional drop bombs. An Ansat-2RC was displayed at MAKS 2007 to help prove the concept sound and generate early interest in the product.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kazan Ansat", "aircraft_type": "Multirole Lightweight Utility Helicopter"}, {"id": "73fa1741-eb88-41ad-9cc7-52062c6d3cb3", "year_model": "2015", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mikoyan Skat is an in-development armed Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) with origins in a Russian Defense Ministry reconnaissance-minded Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The aircraft is intended as a direct competitor to the popular Boeing 777 and the newer, though troubled, Boeing 787 \"Dreamliner\". Production of early-form airframes began in 2010 with a first-flight expected sometime in 2013. Barring developmental delays, committed airlines will begin receiving the product beginning in 2014 to which production is estimated to reach 592 units based on received orders to date (2013). As of this writing, there are commitments from 35 total airline firms worldwide.\n\r\nThe A350 was born from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner program announcement. Airbus was initially slow to react until customers required a competing type promising the savings of the advanced 787. With that, a modified version of the A330 emerged until enough changes were instituted that the aircraft was given its own company designation of \"A350\". However, its most important customers were not impressed with the Airbus reaction to the Boeing offering and pushed Airbus to produce an all-new design incorporating the latest in available technologies. This resulted in a completed reworked and refined A350 concept which was eventually approved while delaying the A350 program considerably.\n\r\nCurrently, the A350 will be marketed in five distinct production forms.

The A350-800 will sport a running length of 198.6 feet while the A350-900, -900R and -900F will see a length reaching 219.5 feet. The A350-1000 will be the longest of the family line with a length of 242.4 feet.\n\r\nInternally, the A350 will sport a conventional airliner configuration. The flight deck is situated at the extreme front end of the vehicle and identified by the range of framed windows over the short, sloping nose assembly. Immediately aft of the flight deck is the passenger area which is spanned along either fuselage side by windows. Under the passenger area is the cargo hold. The freighter version of the A350 will naturally do away with the passenger seating elements to promote increased internal volume for additional hold space. Externally, the arrangement will be conventional, featuring two swept-back main wings at amidships and a traditional tail unit sporting a single vertical tail fin and dihedral horizontal planes. The undercarriage will be of the tricycle arrangement incorporating two main legs and a nose leg as standard.\n\r\nAll A350 forms will showcase a wingspan of 213 feet and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer construction throughout the wing assemblies and main fuselage. Power will be served through 2 x Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines which will be developed in two distinct forms either outputting between 74,000 to 83,000lbs of thrust or 97,000lbs of thrust.

Their victory over Syria in the 1982 Lebanon War was made possible, in part, by effective use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)  so it stands as no surprise that the country is at the forefront of modern drone design, development and production and other world forces have taken note. Russia, for instance, has adopted the IAI \"Searcher\" UAV and manufactures this Israeli product under license as the \"Forpost\", based on a subsequent production design designated as \"Searcher II\" which is an improved Second Generation model introduced by IAI in 1998.\n\r\nUAVs have proven themselves ideal over modern battlefields, particularly against less advanced foes. It is a booming industry and a hot commodity for any world-class military power and a plethora of manufacturers have popped up to sell their wares to whatever buyer is interested. Some are lightweight and hand-launched, others medium-class and catapult launched. Some have been designed as explosive, disposable suicide machines while, still others, are large, aircraft-like developments able to loiter over contested territory for hours on end.\n\r\nThe Forpost falls into the standard Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) category. Its form and function is largely similar to that as seen with the Searcher family line. A high-mounted monoplane wing arrangement is featured while an internal cargo bay holds mission support equipment. An optics fit is seen at the belly while a radar fit is identified along the dorsal spine of the aircraft. A 47 horsepower engine is seated at the rear of the fuselage in a \"pusher\" configuration, driving a three-bladed propeller. The Forpost retains the original's twin-boom, twin-tail-finned empennage and fixed, wheeled undercarriage.\n\r\nPerformance specifications are equal to that as seen in the Searcher II: a maximum speed of 125 miles per hour, a mission endurance window of about 18 hours, and a service ceiling up to 20,000 feet.\n\r\nThe Forpost has seen combat action in the skies over Ukraine and, presumably, Syria where Russian interest and direct involvement continues to grow.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Forpost ISR", "aircraft_type": "Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance Drone / UAV"}, {"id": "0b3a3846-b38c-4ddf-a52d-d9abd4af7960", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tSensing the growing market need for an all-modern, cost-effective medium-lift helicopter to serve in the offshore drilling service, the Italian concern of AgustaWestland is developing its impressive AW189 model. Based on the military AW149 product, the AW189 is intended for civil airspace as a passenger transport though it can be outfitted with optional equipment to suit various mission roles - indeed, AgustaWestland is marketing the AW189 series as a multirole type. With its crew of two, the aircraft can haul up to eighteen passengers some 230 miles at speeds exceeding 170 miles per hour. First flight of a prototype occurred on December 21st, 2011 and the product remains in development as of March 2014. The AW189 is already on order with seven countries including India, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\r\nThe AW189 is powered by 2 x General Electric CT7-2E1 turboshaft engines developing 2,000 horsepower each. The fuselage sports a length of 57.8 feet with a rotor diameter measuring 48 feet and a height of 16.6 feet. Gross weight is listed at 18,300lbs. Its specifications place it as a bridge product between the intermediate-lift AW139 and medium-heavy-lift AW101 models in the AgustaWestland helicopter lineup.\n\r\nThe general appearance of the vehicle is a sleek one, incorporating a shallow nose cone ahead of a glazed cockpit. Vision is generally good out of both cockpit positions and sliding rectangular doors offer access to the passenger cabin. The cockpit and passenger cabin are separated by a solid wall for privacy and passenger comfort is expanded through use of cushioned seating, an in-flight entertainment system and air conditioning. The engines are mounted above the passenger cabin in the usual way and drive a five-bladed main rotor atop a short mast as well as a four-bladed tail rotor facing starboard. The undercarriage is retractable and consists of a traditional three-legged, wheeled arrangement.\n\r\nThe AW189 cockpit brings about use of FLIR (Foward-Looking Infra-Red), Night Vision Goggle (NVG) support, SATellite COMmunications (SATCOM), HF/V/UHF radio, AIS naval transponder, four-axis autopilot, a Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) solution and flight data recorders. There are four large, full-color Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) providing an all-glass approach (fitted in pairs ahead of both cockpit positions). Weather and search radars are also integrated into the design as is a Moving Map Display (MMD).\n\r\nAgustaWestland is targeting the AW189 to offshore drilling companies where access to platforms requires use of a capable, reliable rotary-wing system.  Range is, therefore, an important inherent quality of such a product and auxiliary fuel tanks are optional, added to the fuselage of the AW189 to help increase range. Additionally, the powerplant and airframe were designed with the rigors of over-water service in mind as well as the harsh environments to be encountered that come with such operating territory. For emergencies, the AW189 features an emergency flotation system (forced water landings) and an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) for added piece of mind.\n\r\nBeyond its offshore potential, the AW189 can also serve law enforcement and coast guard entities due to its inherent qualities. Available equipment includes life rafts, search lights, cargo hooks and fast-roping kits to suit the mission need. Its cabin can also be converted to serve as a MEDEVAC platform for litters and associated staff.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Leonardo AW189", "aircraft_type": "Medium-Lift Multirole Helicopter"}, {"id": "c8064027-9697-41de-aa14-59743484584a", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian defense industry has recovered nicely from its dark ages following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The country has made considerable headway in the field of 5th Generation Fighters, advanced bomber concepts, infantry small arms, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Its ongoing war with neighboring Ukraine has given Russia an active battlefield for which to test its various new developments - case-in-point being the STC Orlan-10, an Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance-minded (ISR) UAV which is known to have been used in the War in Donbass.\n\r\nThe Orland-10 operates through the A-95 series gasoline-fueled engine. it is launched by way of catapult (rail) and retrieved through a simply parachute delivery operation. The aircraft can reach speeds nearing 150 kph and can remain airborne for up to 16 hours, delivering data in real-time to operators on the ground out to ranges of 600 kilometers. The system operates at an altitude of about 5,000 meters. Its take-off weight is 15 kilograms and the aircraft can carry a payload of sensors and optics weighing 6 kilograms.\n\r\nIts outward design is conventional as fixed-wing UAVs go. The fuselage makes up its length with the motor fitted to the nose section driving a two-bladed propeller unit. The wing mainplanes are shoulder-mounted over the fuselage ahead of midships. The tail unit incorporates a simple single-finned arrangement with two low-mounted horizontal planes. Since the drone is rail-launched and parachute-recovered, no complex undercarriage is needed in its operation. The aircraft is transported in a hard case and assembled prior to launching. This involves connecting main and tail planes to the fuselage and adjusting any payload options. The catapult rail system also requires some light assembly.\n\r\nAs stated, the Orlan-10 series has been actively used in the fighting in Donbass between Russian elements and Ukrainian Army forces. Several have been claimed downed by Ukrainian forces since its use in the region began in - or around - 2014.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "STC Orlan-10", "aircraft_type": "Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance (ISR) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)"}, {"id": "fe15a50c-1cde-406c-a3c8-20b8edd7321e", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-34 (NATO reporting name of \"Fullback\") is a dedicated Fourth Generation two-seat fighter-bomber/strike fighter platform based on the successful Su-27 \"Flanker\" air superiority fighter series for the Russian Air Force. The Flanker family of aircraft was born out of the Sukhoi Design Bureau in the 1970s and entered service in December of 1984, having since spawned into a handful of capable combat-minded roles including the Su-33 (\"Flanker-D\") navalized multi-role variant and the Su-35 long-range, air superiority/strike series (\"Flanker-E\"). While being largely based on the preceding Su-27 design (exported worldwide as the \"Su-30\") and incorporating some of its key qualities, the Su-34 is regarded as an all-new, independent aircraft design as it is heavily modified and intended for the strike role as primary with air superiority being a secondary quality of the design.\n\r\nThe Su-34 began life under the Sukhoi \"T-10V\" product designation, an initiative brought about by a 1980s Soviet Air Force requirement for a new, long endurance, high-speed tactical bomber intended to supersede the outgoing Sukhoi Su-24 \"Fencer\" series in the same role. The Sukhoi concern looked to its new Su-27 airframe as a possible starting point, the aircraft now beginning to take hold in useful numbers across the Soviet air inventory. The airframe was a excellent commodity and flexible enough to modify for the requirement, as proven through the promising - though ultimately abandoned - twin-seat T-10KM-2 navalized training aircraft once intended for the Soviet Navy. Sukhoi engineers felt comfortable with retaining much of the Su-27 arrangement with only a new forward fuselage added to the mix. As the Su-27 family of aircraft relied on a single-seat configuration, the fuselage was allowed a nice cylindrical design shape. However, for the new fighter-bomber endeavor, this would be modified through a new approach in which two pilots - seated side-by-side - would be added to a widened cockpit. To this, engineers then installed forward wing canards ahead of the main wing elements intended to improved stability and increase maneuverability. The Su-27's Lyulka series turbofan engines were uprated for greater power in the new Sukhoi initiative. The ultimate goal for the program was to develop a competent strike platform while retaining the excellent fighter qualities (handling and performance) of the Su-27 family. The Sukhoi program ultimately yielded the first T-10V-1 prototype form (born from an existing Su-27UB) which went airborne for the first time on April 13th, 1990. The T-10V designator was then dropped in favor of \"Su-27IB\" to indicate the type's new fighter-bomber role (\"Istrebeetel'-bombardirovschchik\"). The Su-27IB was first formally unveiled in 1992 and a second prototype followed, taking to the air on December 18th, 1993. By this time, the series was assigned the officially Russian Air Force designation of \"Su-34\" and further codenamed \"Fullback\" by NATO.\n\r\nThe most obvious design departure of the Su-34 when compared to the Su-27 was its larger cockpit cabin and forward fuselage assembly. The cockpit was deliberately designed as a large, comfortable operating space for the two crew and applicable systems. The area aft of the cockpit would feature a full in-flight galley and lavatory to help offset the fatigue and physical stresses undertaken by the crew over long sorties - the crew can stand or lay down as needed. The crew was made up of a primary pilot and his weapons operator, seated in a side-by-side arrangement (as in the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark fighter-bomber). The use of two crew allowed the mission workload to be spread about, lessening crew fatigue (and inherent mistakes) while a consistently pressurized cockpit allowed for a working environment not requiring cumbersome oxygen masks to be worn. The resulting Sukhoi aircraft retained the wings, tail unit, fixed intake engine nacelles and aft-fuselage of the original Su-27, incorporating the new forward fuselage and a modified rear \"stinger\" housing a rear-facing/scanning radar array. The Su-34 makes use of the prominent rearward-looking radar system housed in a \"stinger\" at the rear of the fuselage to counter any approaching enemy threats in pursuit of the aircraft. The undercarriage consists of two main landing gear legs and a nose leg, the former outfitted with a pair of inline wheels to offset the added weight of the new design while the latter makes use of a dual-wheel, side-by-side arrangement. These were different from the simpler configuration of the Su-27.\n\r\nThe Su-34's cockpit is a modern, all-glass effort dominated by CRT displays and sporting the latest in Russian avionics technology as well as digital processing systems. Views from within the cockpit are relatively good thanks to the large clear canopy with only a forward frame splitting the frontal view - though the raised fuselage spine (required for larger internal volume) defeats any rearward visibility for the crew. The cockpit's noticeable duck-bill type design approach features a pronounced \"nose-down\" appearance which aids the crew in taxiing actions and landing of the aircraft. Onboard systems propel the Su-34 (and the Russian Air Force for that matter) into the modern age and feature real-time digital battlefield management systems, advanced targeting and tracking options and a vastly improved navigation suite over previous Russian attempts. Onboard automation extends the overall value of the aircraft by allowing the crew to concentrate on other facets of the mission at hand - engine status, crew health and scanning/incoming threats can all be handled by the aircraft - autopilot is truly autonomous requiring only directional input, the aircraft capable of guiding itself to a point. The crew (as well as engine intakes and internal fuselage fuel cells) are armored for protection against enemy ground fire when in the low-level attack role. Each operator is also afforded the typical Russian helmet-mounted sight and ejection seating. HUD  (Head-Up Display) is present and stealth features have been subtly incorporated throughout the airframe (including use of a radar-absorbing skin coat) - though the Su-34 remains a largely conventional Fourth Generation aircraft design and not a true stealth design (as in the now-retired F-117 Nighthawk).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-34 (Fullback)", "aircraft_type": "Fighter-Bomber / Long Range Strike Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "4e254afe-397e-40ea-93c3-dd828bfb1a95", "year_model": "2014", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-35 (NATO: \"Flanker-E\") is the latest (2013) variant of the successful Su-27 \"Flanker\" family of air superiority aircraft. The original Su-27 was born in a late 1970s Soviet Air Force initiative to counter the American McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle air superiority mount.  Since then, the type's tactical value has broadened considerably in the ground attack role and the line has even spawned the navy-centric carrier-based Su-33. The Su-35 is marketed as a true 4th/4.5th Generation multi-role performer built upon the strong and proven qualities of the Su-27 line - retaining its air-to-air prowess while incorporating advanced ground attack features. The Su-35 emerged from the modified Su-27M developmental series to which the finalized \"Su-35\" designation came about in 1993 though the aircraft was already publicly displayed by the time of the 1992 Farnborough Air Show. Ten total prototypes of the Su-35 were then built, four being conversions from existing Su-27s while the rest being new-build aircraft beginning official Russian evaluation in 1996. The Su-35 differs from the original Su-27 in its inherent multi-role capabilities, highly modernized avionics (including the new Tikhomirov NIIP Irbis phased antenna array), long range endurance, thrust vectoring (and new) NPO Saturn 117S engines and streamlined aerodynamic qualities. First flight was recorded in June of 1998 and, after an extended period of testing, formally entered production after adoption by the Russian Air Force as the \"Su-35S\" in 2010. \n\r\nThe aircraft features an integrated in-flight refueling probe, provision for ECM (Electronic CounterMeasure) pods, upgraded and more powerful engines, larger wing surface areas and a forward and rear-facing Phazotron radar system capable of simultaneous tracking of 24 targets up to 62 miles (100km) away over uneven terrain. An additional auxiliary internal reserve fuel tank has been added as well to bring about the require operational range. The cockpit sports an updated color CRT display as well as HUD (Head-Up Display) along with digital fly-by-wire (FBW) capability with quadruple redundancy - the onboard computers able to to find four different ways to achieve the desired flight control action. Avionics include an Irbis-E passive phased array radar system. The advanced nature of the Su-35 nets it the formal classification of \"4th Generation Fighter\" - though its true capabilities go well beyond the original/current crop of 4th Generation mounts while falling short of the standard adopted for true 5th Generation mount (such as the American Lockheed F-22 Raptor series).\n\r\nOutwardly, the Su-35 retains much of the clean sleek lines of the Su-27. It is a noticeably large aircraft with well-swept wings, a long running forward fuselage and side-by-side engine layout. The Su-35 makes use of a nose cone to house its powerful tracking radar system. Twin vertical tails, each sitting atop the engine installations, are fitted aft on the fuselage in the usual way. Cockpit visibility is excellent for a machine of this class. The engines exhaust through thrust vectoring rings at the extreme aft section of the fuselage, providing excellent maneuverability and allowing the Su-35 to complete moves off limits to other 4th Generation mounts. The Su-35 also features the Flanker-style stinger at the tail - an extended portion of fuselage housing a rear-looking radar facility.\n\r\nDepending on production mark, power is provided by 2 x Saturn 1117S afterburning turbofan engines with the aforementioned thrust vector control. The engines output at 32,000lb thrust each on full thrust and roughly 19,400lb each on dry thrust alone. The thrust vectoring system allows for excellent agility when compared to the conventional Su-27 mount, the aircraft able to make tighter turns for evasion in a close-range dogfight or for out maneuvering incoming homing/guided missiles (the Russians have adopted an agile-minded approach to modern dogfighting unlike the speed/stealth-minded approach of the West). The Su-35S lists a top speed of Mach 2.25 at altitude, roughly 1,500 miles per hour and range, on internal fuel, is out to 1,900 nautical miles while Su-35S can ferry out to 2,400 nautical miles. The Su-35S will have the capability to operate at service ceilings of 60,000 feet and sport a 55,100 feet-per-minute climb rate.\n\r\nAs a multi-role fighter platform, the Su-35S benefits from the full array of Russian-sponsored ordnance options across no fewer than 14 weapon hardpoints, 12 underwing and under-fuselage - all external. A 30mm GSh-30 internal cannon is standard for close-in fighting (150 projectiles allocated) while the wingtips are reserved for the R-73 (AA-11 \"Archer\") short-range air-to-air missile. Additionally, the wingtip rails can be removed and replaced with specialized ECM pods as mission parameters dictate. The remaining hardpoints will be home to various air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, anti-radiation missiles, anti-ship missiles, laser-guided bombs, guided rocket pods, unguided rocket pods, and precision weapons as needed.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-35 (Flanker-E / Super Flanker)", "aircraft_type": "Multirole Heavy Combat Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "9296377a-0fe4-4c3a-9260-73acfd0ea1f3", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tEntering the field of military-minded drone aircraft is the Persian Gulf nation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with its rather ambitious \"United 40\" Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by ADCOM Systems.

It is conceivable that the system may also evolve along a more direct combat platform line, able to carry munitions into combat and self-designate its targets - currently, four presented underwing hardpoints will serve to carry mission pods (100kg each station). The total payload capability (including internal) is to be 2,200lb.\n\r\nPerhaps the most unique physical quality of the United 40 is its serpentine-like fuselage which bends down aft of the forward section to create a noticeable valley. The empennage is then slightly elevated to complete the shape, mounting a single vertical tail fin without any tailplanes present. A three-bladed propeller blade is noted at the extreme rear of the design, arranged in a \"pusher\" configuration. Intakes are also found at either side of the extreme fuselage aft. The main wing units of the United 40 are also of particular note for there are two individual mainplanes - one mounted forward and the other mounted aft. The forward pair sits higher than the aft pair when views in profile and all are of a low-aspect ratio design similar to that of gliders. Dimensionally, the United 40 is given a length of 11 meters, a wingspan of 20 meters and a height of 4.4 meters.

The HESA Shahed-129 series is a dual-role platform capable of reconnaissance work and attack. It was developed by the Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center of Iran with production handled by HESA (and based in the earlier \"Shahed-123\" which became a redesignation of the \"HESA-100\"). It appeared during September 2012, remains in active production and may have been procured by the Syrian government for its long-running civil war campaign begun in 2011. The Shahed-129 was debuted in mid-2012.\n\r\nExternally, the Shahed-129 seems to mimic the form of foreign types like the Israeli Hermes 450 and British Watchkeeper UAVs and can be assumed to offer similar over-battlefield capabilities. A tubular fuselage is used to house the engine, fuel stores, avionics and reconnaissance-minded mission payload. A \"blister\" assembly housing the primary optics fit is set under the aircraft, aft of the nose section, offering unobstructed 360-degree views. The wings are shoulder-mounted along the fuselage sides and of a straight design with each supporting a single hardpoint. The hardpoints hold a twin-rail launcher to carry up to two Sadid-1 missiles each - giving the Shahed-129 a four-shot capability. The undercarriage is wheeled though fixed in place during flight (as in the American Predator). The tail is made up of two outward-canted vertical fins and the engine drives a three-bladed unit in a \"pusher\" configuration at rear.

Range is limited by the communications technology in play but enough to provide a useful patrolling capability for the Iranian Army and Navy services. Its dual-role (reconnaissance and attack) design allows for active patrolling of a given area and direct- attack capability from a single platform. Missile attacks can focus on land-based targets (such as vehicles and fortifications) as well as sea-borne ones like enemy patrol ships - the latter crucial for maintaining control over Persian Gulf water routes.

To this point, the project represents an advanced, ambitious project which could sink or swim the aircraft firm which already suffers from a down economy and drop in air travel in general. Should it succeed as planned, the 787 sets the stage to become the top-performing jet airliner that Boeing has ever produced. The program was launched back in 2004 though first flight was not achieved until late 2009, some two years late. The 787 was unveiled in a \"roll-out\" ceremony on July 8th, 2007. Before it had even flown, the 787 became the fastest-selling wide-body class airliner in history, perhaps a sign of better things to come for the Boeing Company. The Dreamliner will wield parts, materials and entire components through a multitude of national and international companies across the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, India and Italy among others.\n\nFirst Operators\n\r\nAs of this writing, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has not entered operational service with any one airliner firm. All Nippon Airways Company, Ltd of Japan is slated to be the first commercial operator of the Boeing product. These 787s are expected to hit the airways in the latter portion of 2010 if the program continues on track.\n\r\nSome 54 airliner firms are expected to begin 787 Dreamliner operations between late 2010 through 2017. On paper, the two largest expected customers will be ILFC (International Lease Finance Corporation) of the United States with 67 examples and Al Nippon of Japan with 55 examples. Some top names to utilize the Dreamliner will include Aeroflot, AeroMexico, Air Berlin, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Kuwait Airways, British Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Qantas and Virgin Atlantic Airways. Each operator will make their own respective selection as to engine brands (General Electric or Rolls Royce) and all of these are slated to use the 787-8 and 787-9 production model types.\n\nBoeing 787 Dreamliner Walk-Around\n\r\nTo the casual observer, the 787 does not offer much in the way of changes, at least from an external perspective. The design is, in fact, quite conventional in appearance despite some early Dreamliner design interpretations featuring a fashionable and futuristic airframe. The fuselage is tubular with the flightdeck situated at the extreme forward of the design. The conical nose is noticeably short and the cockpit sports four large window panels. The two center windscreen panels are afforded individual windshield wipers. There are four crew/passenger access doors to either fuselage side. The first set is immediately aft of the cockpit with the second set just a ways down the fuselage ahead of each wingroot. The third, is set just aft of the main wing assemblies with the fourth set ahead of the empennage. The wings themselves are low-mounted in typical commercial airliner fashion and sport noticeable dihedral. Wing sweep (approximately 32.2 degrees) is noticeably excessive along the leading edge and less so along the trailing edge. The empennage is also conventional and dominated by the tall shark-like vertical fin. Horizontal planes extend out of each aft fuselage side and showcase their own dihedral. The fuselage tapers off into a sharp cone past the tail. The undercarriage is made up of a two-wheeled nose landing gear leg and a pair of 4-wheeled main landing gears. The main legs are fitted under each wingroot with the nose leg fitted under and aft of the cockpit floor.\n\r\nInternally, the 787 makes use of composites, aluminum, titanium and steel, producing a light-weight airframe in the process (theoretically improving range). The fuselage will rely heavily on composite construction and make the 787 the first commercial passenger airliner to do so. The use of composites has come under some scrutiny from outside parties when relating its use with lighting strikes, visible fatigue markers, crash survivability and moisture absorbance. Boeing, of course, counters these fears with the data they have available.\n\nThe 787 Cockpit\n\r\nThe 787 Dreamliner flightdeck naturally sports state-of-the-art equipment. The instrument panel is dominated by a set of four large liquid-crystal customizable multi-function displays (MFDs) similar to those found on military aircraft for decades. Engine controls are located between the pilot and copilot along an easily accessible central console. Each pilot position is redundant to an extent and feature a traditional yoke control column (as opposed to the side stick controls found in the Airbus 380 and in military aircraft). Heads-Up Displays (HUDs) are fixed to the cockpit ceiling directly ahead of each pilot's sight line and supply pertinent in-flight information on-the-fly and without the need for the pilots to take their eyes off of the air ahead. The curved cockpit ceiling also contains easily accessible control systems.\n\nDreamliner Orders\n\r\nAs of this writing, some 851 Dreamliners are on order and most of these are of the 787-8 type (656 examples) whilst the rest are of the 787-9 type (195 examples). No orders for the 787-3 have been placed as of yet. Orders began as early as 2004 with 56 being placed. 2005 saw 235 examples placed on order while 2006 netted a further 157. A total of 369 orders were placed in 2007 while 93 came onboard in 2008. 2009 saw 59 examples ordered.\n\nProduction\n\r\nTaking a page out of those expensive and complicated military aircraft in today's skies, Boeing is utilizing subcontractors to produce individual sections and components of the Dreamliner with final production being handled by Boeing. As of this writing, only two 787s have been completed with first flight achieved on December 15th, 2009. The 787-3 is expected to cost between $150 - $155.5 million USD per example while the 787-8 will range in the $161 - $171.5 realm. The 787-9 is priced out between $194 - 205.5 million.\n\n787 Variants - the 787-3, 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10\n\r\nThe 787-3 is the short-range model of the 787 Dreamliner family. The 787-3 features a standard operating crew of two personnel made up of the pilot and copilot. Seating is expected to be between 290 and 330 passengers depending on the cabin seat arrangements. Length is listed at 186 feet with a wingspan of 170 feet and a height of 55 feet, 6 inches. The fuselage measures in at 19 feet, 5 inches high with a width of 18 feet, 11 inches. The cabin itself measures in at 18 feet across. These fuselage measurements are the same across the 787-3, 787-8 and the 787-9 model types. Empty weight for the 787-3 is listed at 223,000lbs while a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 375,000 is reported. Cruising speed will be approximately 561 miles per hour while a maximum speed of 587 miles per hour is possible. Range will fall between 2,880 and 3,510 miles. Service ceiling is 43,000 feet across all three Dreamliner models. The 787-3 is intended to replace the 757-300 and 767-200 Boeing products as well as threaten the future of the categorically similar Airbus A300 and A310 in use. As of this writing, no 787-3s have been ordered and no date is set for its availability.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Boeing 787 (Dreamliner)", "aircraft_type": "Wide-Body Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "02ad4ab1-fe2c-4d8a-99bc-086591e334be", "year_model": "2011", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile largely recognized for its strong military hardware roots, Sukhoi introduced their \"Superjet 100\" line of regional passenger airliners in 2011 with launch customer Armavia of Armenia. In June of 2013, the concern managed a new milestone when it passed examples of its Superjet 100 to the first western customer in Mexican Interjet. To date (2013), twenty-eight examples of the twin-engined, all-modern airliner have been produced and this through a once-unheard of international effort with participants including European and American firms. 234 units are on order with some sixteen having been delivered to date (2013). Intended operators are Aeroflot, Finance Leasing Company, Lao Central Airlines, Orient Thai Airlines, Sky Aviation, Moskovia Airlines and Transaero among others. The Superjet 100 is produced under the Sukhoi Civil Aircraft banner.\n\r\nThe Superjet 100 program involves technology and input from a variety of major defense industry players such as Alenia Aermacchi of Italy, SNECMA of France, The Boeing Company of the United States, Thales Group of France and Honeywell of the United States. United Aircraft Corporation of Russia is the primary contractor with engines split between SNECMA of France and NPO Saturn of Russia. Western marketing is also assisted by Alenia Aermacchi through the Superjet International brand label.\n\r\nSukhoi developed the Superjet 100 to not only compete with western passenger offerings glutting the global market but also to replace the aging fleet of Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-134 and Yakovlev Yak-42 airliners (recognized in NATO nomenclature as \"Crusty\" and \"Clobber\" respectively). As such, the Superjet 100 manages a fully-modern, all-glass digital cockpit, fly-by-wire control and engines having been introduced as recently as 2008. The cockpit includes five large color displays through a clean instrument panel and a console separating the two crew. Controls are of the side-stick variety providing a very modern look. The passenger cabin showcases a single aisle with seats flanking the walk and overhead compartments as normally seen on other aircraft of this type. Its overall external configuration is highly conventional with a very well streamlined fuselage and forward-set flight deck. The fuselage is lined with porthole windows for the passenger cabin and sports typical entry/exit doors. Wings are swept and low-mounted on the fuselage, each managing an underslung engine nacelle. The empennage is typical of the aircraft class, fielding a single vertical tail fin with low-set horizontal planes. The undercarriage is designed for typical runway abuse and includes a pair of dual-wheeled main legs and a dual-wheeled nose leg. All are retractable at their respective positions.\n\r\nWork on the Superjet 100 began as early as 2002 in which Boeing and Sukhoi entered into a limited agreement to design and develop a new regional jet. Boeing would supply consulting/marketing  services whilst Sukhoi would head all else. Other contractors then fell into place through a truly international effort ranging from the United States and Canada to Europe and Asia. A prototype was cleared in November of 2004 and this was followed by formal Russian government backing in August of 2005 (the program would cost approximately $1.4 USD billion). Flight testing began in January of 2007 paving the way for powerplant development (the engines tested through a modified Ilyushin IL-76 carrier platform). With a prototype completed, first flight was recorded on May 19th, 2008 and development ran into 2009 while orders both locally and abroad were secured. Three prototypes were completed by the end of 2009. It was during this year that the product was formally showcased at the Paris Air Show to help drum up customer interest in the product. Russian certification was granted in 2010, to which a forth prototype was added, and European certification followed in 2012.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SSJ 100)", "aircraft_type": "Twin-Engine Regional Passenger Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "628a978c-b26e-49d6-b3b5-a972ad7a21e1", "year_model": "2010", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kamov Ka-52 \"Alligator\" (Hokum-B) is an upgraded form of the original Ka-50 \"Hokum\" attack helicopter line. While the Ka-50 utilized a single-seat cockpit, the most notable difference in the new mark is the twin-seat, side-by-side cockpit. Development of this attack helicopter began in 1994 leading to a first flight recorded on June 25th, 1997. While the Ka-52 includes a radar suite, additional crewmember, and all-new designation it more or less retains the same form and function as well as armament capabilities of the original. Additionally, the platform supports all-weather, day/night attack environments due to its various upgrades that include FLIR, TV sighting, helmet-mounted sighting, laser rangefinder, and mast-mounted radar antenna.\n\r\nThe Ka-52 is billed as an armed reconnaissance and combat platform able to take on the roles of assault, Close-Air Support (CAS), convoy protection, and armed patrolling. The helicopter maintains its weaponry under its short wingstub assemblies which allow for four underwing hardpoints. Onboard countermeasures, including signature reduction features, chaff/flare dispensers, and crew/critical systems armoring enhances battlefield survivability. Each pilot is also afforded K-37-800M shock-absorbing ejection seats. The twin-seat arrangement sports control redundancy meaning either pilot can manage the flight control aspects of the helicopter. The avionics suite is all-modern (complete with a high level of automation for reduced crew workloads) and the weapons suite flexible to support a broad range of weaponry. Attention has also been given to reduced maintenance and repair times by providing for better accessibility of key systems and components. \n\r\nThe Alligator features the Kamov helicopter trademark coaxial main rotors arrangement (2 x three-bladed systems) which eliminate the need for a countering tail rotor unit (this also increased battlefield survivability to an extent). These main rotors are driven by 2 x Klimov VK-2500 series turboshaft engines which support \"hot-and-high\" operations as well as cold weather service. Performance includes a maximum speed of 300 kmh with a cruising speed nearing 260 kmh. Ferry range is 1,100 kilometers with a combat radius of about 460 kilometers. Its operational service ceiling reaches 5,500 meters.\n\r\nThe Ka-52 carries a 30mm 2A42-1 cannon along the starboard side of its fuselage. There is limited traversal given which requires the pilots to position the entire aircraft in the direction of fire but overall accuracy is said to be better than that of a turreted chin gun seen in other modern attack helicopters. Beyond this standard installation, the wingstubs of the helicopter support Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), rockets, rocket pods, gun pods, and cannon pods as required.\n\r\nTo date, the Ka-52 has only been adopted by the Russian Air Force with possible plans to feature it in the Russian Navy as well dependent upon successful procurement of a new amphibious warship / helicopter carrier. The Air Force is planning on a Ka-52 stock of 140 helicopters with the Navy adding a possible 40 more units.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kamov Ka-52 Alligator (Hokum-B)", "aircraft_type": "Two-Seat Armed Reconnaissance / Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "26a06c01-a2e2-4e91-abdf-4e255455b343", "year_model": "2010", "description": "\r\n        \tAdvanced jet-powered trainers with secondary strike roles are becoming an ever more growing presence on the modern battlefield due to their initial procurement costs (this usually in some great number), long-term maintenance costs and inherent dual-role functionality. Such aircraft allow a potential operator the ability to train all-new generations of airmen while maintaining a limited attack capability in their fleet of lightweight systems - making them highly appealing to budget-concious interested parties. The Yak-130 (NATO: \"Mitten\") is Yakovlev's entry into the crowded field, bringing with it a strong company lineage dating back to 1934 and modern-minded modular capabilities that have primarily garnered it the interest of the Russian Air Force to date. Irkut Corporation handles manufacture of the Yak-130 though an export-minded derivative for Western clients is also being developed as the M-346 \"Master\" under the Alenia Aermacchi brand label of Italy.\n\r\nOne of the key qualities of aircraft systems like the relatively new Yak-130 is the ability to recreate the operating environment and handling of modern fighting jets. For the Russian Air Force, this also includes mimicking the qualities of their upcoming Sukhoi T-50 PAK FA 5th Generation high-performance stealth fighter as well as current 4th Generation mounts already in inventory. The PAK FA stealth fighter is a direct competitor to the American F-22 Raptor and only one of a now-growing number of such aircraft in the world. Similarly, the Chinese are working on their Chengdu J-20 twin engine initiative.\n\r\nDesign of the Yak-130 is highly conventional for aircraft of this class yet wholly modern. The fuselage is well-contoured for the high-performance role, featuring a pointed beak-like nose cone assembly, forward-set cockpit and dual-engine layout. In two-seat versions of the aircraft, the pilots sit in tandem with the student (primary) pilot in the front cockpit and the instructor (secondary) pilot in the rear cockpit. Both benefit from the aircraft's use of a large unobstructed canopy which rewards with excellent vision to all regions of the aircraft save for the slightly blocked rear view due to the fuselage's spine. The wings stem from extended forward root edges along each cockpit side and are lightly-swept along the leading edges and straight along their trailing edges, both assemblies able to support up to 3,000 kilograms of external ordnance with the two innermost hardpoints being plumbed for fuel jettisonable fuel stores. The Yak-130 makes use of a pair of conventional horizontal tailplanes and a single vertical tail fin, the latter emanating from above and between the two exhaust ports. The dual-engine layout is aspirated by a pair of well-recessed, oblong air intakes fitted to either side (and aft) of the rear-most cockpit area. The undercarriage is fully retractable in the usual sense and consists of two single-wheeled main landing gear legs and a single-wheeled nose landing gear leg. As detailed below, the Yak-130 comes in a twin-seat form and a single-seat form, the latter for more dedicated roles.\n\r\nThe Yak-130 is powered by a pair of Progress AI-222-25 series turbofans with each installation rated up to 5,500lb of thrust. These supply the airframe with a listed top speed of 644 miles per hour (cruise speed is in the general vicinity of 550 miles per hour) while the aircraft's internal fuel allows for an operational range of 1,600 miles. Its pressurized cabin and high-thrust engines allows operations up to 42,600 feet. Rate-of-climb is a reported 10,000 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nWhile inherently a two-seat advanced jet trainer first, the Yak-130 retains a somewhat limited - albeit still potent - capability to launch self-supported strikes against both ground and air target thanks to its multirole nature. The two-seat approach ultimately divides mission loads between the two pilots in the attack role while also bringing along a \"second pair of eyes\" beyond that of just the single pilot (as well as any onboard sensor equipment being fitted). Light strikes serve such a lightweight airframe well as the multi-faceted wings can take on mixed ordnance loads that include air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, anti-radar missiles, laser-guided munitions, conventional drop bombs, gun pods and rocket pods as well as additional fuel stores (this across nine external hard points, three under each wing). A modern approach to design ensures quick turn-around times between sorties and compatibility with the latest in Russian military hardware. Beyond its light strike role, the Yak-130 can also be outfitted with various sensor and surveillance equipment to undertake general reconnaissance as needed. Such flexibility is at the heart of advanced trainer/light strike mounts like the Yak-130 and copied across like-type aircraft all over the world.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-130 (Mitten)", "aircraft_type": "Advanced Jet Trainer / Light Strike Aircraft"}, {"id": "744ada58-a6b8-4dcf-bc63-667477b0102e", "year_model": "2009", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov concern of Ukraine holds a long-running, storied existence, particularly in the large aircraft domain where it has manufactured some of the largest cargo haulers in aviation history. The An-148 is a smaller addition to the company product line and serves primarily as a regional jet-powered passenger airliner (though several variants expand on the type's usefulness). The An-148 has seen manufacture in both Ukraine and Russia under the Antonov and Voronezh Aircraft brand labels with some 32 having been completed to date (2014) - some 56 having been ordered. Operators currently include Rossiya Airlines and Ukraine International Airlines among a growing pool of others worldwide. First flight of a prototype occurred on December 17th, 2004 and the product was officially introduced on June 2nd, 2009. Comparable aircraft to the An-148 include the market mainstay Canadian Bombardier CRJ700, the in-development Chinese COMAC ARJ21 and the emerging Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100.\n\r\nThe An-148 takes on something of a unique appearance as jet airliners go, particularly in the selection of a high-mounted, swept-back wing assembly. This allows for the considerably large turbofan engines - one to a wing - to be underslung beneath each wing and held ahead of the leading edge while using a low-profile undercarriage. The cockpit sits aft of a pointed, short nose cone which provides good visibility from the cockpit of the surrounding airspace. The fuselage is expectedly tubular on the whole while being tapered at the rear to which a T-style tail assembly is featured. Rectangular doors along the fuselage sides allow for passenger entry/exit and the fuselage sides (complete with integrated staircases) are also dotted with vision ports. The undercarriage is wholly-retractable and consists of two double-tired main landing gear legs and a double-tired nose leg, the latter under the cockpit floor. The An-148 promotes a low ground clearance when at rest to which the engine nacelles are served well by the high-mounted wings. The cockpit takes a largely digital approach featuring five color displays and dual controls. Power is served through 2 x Progress D-436 turbofan engines developing 15,060lbs of thrust. Based on published numbers, cruising speeds reach approximately 500 miles per hour depending on variant. A typical operating crew is two and a single- or dual-class passenger arrangement allows for between 68 and 99 persons to be carried (or cargo in their place).\n\r\nThe base An-148 model is represented by the An-148-100A designation which seats some 70 to 80 persons in a single-class, single-aisle seating arrangement. A two-class internal arrangement seats a useful 68 passengers. The An-148-100Bc is a longer-range variant which increases operations out to 2,200 miles (from the 1,300 miles showcased through the base An-148-100A). The An-148-100E is another long-range model with an increased Maximum Take-Off Weight and can reach out to 2,700 miles. The IrAn-148 is an Iranian market airliner form which is locally assembled from kits delivered from Antonov by the HESA concern.\n\r\nBeyond he An-148-100 family is the An-158 which is given a lengthened fuselage for greater internal volume and, thusly, room for more passenger seating - up to 99 in a single-class arrangement. The An-168 is a business market passenger hauler with variable seating numbers depending on the configuration and the An-178 is a dedicated cargo hauler.\n\r\nThe Antonov An-148 currently serves several civilian markets in the Ukraine, Russia and the European Union with other possible operators in talks.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-148", "aircraft_type": "Regional Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "091b35cb-427a-4445-aec7-fd464f37f7d3", "year_model": "2009", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mikoyan MiG-29K (NATO = \"Fulcrum-D\") is a navalized variant of the successful Mikoyan MiG-29 Fulcrum family of fighters. The navalized form was originally developed to a 1980s Soviet Navy carrier-based fighter requirement. While the Soviet Navy eventually settled on the larger Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" series (as the \"Su-33\"), the MiG-29K design has recently seen growing interest by both the Russian and Indian navies thanks largely to the acquisition by the Indian Navy of the ex-Kiev class Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier (to become the INS Vikramaditya in December of 2012). A dozen MiG-29K aircraft were included as part of the deal due to their more compact size, lower procurement cost and advanced capabilities. In turn, the Russian Navy has decided to replace its aged and exceedingly expensive fleet of Su-33 carrier-based fighters with the newer budget-friendly MiG-29K models by 2015.\n\r\nBoth Sukhoi and Mikoyan, longtime aircraft suppliers to the Soviet/Russian Air Force (and notable rivals to one another), submitted their proposed designs to the Soviet Navy for a standard carrier-based fighter platform. The original land-based Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker was developed to counter the American McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle while the Mikoyan MiG-29 Fulcrum was developed to counter the American General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. As such, the Su-27 was a much larger aircraft with broadened inherent capabilities while the MiG-29 was noticeably more compact and cheaper to produce and maintain. Both Soviet-era designs proved successful (and highly capable) and went on to see considerable sales to Soviet-allied states and nations. Within time, the Soviet Navy required a similarly capable carrier-based fighter and the two Soviet concerns took to modifying their land-based designs as the MiG-29M and Su-27K respectively. The Soviet Navy eventually settled on the larger Su-27-based design though no more than 25 of the Su-33 were ever procured for the Soviet Navy's four Kiev-class aircraft carriers.\n\r\nFor the MiG-29 design, a reinforced undercarriage was devised for the rigors of deck operation and folding wings of greater area were introduced for improved storage aboard the space-strapped Soviet carriers. Anti-corrosion coatings were used where possible to help counter the effects of the salty sea. Additionally, recovery was made possible by the installation of an arrestor hook under the tail unit.\n\r\nAt this time in Soviet Naval history, the Kiev-class of aircraft carriers were a mix of \"fighting cruiser\" and dedicated aircraft carrier. As such, the bow of the Kiev-class family was reserved for offensive armament in the form of cannon, missiles and torpedo launchers to help contend with enemy air, surface and submarine threats while the port side of the design held the angled stern-to-port flight deck. These carriers were principally designed to operate the Yakovlev Yak-38 Forger VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) jump jets and navy helicopters which required little-to-no runway for their take-off and recovery. With the advent of more dedicated navalized aircraft, a ski jump ramp would have to be utilized to facilitate take-off (a feature common to many European aircraft carrier designs). The initial navalized MiG-29 prototype became  the \"MiG-29KVP\" and first flight was recorded on August 21st, 1982.\n\r\nA more modified form - the \"MiG-29M\" - soon followed this design and, for the Soviet Navy requirement, the system was redesignated as the MiG-29K (\"K\" indicating its \"ship-based\" usage in Russian). The new MiG design incorporated HOTAS (Hands On Throttle and Stick) functionality, an advanced multi-function active homing radar in the nose, revised air intakes, increased wing area and a retained capability to deliver precision-guided air-to-ground weaponry. Three color multi-function displays were utilized in the cockpit for a truly modernized, all-glass approach. The MiG-29K would, therefore, be more than a fleet defense fighter and could undertake ground strike sorties as needed - similar in scope to the American McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. A two-seat derivative was also developed to facilitate training of new MiG-29K pilots. The second cockpit reduced internal fuel volume and thusly limited operational ranges while some of the combat qualities of the MiG-29K design were lessened to a degree.\n\r\nThe modified MiG-29K recorded its first flight on July 23rd, 1988 and completed its first carrier landing in November of the following year along the deck of the Admiral Kuznetsov. More testing followed to work out the expected project kinks and the program received a major setback with the fall of the Soviet Union as a world communist power by 1991. While delayed, the MiG-29K was never abandoned in full and by the time Russian military financing was in check, the MiG-29K would still have a role to play for Mikoyan continued its development as a private venture in the interim years.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG-29K (Fulcrum-D)", "aircraft_type": "Carrier-Based Multi-Role Fighter"}, {"id": "2b571485-2e2d-4b84-8356-69e4ab110b8c", "year_model": "2009", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mil Mi-28 (NATO reporting name of \"Havoc\") was a product of the Cold War designed as an anti-tank attack platform similar in scope and function to the American Hughes AH-64 Apache series. As in the Apache, the Mi-28 featured an armored tandem-seat, stepped cockpit for a pilot and weapons officer, a chin-mounted turreted cannon and wingstubs along the fuselage sides for various munitions options - rockets and anti-tank missiles.\n\r\nThe Mi-28 system was on the drawing boards by early 1980 and flew in head-to-head competition trials with the Kamov-inspired single-seat, twin-rotor Ka-50 design. Though the eventual loser in the trials, the Mi-28 was still accepted for continued development and entered serial production in 1987 as the \"Mi-28A\" - being formally debuted to the public in the Paris Air Show of 1989. Though production for the initial mark did not last long (primarily due to its daytime-only operational status), the system was evolved in the Mi-28N day-night attack system (identified by the addition of a radome over the main rotor mast). Development of this new breed was slow as priority was still handed to the Ka-50 series and defense budgets were terribly slashed after the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991. However, due to the fall of the Soviet Union, the much-limited Ka-50 series began giving ground to the multi-role qualities of the Mi-28 which eventually superseded the Ka-50 as the standard Russian attack helicopter in the post-Cold War world. The proved more adaptable to the ever-changing conditions of the modern battlefield of the time, were more conventional in their two-crew arrangement and were less expensive to produce in the numbers required. After the protracted development of the new day-night Mi-28N (\"Night Hunter\"), an official introduction to the inventory of the Russian Air Force service occurred on October 15th, 2009. The Mi-28 and Ka-50 have since been fielded side-by-side, interestingly both now representing the Russian standard attack helicopter. The Russian Army received their first Mi-28Ns in 2006 as a replacement for their aging Mi-24 Hinds in the dedicated attack role.\n\r\nThe Havoc features a distinct elongated nose design which houses the required electronics suite. The crew of two (pilot in rear with the gunner in front) sit in tandem in a fully-armored framed cockpit capable of handling small arms fire up to 14.5mm in nature. The pilot (rear) benefits from the use of an advanced helmet-mounted display. Interestingly, piloting controls are not made redundant in the aft cockpit in an effort to promote strict concentration from either crewmember in his respective cockpit. Power is derived from 2 x Klimov-brand turboshaft engines driving a five-blade main rotor and a four blade tail rotor (facing starboard) while generating 2,200 horsepower each. Interestingly enough, despite its classification of \"attack helicopter\", the Mi-28 Havoc features a three-person passenger compartment  just aft of the main cockpit (similar to the larger Cold War-era Mil Mi-24 \"Hind\" series helicopters). However, this compartment is intended moreso as a rescue feature for downed airmen than for the transporting armed combatants into battle. Base armament of the helicopter is a powered underslung 30mm Shipunov 2A42 Autocannon in a chin mounting while wingstubs provide four hardpoints for anti-tank missiles, rocket pods and gunpods as required. The Havoc can, therefore, engage soft and hard targets at ease. The undercarriage is fixed and consists of two main landing gear legs at front  and a tail wheel at the rear. Overall design includes the forward-set armored cockpit, engines fitted high amidships, a long-running empennage housing the tail rotor shaft and a vertical tail fin capping the end of the aircraft.\n\r\nRussia remains the primary operator of the Mi-28 Havoc series though an export version has been offered to several interested nations including North Korea (Mi-28NAe), Iraq and possibly India, Algeria and Venezuela. Though only some 52 or so Havocs are currently active in the Russian inventory (as of 2012), it is expected that, at delivery's end (perhaps in 2015), nearly 70 systems will be available to the Russian Air Force. To date, a dozen make up a training squadron while the remainder form three regiments.\n\r\nIndian interest in procuring 22 examples of the Mi-28N (with Western electronics) remains, though the Hughes AH-64 Apache series may well replace the interest due to the complex and expensive nature of the conversion process required.\n\r\nThe Russian-Iraq deal for 30 Mi-28N helicopters was officially secured and announced on October 9th, 2012. This make Iraq just one of three formal operators of the Mi-28, joining Russia and Kenya - the latter having ordered 16 examples.\n\r\nMil has unveiled an all-new dedicated trainer variant of its formidable Mi-28 as the Mi-28UB. The platform is intended for those crew who will ultimately pilot the Mi-28N variant. The Mi-28UB features redundant controls at both cockpits to spread workload between the two pilots (unlike the single-stick configuration of the original Mi-28 production model). The new variant will potentially open sale of the Mi-28 to interested customers now that a dedicated trainer is available (previously, Mi-28 students trained on Mi-24 \"Hinds\"). The Mi-28 is intended as the modern replacement for the Mi-24 - though the Mi-24 itself has been modernized for its large export base as the Mi-35.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-28 (Havoc)", "aircraft_type": "Dedicated Twin-Seat, Twin-Engine Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "1354ce2e-1a12-485d-aaa8-d28f46f07943", "year_model": "2008", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has proven itself in warfare and humanitarian actions actively across the last two decades.

For example, such a VTOL system can be used in counter-smuggling operations, environmental disasters, data collection or real-time information reporting.\n\r\nAustrian-based Schiebel, the concern behind the Camcopter S-100, was founded in 1951 in the field of electronics and branched out into military products during the 1980s, specifically developing battlefield mine detectors. Schiebel then tried its hand in the field of UAVs during the 1990s ultimately delivering their S-100 in 2005. The first S-100 customer became the United Arab Emirates but recent interest has been received from the German, Pakistani and French navies. S-100s are produced out of the Schiebel Wiener Neustadt facility south of Vienna.\n\r\nThe Camcopter S-100 exhibits an very interesting design appearance that sports a shapely \"tear-drop\" fuselage. The nose is well-formed and dominated by a large grill assembly along its top side and vent slits along its lower areas. The deep portion of the fuselage contains the powerplant while the underside of the fuselage houses the variable payload facilities. The empennage is essentially a short tail section capped by a dorsal and ventral vertical tail fin. The dorsal fin also features vertical tail planes in a \"T\" arrangement. The ventral tail fin doubles as a tail skid in a three-point stance when the S-100 is at rest. The undercarriage includes the tail skid as well as a pair of wheel-less forward main landing gear legs. The two-blade main rotor assembly sits low against the fuselage spine while the two-blade tail rotor (used to counter the inherent torque rotation caused by the main rotor blades) is set to the portside of the aircraft. S-100 construction includes use of composites with a reinforced internal structure for the rigors and abuse of the battlefield - even in maritime environments. Dimensionally, the S-100 presents a running length of 10 feet with a width of 4 feet and a height of 3.65 feet.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Schiebel Camcopter S-100", "aircraft_type": "Rotary-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle"}, {"id": "0f9f2ac4-65f2-4846-ae47-508658aa1aca", "year_model": "2005", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mil Mi-35 \"Hind\" became a major upgrade to the classic Soviet-era Mi-24 \"Hind\" assault gunships and transport series of heavy helicopters. When the Mi-24 received various system  upgrades, the Mi-24V model variant was born and from this came the Mi-35 which originally served as the export designation. The Mi-35 carries a multirole classification and retains the tandem, two-seat crew arrangement as well as passenger cabin of the original Mi-24 and weapons are still held externally underneath wingstubs as in the original. The system entered series production in 2005.\n\r\nCompared to the original Cold War player, the Mi-35 has been given upgraded avionics and navigation along with a digital glass cockpit for each crewmember. The helicopter is also outfitted with a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging device, and improved target sighting systems. Internally, the helicopter has received reinforcement of its structure for increased battlefield survivability. The five-bladed main rotor utilizes fiberglass construction and armament wingstubs have been shortened to help promote a thinner forward/rear profile. Additional work has been put into rough field and \"hot-and-high\" operational capability as well.\n\r\nThe changes added to the Mi-24 to become the Mi-35 have considerably modernized and broadened the Cold War product considerably. All-weather and day-night operational capabilities are considered strong as is over-water service allowing the Mi-35 to function in nearly any battlefield environment. Optional equipment includes the OPS-24N observation-sight system, upgraded Anti-Tank (AT) functionality, and support for non-Russian communications kits.\n\r\nBeyond the attack helicopter role, the Mi-24/Mi-35 is something of a unique combat helicopter in that it can ferry up to eight fully-equipped combat troops thanks to its cabin area set under the main rotor and engines. Additionally, this space can be used to ferry cargo loads up to 1,500 kilograms overall while a sling system allows for an additional 2,400 kilograms to be carried externally. Beyond these roles, the helicopter can also serve as a MEDEVAC platform for ferrying wounded and associated medical staff. Onboard survivability is improved through a modern Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), IR jammer, IR suppression system at the engine exhaust vents, cockpit and critical components armoring, and a chaff/flare dispenser.\n\r\nIts engine makeup is 2 x Klimov VK-2500 series turboshafts with reduced noise levels and maintenance requirements. The Mi-35 retains the Mi-24's fixed wheeled tricycle undercarriage. Maximum speed reaches 310 kmh with cruising near 260 kmh. Hovering ceiling is 3,150 meters with a maximum operational ceiling of 5,400 meters. Ferry ranges reach out to 1,000 kilometers with a combat radius of 460 kilometers.\n\r\nAs armament is at the heart of the Mi-35 system, the helicopter can boast an impressive dedicated or mixed array of weaponry. This includes up to eight Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) across the four presented underwing hardpoints. Rocket loads are either 80mm S-8 series or 122mm S-13 series munitions used alongside or in place of the missile armament. 23mm gun pods can also be carried under the wingstub assemblies while there is also a twin-barreled 23mm cannon mounted in the chin turret as standard.\n\r\nTo date, the Mi-35 has been taken on by the Russian Army as well as Azerbaijan, Iraq, and Brazil. Mi-35 represents the standard version based on the Mi-24V while the Mi-35 is an export night attack variant with improved sensors for low-light-level operation. The Mi-35M2 marks updated Mi-35Ms for service in the Venezuelan Army. Similarly, the Mi-35M4 is for the Brazilian Air Force though with Israeli avionics (as the AH-2 \"Sabre\"). The Mi-35O is a Mexican Army model with locally-developed FLIR system. The MI-35P is the export designation for the Mi-24P model which is closely related to the Mi-24VM and Mi-35M3 is used to designate export-minded Mi-24VMs. The MI-35U is an unarmed trainer variant of the combat-capable Mi-35.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-35 (Hind-E)", "aircraft_type": "All-Weather Heavy Assault Gunship / Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "c2bba536-bf26-4617-95a5-ed7ae7c80910", "year_model": "2005", "description": "\r\n        \tIn recent years, Russian defense forces have been adopting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in greater numbers. One type in having made its way into the inventory of the Russian Air Force is the compact Yakovlev \"Pchela\" (\"Bee\") which is used for the Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance (ISR) role. The system is used by the militaries of both Russia and North Korea (2018). A first-flight was recorded in 1990.\n\r\nThe vehicle's design consists of a tube-like fuselage which houses the optics and avionics set in the front and the powerpack in the rear. The optics are held in a traversing \"blister\" mounted in the chin position and integrates real-time video feeds with protected data-link capability - giving ground commanders access to real-time battlefield data. The engine drives a shrouded propeller unit in \"pusher\" configuration at the tail. Over midships is a shoulder-mounted, straight wing mainplane. The undercarriage is a static, shock-absorbing four-legged tube assembly.\n\r\nAs designed, the air vehicle has a an operational range out to about 40 miles from its ground remote-control post and can reach altitudes in excess of 8,000 feet. Maximum speed reaches over 110 mph. The system can remain airborne for some two total hours. The launch process requires use of two solid-propellant booster rocket-driven engines and recovery is by way of a parachute deployed to retard the fall of the vehicle as it returns to the ground. The vehicle is flown either through pre-set mission waypoints (automated flight) or by remote, manual input by a ground-based operator.\n\r\nBeyond its stated value to the ISR role, the Pchela can also be used to designate targets for accompanying attack aircraft and can further serve as a target drone for training actions. Like other UAVs of this class, the Pchela is designed with a modular payload-carrying capability which can be arranged to suit the needs of the customer.\n\r\nAccording to Yakovlev marketing materials, the complete Pchela field system includes up to ten air vehicles with associated (dispensable) booster launchers, the mobile GCS and launch rail (built into the compact tracked, air-droppable BTR-D armored vehicle), a supporting URAL-4320 military truck, and a loader-transporter GAZ-66 series military truck.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Pchela (Bee)", "aircraft_type": "ISR Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)"}, {"id": "6180b986-f515-4b33-8cdd-b67a86c23f72", "year_model": "2004", "description": "\r\n        \tThe DA42 \"Twin Star\" is a lightweight, twin-engined utility-minded VIP passenger hauler and flight trainer aircraft designed, developed and produced by Diamond Aircraft Industries of Austria. A first-flight in prototype form was recorded on December 9th, 2002 and the design entered formal service operations during 2004. It remains in production (since 2002) with over 600 units completed. The DA42 became the company's first entry into the multi-engine aircraft market and succeeded the single-engined DA40 model of 1997. European certification followed in April of 2004 and U.S. certification was granted in 2005.\n\r\nThe aircraft utilizes a robust, easy-to-maintain carbon composite airframe as well as sleek aerodynamics throughout for both a weight-savings measure and to promote air flow efficiency - resulting in higher performance for a product of this class. The nose section is flat and wide and the overall fuselage shaping incorporates noticeable tapering aft of the cabin section. The tail unit showcases extensions from the vertical rudder at both its ventral and dorsal lines offering greater surface area without much added drag. The tail unit is capped by split horizontal planes in a proven Multhopp T-style arrangement. The wing mainplanes are set low against the sides of the fuselage and have upturned \"winglets\" at their tips (another fuel efficiency measure). Each engine nacelle is tightly cowled, streamlined, and integrated into the lines of each wing mainplane. A typical tricycle wheeled undercarriage is utilized for ground-running (nose leg and two main legs, all retractable).\n\r\nIts Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) is 4,407lb while the Maximum Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW) is listed at 4,045lb. Standard empty weight is 3,109lb. Dimensions include a running length of 28.1 feet, a wingspan of 44.6 feet, and a height of 8.2 feet.\n\r\nThe cockpit takes a panoramic approach when providing the pilot and occupants with the best possible vision. Window spaces are large and elegantly curved for maximum viewing over the nose and wings of the airframe. Entry-exit into the aircraft is accomplished by a forward-hinged swinging canopy door and upward-opening large rear access panels. The cabin contains folding seats and luggage storage. There is additional storage to be found at the nose section as well. Cabin finishes can be customized to suit the customer and his/her clientele. The cockpit carries a Garmin G1000 series avionics fit with 3-axis GFC7000 Automated Flight Control System. There is seating for four (2x2) including the pilot (three passengers can be carried). In many respects, the DA42 is a \"luxury car for the sky\".\n\r\nInitial models were powered by Thielert TAE 125-01 \"Centurion\" diesel-fueled engines but financial issues with the engine-maker forced Diamond to select the Austro AR300 line for 2009 (DA42 production was actually suspended back in July 2008 because of the Thielert issue). As such, power to newer models is from 2 x Austro AE300 turbocharged jet-fueled piston engines driving three-bladed MT hydraulic constant speed, low noise propeller units in conventional puller fashion. A single throttle control lever operates power to both engine fits for added operator simplicity. Each unit is also digitally controlled with single-switch feathering as needed (FADEC arrangement). Fuel capacity reaches 79.4 USG. Performance specs include a maximum speed of 221 miles per hour, a range out to 1,052 miles, and a service ceiling up to 18,000 feet.

The series saw a first-flight recorded on February 19th, 2002 and official introduction occurred on March 17th, 2004 through LOT Polish Airlines. Since then, the E-Jet family of airliners has encountered relative success in a crowded narrow-body airliner market with over 1,400 examples produced since 2001 and over 140 more airframes currently (2018) on order.\n\r\nIts design is conventional as airliner \"twins\" go: the tubular fuselage makes up all of the aircraft's length. The pilots are seated aft of the downward sloping nosecone in a side-by-side arrangement with excellent forward visibility. The sides of the fuselage are lined with rounded windows for the passenger compartment. The wing mainplanes are seated low to either side of the fuselage and each carries an underslung turbofan engine nacelle. The empennage tapers to the rear and is capped by a single, high-reaching vertical fin and low-set, upward-canted horizontal planes. For ground-running, the aircraft has been given a traditional tricycle arrangement made up of two main legs and a nose leg.\n\r\nThere are four major variants in the E-Jet family line: the E170, E175, E190, and E195.\n\r\nThe E170 is also known as the EMB 170-100 and features seating for 60 to 78 passengers depending on configuration. Power is from 2 x GE CF34-8E turbofan engines of 14,200lb thrust each. Range is out to 4,000 kilometers. Dimensions include a length of 98 feet, a wingspan of 85.3 feet, and a height of 9.3 feet.\n\r\nThe E175 (EMB 175-200) is the follow-up, \"stretched\" to the E170 and seats between 64 and 88 passengers. The engines remain the same as the E170 (including thrust figures) but its overall length varies slightly with a value of 103.10 feet. Range is increased slightly out to 4,075 kilometers.\n\r\nThe E175SC is a relatively new addition to the E170 line-up. It was announced in late-2017 under the \"Special Configuration\" descriptor and is set to feature the seating arrangements available to the E170 model with utilization of the E175 airframe (and all the benefits of operating the stretched, longer-ranged fuselage).\n\r\nThe E190 (EMB 190-100) is another stretched variant but dimensionally larger when compared to the E170 and E175 models. Seating is for 88 to 114 passengers and power is from 2 x GE CF34-10E turbofan engines of 20,000lb thrust. Dimensions equal a length of 118.10 feet, a wingspan of 94.2 feet, and a height of 34.6 feet. Range is out to 4,540 kilometers.\n\r\nThe E195 (EMB 195-200) is the other stretched E190 form, seating between 88 and 124 passengers. The same engines as the E190 are in play but range is increased to 4,260 kilometers. Length is slightly increased as well to 126.9 feet while the E195 shares the wingspan of height of its E190 sister.\n\r\nThe business jet alternative to the civilian airliner of the E-Jet series is the \"Lineage 1000\". This model will sport seating for nineteen in the expected VIP trim. At least two production-quality airframes were ready as of 2008.\n\r\nOf the four major variants, the E190 has proven the definitive market form with 549 units delivered and 43 currently on order as of July 2018. The E175 is a close second with 511 airframes delivered and 92 currently on order. The E195 represents the smallest sales figures of the four with 164 aircraft delivered and five on order. The E170 has 190 airframes in active service with a single example on order.\n\r\nThe jets are used throughout the world across various civilian markets.\n\r\nThe E-Jet E2, detailed elsewhere on this site, is a further development of the E-Jet family series.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Embraer E-Jet", "aircraft_type": "Narrow-Body, Medium-Range, Twin-Engine Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "afc4a733-cd1d-4f54-9922-72caae4ae349", "year_model": "2003", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Beriev Be-200 \"Altair\" is based on the Cold War-era Beriev A-40 \"Albatros\", a twin-engined amphibious aircraft capable of landing and taking off from water or a runway. Two of the militarized version were procured by the Russian Navy during the 1980s. First flight of a multirole, civilian-variant occurred on September 24th, 1998 for use in firefighting, general cargo transport, passenger hauling, maritime patrol and Search And Rescue (SAR) services. To date, nine of the Be-200 have been manufactured under the Irkut brand label. The Be-200 is currently (February 2014) used by the Azerbaijani Ministry of Emergencies as well as the Russian Ministry of emergency Situations. It is under order for the Russian Ministry of Defence.\n\r\nThe true amphibious qualities of the Be-200 allow the aircraft to come to rest on water sources. As a firefighting platform, this facilitates the need to take on water stores and then return over a contested fire. In the same way, the aircraft is able to land on water to rescue downed airmen or civilians when otherwise a rescue helicopter would have to be called in.\n\r\nThe aircraft is crewed by two and can seat as many as 72 when outfitted in the passenger transport role. Her cargo-carrying capacity sits at 16,500lbs. Up to 26,450lbs of water volume can be taken on. Overall dimensions include a length of 105 feet, a wingspan of 107.6 feet and a height of 29 feet. Her design includes a boat-like fuselage doubling as a waterborne hull with the flight deck set at the extreme front end of the aircraft. Wings are purposely high-mounted along the sides of the fuselage to promote better lifting qualities. Pontoons are affixed to the outer edges of the wings, just short of each wingtip. The engines are also high-mounted to help clear water spray and consist of 2 x Progress D-436To turbofan installations rated at 16,535lbs of thrust each unit. The tail unit is a T-style arrangement with high-mounted horizontal planes set atop a single vertical tail fin. When at rest on land, a conventional three-legged, wheeled undercarriage is used.\n\r\nThe Be-200 features a maximum speed of 435 miles per hour with a cruise speed nearing 350 miles per hour. Range is out to 1,300 miles with a full ferry range of 2,000 miles.

The Be-200E is offered as a version with English instrumentation over the original Russian lettering (Be-200ES). Be-200RR is a proposed variant to be outfitted with Western-friendly Rolls-Royce engines to help broaden the type's marketing appeal outside of the Russian sphere of influence. The Be-210 is a proposed passenger airliner model. Similarly, the Be-220 is a proposed dedicated maritime patrol variant for over-water service.

The type is marketed as an airliner and sports a high-wing design giving it naturally strong lift properties and good short-field / rough-field operating capabilities. A first-flight, by way of prototype, was had on September 17th, 1997 and service introduction followed in 2002. Only about twenty aircraft are in active service (January 2017) with nearly that amount on order. Operators reside in Ukraine, Russia and Iran while production has been ongoing since 1997.\n\r\nThe An-140 competes with such types as the French ATR42, Canadian Bombardier \"Dash 8\" series, the German Dornier 328, and the Russian Ilyushin Il-114.\n\r\nAs designed, the An-140 features a crew of two and seating for up to fifty-two. The aircraft sports an overall length of 74.1 feet, a wingspan of 80.4 feet and a height of 27 feet. Empty weight is 28,240lb against an MTOW of 47,350lb. Power is from 2 x Klimov TV3-117VMA-SBM1 turboprop engines developing 2,466 horsepower each though an alternative fit is offered, one that is designed to make the An-140 a \"friendlier\" international player, by way of 2 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127A series turboprops of 2,500 horsepower (each).\n\r\nStated performance includes a maximum speed of 357 miles per hour, a cruise speed of 290 mph, a range out to 1,505 miles (ferry range of 2,300 miles) and a service ceiling of 25,000 feet.

The latter is a local, license-built Iranian variant manufactured from prepared Antonov kits. The aircraft are intended for maritime patrol and general freighter duties.\n\r\nThe An-140 product has seen its fair-share of disasters with crashes registered in December 2002, August 2005, December 2005, February 2009, and August 2014 under various operators. One locally-built Iranian An-140 crashed during a training flight (killing five) resulting in the fleet being grounded.\n\r\nThe future of An-140 aircraft in Russian service are in doubt since the Russian take-over of Ukranian Crimea in 2014.

The platform utilizes the Kamov signature co-axial main rotor arrangement, in which one multi-bladed main rotor is set atop another, which negates use of an anti-torque tail rotor unit. The rotors themselves carry an advanced blade design critical to efficiency and effectiveness. Under 100 units of this versatile helicopter have been completed to date (2018) with foreign market interest slowly growing.\n\r\nThe Ka-226 can trace its lineage to the earlier single-engined Ka-126 (17 built) of 1989 which, itself, was born from the much-earlier Cold War-era Ka-26 (816 built) of 1969. Work on the Ka-226 was begun around 1990 and intended to satisfy a Russian government need for a multi-role humanitarian relief platform.\n\r\nOn the whole, the Ka-226 shares a conventional design arrangement which sees the cockpit overlooking a short nose section, a centralized engine and passenger cabin, and a tail unit at the rear. The forward section of the aircraft relies on oversized panes for excellent vision out-of-the-cockpit.

Nevertheless, the service sought modernization and, among one of its many requirements, there stood a pressing need to upgrade its Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) force made up of an aging line of Czech-made Aero L-29 and L-39 aircraft (detailed elsewhere on this site). This led to a competition featuring the Yakovlev Yak-130 and the competing Mikoyan \"MiG-AT\". In the end, the Yak-130 was selected for the government contract, leaving just two flyable MiG-AT prototypes from the now-cancelled Mikoyan venture.\n\r\nBecause of the Russian financial situation, Yakovlev teamed with Italian defense powerhouse Leonardo while MiG-AT partnered with French aero-engine-maker SNECMA/Turbomeca. In the latter, the partnership was established in 1992 and it was agreed that the two flyable prototypes to be had would be fitted with 2 x Larzac turbofan engines for inherent power. Additionally, the French involvement opened the MiG-AT to the global export stage by providing a variant that could be marketed to Western powers complete with French-originated engines (SNECMA-Turbomeca Larzac 04R20 series) and Thales avionics (conversely Russian versions of this same aircraft would centered on Russian engines - Aviadvigatel (Soyuz) RD1700 turbofans - and avionics).\n\r\nMikoyan engineers elected for a highly-conventional design arrangement in their MiG-AT, with low-set straight wing mainplanes, twin-seat tandem cockpit (for student and instructor), and a traditional tailplane arrangement seating the horizontal plane at the rudder's midway point (an early design saw the horizontal plane seated atop the fin). The twin engine installation would be side-by-side in typical fashion and aspirated by small side-mounted fuselage intakes. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was used for ground-running.\n\r\nInternally, the aircraft featured composite construction. Controlling was aided by Fly-by-Wire (FbW) software and hardware, allowing the design to be inherently unstable. Additionally, the control scheme was designed to be customizable by the operator so that the aircraft could mimic the flight characteristics of various in-service Russian fighter jets for training. The cockpit would sport the usual systems such as a wide-angled Head-Up Display (HUD) and Hands-On-Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) - all set to mimic modern-day fighters. Mission support would be largely handled by large Multi-Function Displays (MFDs).\n\r\nWith ground-running trials underway in March of 1996, a first-flight of a MiG-AT prototype was formally had that month on March 21st. This form carried the French engines and Western avionics fit. The second followed with the full Russian configuration and was officially revealed in the latter part of 1997. It was publicly displayed at the international level at Paris Air Show 2001.\n\r\nVariants of the series went on to include the original MiG-AT twin-seat AJT. This was to be followed by  the MiG-AC, a proposed single-seat attacker completely modified for the combat role and featuring a shortened fuselage assembly. A hybrid offering was also to come online as the MiG-ATC. This version was to became a combination platform satisfying AJT and light attack through a singular platform and carry Helmet-Mounted Displays (HMDs) for the pilot and complete support for Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface missiles and drop ordnance. None of the variants saw the light of day.\n\r\nAt any rate, the MiG-AT lost out to the competing Yak-130 in a 2002 resolution. Mikoyan representatives attempted to keep their project afloat - indeed certification was granted in 2004 - by interesting foreign buyers in the type but these initiatives fell to naught. In June of 2018, rumors arose of a possible resurrection of the MiG-AT program but these have yet to be founded.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG-AT", "aircraft_type": "Advanced Jet Trainer / Light Attack"}, {"id": "e571b48e-1bd4-4f18-8bc6-04c1f7db4038", "year_model": "2001", "description": "Bombardier Aerospace - Canada", "aircraft_name": "Bombardier CRJ (Series)", "aircraft_type": "Twin-Engine Regional Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "5bbd3a38-8b58-439b-b6e5-42f8b1455bd7", "year_model": "1999", "description": "\r\n        \tMikoyan designed the MiG 1.42 in response to a Soviet requirement for a multi-role frontline fighter through the \"Multifunctional Frontline Fighter\" program begun sometime in the 1980s.

The 1.42 was selected as the eventually replacement to the successful Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" series in 1986. While the designation of \"1.42\" was used to signify the project itself as well as the main prototype(s),  the designation of \"1.44\" was used for to signify the program's aerodynamic test airframe of (which two are thought to have been produced). The two airframe types are differentiated by the 1.42's noted improved functions and represents the version most closely associated with a production-standard airframe. The 1.44 is essentially an aerodynamic demonstrator. In all, the 1.42 program appears as nothing more than a technology demonstrator for both the Mikoyan bureau and the Russian Air Force.\n\nNATO MiG 1.42/1.44 Nomenclature\n\r\nDespite the non-production status of the aircraft, NATO has assigned the two airframes respective codenames in its inventory nomenclature - these being \"Foxglove\" (for the 1.42) and \"Flatpack\" (for the 1.44). To further confuse things, the project aircraft are also known under the collective designation of \"MiG-MFI\". MFI stands for \"Mnogo-Funktsionalniy Istrebitel\" or \"Multi-Role Fighter\".\n\nMiG 1.42/1.44 Walk-Around\n\r\nThe MiG 1.42/1.44 was powered by a pair of thrust-vectoring Lyulka-Saturn AL-41F series afterburning turbofan engines delivering 39,680lbs of thrust each. Thrust-vectoring allows aircraft unprecedented agility in the skies, particularly in lateral movements. The twin powerplants were aspirated by a pair of under-fuselage intake openings similar in placement to that as found on the Eurofighter Typhoon. The fuselage maintained a generally pleasing, well-rounded appearance - a far cry from the boxy airframes consistent with the Soviet Cold War-era. The cockpit was held forward in the design, aft of a nose cone assembly to someday house an active phased radar array. The cockpit featured seating for one pilot under a two-piece canopy with relatively good views out of the seat. The pilot sat behind an \"all-glass\" instrument panel and the installed weapons system was said to be capable of targeting some twenty aerial targets at once. Of note is that the technology powering the 1.42/1.44 was essentially equivalent to that of 4.5-Generation fighter designs and this included its fly-by-wire configuration and general construction and layout. All-moving canard wings were affixed to the forward portion of the fuselage to aid in low-level/low-speed flight. The main wing assemblies were themselves large-area delta systems with noticeable sweep along the trailing edge. The delta design meant that there were no \"true\" horizontal tail planes found on conventional aircraft. Vertical fins were mounted outboard of each engine compartment at the rear, notable in that they were well-spaced apart. The engines themselves were tightly set in a side-by-side arrangement and exhausted through their respective vectoring nozzle rings. The undercarriage was of a conventional tricycle type featuring two main landing gear legs (single-wheeled) and a nose landing gear leg (double-tired). Stealth was said to feature prominently in the exterior design of the 1.42 but has been dismissed as an optimistic claim by Western observers.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG 1.42 / 1.44 / MFI", "aircraft_type": "Technology Demonstrator"}, {"id": "107b1d63-4b34-4a5c-8180-4233663fba88", "year_model": "1999", "description": "\r\n        \tAt one point in recent history, the Tu-334 stood as a new entry in the narrow-body jet airliner market for the storied Tupolev concern. Work began in the 1990s though the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 hindered development considerably. After the Russian aero-industry was nationalized in 2009, work on the Tu-334 was stopped and the project officially ended shortly thereafter. Two prototypes were built for the program that cost roughly over 4! billion USD.\n\r\nThe Tu-334 had its origins in the Tu-204 narrow-body of 1995 of which 82 were ultimately made. The Tu-334 was shorter and thicker in fuselage design and incorporated more efficiency measures - both in fuel and aerodynamics. The general arrangement was highly conventional with a two-person flight deck, centralized passenger section and low-mounted, swept-back wing mainplanes. The tail unit was of a T-style and the engines held outboard of the aft fuselage. The undercarriage was of a tricycle arrangement.\n\r\nA stripped-down prototype was unveiled in 1995 and a first-flight was not had until February 8th, 1999. Certification followed in December of 2003 and orders from seven carriers, both foreign and local, were locked in and there proved the potential for nearly 300 units going forward. Iran also worked to secure local, licensed production of the type. The Tu-334 performed at the MAKS airshow in Moscow in 2007.\n\r\nOf course all this came to naught with the cancellation of the long-gestating program in 2009. Russian industry instead moved to develop other similar competitors such as the Sukhoi SuperJet 100 (detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nThe Tu-334 was planned in several variants beginning with the standard Tu-334-100 which would have seated 72 passengers in a two-class configuration or 100 in a single-class configuration. This aircraft was slated to carry 2 x Progress D-436T1 turbofan engines outputting 16,500 lb of thrust each and cruise at speeds of 510 miles per hour and range out to 1,700 nautical miles. Overall length was 102.6 feet and wingspan was 97.7 feet with a height of 30.8 feet. Empty weight was 63,825lb against an MTOW of 105,600lb.\n\r\nThe Tu-334-100C was to serve as a combination passenger-cargo hauler and the Tu-334-120 was to be developed with 2 x Rolls-Royce BR715-55 turbofan engines. The Tu-334-100D was to receive a fuselage lengthening (up to 21 inches) as well as wider-spanning wings while being powered by 2 x Progress D-436T2 turbofan engines. The Tu-334-120D, based in the Tu-334-100D, would have switched to the BR715-55 engines from Rolls-Royce. The Tu-336 was a more experimental platform in that it was to be fueled by liquid natural gas and the Tu-354 (formerly the Tu-334-200) was to become another stretched option (150 inches) and feature seating for some 126 passengers. Engine options ranged between the aforementioned Progress and Rolls-Royce types.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-334", "aircraft_type": "Narrow-Body Passenger Airliner Prototype"}, {"id": "9c74a864-8453-4030-8196-967784a1710d", "year_model": "1998", "description": "Ilyushin OKB / Mikoyan (RSK MiG) - Russia", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-114", "aircraft_type": "Regional Turboprop Airliner / Military Aircraft"}, {"id": "7e47f384-13e6-4cd7-ae32-a94faa96e4e9", "year_model": "1997", "description": "\r\n        \tWhile the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991 stymied many-a-program in Russia, the Sukhoi concern proceeded with their Su-37/47 \"Berkut\" (\"Golden Eagle\") technology demonstrator. The aircraft borrowed much from the other Sukhoi product - the Su-27 \"Flanker\" - with the exception of its main wing assemblies which were cranked forward in an attempt to research agility at subsonic speeds, post-stall maneuverability, use of strong-yet-lightweight composites and advanced fly-by-wire systems in a modern-day, turbofan-powered airframe. Four working prototypes were eventually completed though no formal adoption was made by the Russian Air Force, leaving the Su-47 to the pages of aviation history. However, the data collected from the various Berkut test flights were used in development of the Su-35 (an advanced Su-27 model line) as well as Russia's first 5th Generation Fighter - the PAK-FA \"T-50\" - this development intended to compete with the American Lockheed F-22 \"Raptor\".\n\r\nThe use of forward-swept wing assemblies offers some inherent advantages to conventional, rear-swept appendages seen in nearly all jet-powered aircraft today. With such a configuration, the aircraft is capable of excellent maneuverability at subsonic speeds, reduced take-off and landing rolls, a reduced radar signature and increased control during high angles of attack. The primary detriment of the configuration remains the stress loads placed upon each wing, forcing them to twist and bend in an unnatural fashion, which can lead to midair disasters in the right circumstances. In the Su-37/47 design, the wings are purposely constructed of twisting/bending composites to alleviate such stresses.\n\r\nDuring World War 2, German engineers were able to successfully launch the jet-powered Junkers Ju 287 as a multi-engined bomber. This design was powered by 4 x Junkers Jumo 004 turbojets with two paired engines slung under each wing. The wings themselves were high-mounted and cranked forward along the fuselage sides. One working prototype was eventually completed and followed by two unfinished airframes before the end of the war. The examples were captured by advancing Soviet forces during the last weeks of the war and appropriately dissected by Soviet engineers. The concept of a forward-swept wing fighter was also entertained by the Americans during the Cold War years, embodied through the Grumman X-29 technology demonstrator. This aircraft first flew on December 14th, 1984 and utilized the fuselage of the Northrop F-5A \"Freedom Fighter\", two of which were converted into X-29 prototype form. Like the Berkut, the X-29 program reached its project end and was never adopted by the US military.\n\r\nThe Berkut herself was born during the waning years of the Soviet Empire when, in 1983, the Soviet Air Force began funding the forward-swept wing program with Sukhoi. The product was originally born as the S-32 before graduating to become the Su-37 and, finally, the Su-47. The program was first leaked in 1996 and understood by the West to be the acting prototype for a Russian 5th Generation Fighter - perhaps intended to match with the American F-22 which was also in development at the time. First flight of the S-32 was recorded on September 25th, 1997 and its first public display was noted at Zhukovsky in August of 1999. The aircraft achieved supersonic flight in August of 2000 and by this time it was understood that the S-32/Su-37 design was, in fact, only a true technology demonstrator and not a direct prototype to something forthcoming. The Su-37 was redesignated to Su-47 in 2002.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-32/37/47 Berkut (Golden Eagle)", "aircraft_type": "Technology Demonstrator Aircraft"}, {"id": "cecf360e-1c75-4cc5-9fc7-b69164b4e962", "year_model": "1996", "description": "\r\n        \tAirbus of France introduced their key A320 airliner product in 1988 by way of air carrier Air France and the family  has since grown the critical product line to include the short-hull A318, short-hull A319, and stretched A321 offshoots. All have been designed around the capability to reach short-to-medium ranged destinations through a twin-engine approach. The A319, the focus of this article, is designed as a short-hulled version of the base A320 and can haul up to 160 passengers in multi-class seating to ranges reaching 4,000 miles. The A319 series has become a commercially successful product for Airbus with nearly 1,500 examples built to date (mid-2018).\n\r\nVery little has changed in the A319 when comparing it to the original A320 beyond its shortened hull. The type was devised to counter the market grip of the Boeing 737-300 and 737-700 series jets. This involved a reduction in overall length by removal of seven sections of hull - thereby reducing length by just over 12 feet. The powerplant of choice became 2 x CFM56-5A or V2500-A5 series turbofan engines. The result is an aircraft which retained the exceptional passenger- and cargo-hauling qualities of the A320 though now with added range.\n\r\nThe finalized aircraft was rolled out in August of 1995 and a first-flight was recorded on August 25th of that year. Certification was granted in April of the following year. SwissAir was the launch customer in April of 1996.\n\r\nAs designed, the A319 carries a flight crew of two (not counting support staff) and can seat between 150 and 160 passengers depending on seating and class arrangement (one or two classes). Overall length is 111 feet with a wingspan of 117.4 feet and a height of 38.6 feet. Empty weight is 90,000lb against a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 166,000lb. \n\r\nPower is from 2 x CFM International CFM56 or IAE V2500 series turbofan engines providing between 22,000lb and 27,000lb of thrust each unit. These are mounted in nacelles found under each wing mainplane. Maximum speed is 540 miles per hour with cruising closer to 515mph. Range with a standard loadout is 3,750 miles (it is capable of crossing each ocean on both of America's coasts). Its service ceiling can reach 41,000 feet.\n\r\nThe A319 sub-family of jets consists of several variants all its own (that is, apart from the A320 line). This includes the A319CJ (now ACJ319) corporate-minded hauler with seating for thirty-nine, the A319neo (New Engine Option) modernization product (offering CFM International or Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines), the proposed A319 MPA (Maritime Patrol Aircraft) over-water military platform (intended to compete with the Boeing P-8 \"Poseidon\"), and the A319LR (Long-Range) extended range model.\n\r\nDeliveries of the A319 have tapered off considerably since they began in 1996 (eighteen were delivered that year compared to just two in 2018). Peak deliveries occurred in 2005 with 142 finding homes with various air carriers and, the following year, a further 137 were brought online. At least thirty A319neo models are on order though this variant in the \"neo\" line have now seen the market interest that the A320 and A321 have casting some doubt as to its future.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Airbus A319", "aircraft_type": "Narrow-Body, Short-to-Medium Route Passenger Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "734b6253-786b-4e73-bb87-f15dc3302d1e", "year_model": "1996", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-30 was initially developed as a further modification to the existing Su-27 \"Flanker\" series but ended as its own, all-new mark. The aircraft encompasses a multi-mission design frame based on the Su-27 though incorporated a second crewman (seated in tandem), improved datalinking and increased operational endurance. Production of this series model began in 1992 and is ongoing as of this writing (2017). Some 540 have been produced to date with operators (beyond Russia) now including Algeria, Angola, China, Belarus, India, Indonesia, Kazahkstan, Malaysia, Uganda, Venezuela and Vietnam - making this combat platform an important product in the Sukhoi fighter lineup.\n\r\nThe Su-27 family of large fighters makes up the backbone of the Russian Air Force and Navy Aviation fleets. It has proven itself to be a highly versatile, high performance combat platform that has wowed generations of onlookers at air shows and proven popular with former Soviet states and allies worldwide. Developments like the Su-30, Su-34 and Su-35 only serve to keep the line strong and the product a viable instrument over the modern battlefield.\n\r\nFrom development beginning in 1986, a first-flight in prototype form (based on the two-seat Su-27PU interceptor) was recorded on December 31st, 1989. However it was not until 1996 that the product was formally introduced into service for 1991 saw the formal end of the Soviet Empire of the Cold War (1947-1991).\n\r\nAt its core, the Su-30 represents a powerful evolution of the original Su-27 Flanker. It improves on the original's operational range and carries with it a refined air-to-air / air-to-surface all-weather attack quality. In this way, the same platform can be used to undertake both air space denial and ground strike missions as needed as it has a broadened support for various munitions types and its onboard systems can support both air and ground attacks. The general form and function of the Su-27 are retained but the mission set of the Su-30 is expanded considerably.\n\r\nPower is from 2 x Saturn AL-31F turbofan engines set within the lower body of the aircraft. These are fed through side-mounted intakes and exhausted at the rear as normal. Additionally the engines offer a reheat capability, better known as afterburner, which allows for short bursts of power and, therefore, short bursts of speed. The aircraft is capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.0 (1,300+ mph) out to a range (on internal fuel) of 1,850 miles. Its service ceiling is 56,800 feet and rate-of-climb is 56,800 feet-per-minute. Because of an integral refueling probe, the aircraft can expand its patrol range / mission endurance window up to 10 hours. Certain hardpoints under the aircraft are also plumbed for jettisonable fuel tanks. The second crewmember also alleviates crew fatigue on longer sorties.\n\r\nThe Su-30 carries the standard 30mm GSh-301 series automatic cannon and 150 projectiles are afforded it. Externally there are no fewer than twelve hardpoints and these support the full gamut of Russian munitions included air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles (including anti-ship and anti-radiation), rocket pods, general purpose conventional drop bombs and precision laser-guided bombs. The OEPS-27 forms the electro-optical targeting system of the aircraft. The nose houses a long-ranged phased-array Bars planar radar system.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-30 (Flanker-C)", "aircraft_type": "Two-Seat, Twin-Engine Air Superiority / Strike Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "290e920a-5486-479f-b4e8-051678835821", "year_model": "1995", "description": "\r\n        \tThroughout the 1970s, the Boeing Company operated the mammoth 747 four-engined, \"wide-body\" long-range jet airliner. In 1978, a move was enacted to supplement the 747 with the \"narrow-body\" 757 series, the wide-body 767 series and the Trijet 777, a triple-engine aircraft - a design proving popular at the time. The 757 and 767 both excelled in their operational service lives while the Trijet 777 fell out of favor. In an effort to fill the void left by the Trijet 777, the company moved on a new endeavor which saw it modify its existing 767 design. When potential carriers appeared lukewarm to the 767 modifications (designated as \"767-X\"), Boeing ordered an all-new design which would evolve to become the twin-engine, wide-body 777 family line. The Boeing 777 was developed completely from computer-aided designs, marking it as the first commercial aircraft to be devised as such. It also became Boeing's first \"fly-by-wire\" digitally-assisted airliner in the history of the company. In addition, feedback was taken from eight major carriers to include \"power players\" American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Delta, Japan Airlines, Qantas, United Airlines and All Nippon Airways. \n\r\nDespite the involvement of so many companies, the 777 went on to become a commercial success for Boeing. Production of the series was underway in 1993 with a first flight recorded on June 12th, 1994. The first 777 customer became United Airlines in October of 1990. Formal entry into service occurred with United Airlines on May 15th, 1995 with official introduction coming on June 7th. The first commercial flight was recorded on June 7th, 1995 from London to Washington, D.C.  Production has since surpassed 1,360 units and is still ongoing as of this writing (2012). Dispatch reliability (noted as high as 99.3%) and economical qualities have proven a major selling point with carriers concerning the 777 family. All passenger-minded versions of the aircraft can be arranged in the typical \"three-class\" seating configuration as needed and offer amenities consistent with expanding technologies such as personal power ports, in-flight entertainment as well as the latest in on-demand features. Since June of 1995, the 777 family line of aircraft has completed 5 million flights totaling 18 million hours of flight time. The 777 series set a world air distance record for non-stop travel by a commercial jet-powered aircraft when it completed a 11,664nm journey from Hong Kong to London over November 9th to the 10th in 2005. The journey spanned nearly 23 hours.\n\r\nDesign of the Boeing 777 model series is typical of passenger jet airliners to date. The type is characterized by its tubular fuselage which contains the passenger/cargo hold as well as the cockpit. The cockpit is situated at the extreme front end of the aircraft with six window panels offering excellent views out of the cockpit. The aircraft is primarily crewed by two pilots, each situated behind an all-glass cockpit with windowed views over the nose. This crew is supplemented by cabin crew in passenger airliner models as needed. The aircraft makes use of a low-set monoplane wing arrangement held at amidships and these installations sport noticeable sweep along the their leading edge. The trailing edges feature a straight section at the wing root which then sweeps back when tapering to the wing tip. Three strakes are noted along each wing underside as are speed flaps and ailerons, the latter held well outboard. Each wing also supports an engine nacelle, these engine fittings being some of the largest in commercial use today - the engine intake can easily fit a standing man, showcasing just how massive these installations truly are. In addition to the engines, the wings also house the large main landing gear legs, each showcasing six tires - an identifying feature of the series. The nose landing gear leg is of a typical dual-wheel configuration and is located under and aft of the cockpit floor. The empennage of the aircraft is conventional, with a single vertical tail fin clipped at its tip and a pair of horizontal tailplanes, also clipped at the tips. The tailplanes are set along the extreme aft portion of the fuselage sides with the fuselage then tapering into a \"blade-type\" cap at the extreme end. Overall, the 777 is composed of 3 million individual parts provided by some 500 global contractors making for one complex piece of aerial machinery.\n\r\nFlight control for the 777 series in handled by a full digital \"fly-by-wire\" system, technology once belonging solely to high-end military fighter aircraft. In this system, electrical signals are sent from the pilot controls (column, foot pedals, etc...) to a central processing computer which then dictates to the various control surfaces of the aircraft as needed. This negates the use of cables and applicable wiring to achieve the same result, thusly simplifying construction and actuation. The cockpit consists of five large, full-color liquid crystal displays (LCDs) that relay pertinent flight information to both pilots. The pilots are seated in a side-by-side arrangement with equal access to all controls. The throttle is managed from a center console separating the two seats. This console forces the pilots to climb up and over when entering or exiting their respective seats. Additional controls are located ahead and above each seat position. Views from each seat are elevated, providing for a commanding view of the area ahead, to the sides and to each engine as needed. The six windowed panels converge at centerline and are heavily framed.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Boeing 777 (Triple Seven)", "aircraft_type": "Wide-Body Passenger / Cargo Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "ae690891-9866-4e79-832f-ed70927ce4e1", "year_model": "1995", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kamov Ka-31 \"Helix\" series of medium-lift navalized helicopters was born out of a Soviet Navy need for an interim Airborne Early Warning platform while resources went to the proposed dedicated Antonov An-71 \"Madcap\". The An-71 would have operated directly from the flight decks of the limited Soviet carrier force but was cancelled when interest fell to the Yakovlev Yak-44 solution. The Yak-44 itself would have been another fixed-wing design launching from Soviet carriers but the fall of the Soviet Empire led to a cancellation in its development. Three An-71 prototypes were completed while only a full-scale mockup of the Yak-44 ever saw the light of day. This upheaval then paved the way for a modified form of the trusted-and-true Kamov Ka-27 \"Helix\" shipborne, twin-rotor, anti-submarine helicopter series known as the \"Ka-29\". Design work began in 1980.\n\r\nThe Ka-29 airframe was fitted with the same radar system which would have been fielded in the abandoned An-71 design. This new Helix prototype was then designated as the Ka-29RLD. The fuselage was widened but still retained the very identifiably stout Helix family form including its contra-rotating, stacked main rotor assemblies. The four-point undercarriage was retractable when the radar was utilized in an effort to keep the assemblies from interfering with the system (four single-wheeled main landing gear legs, two forward, two aft). The E-801E \"Oko\" radar system was fitted under the fuselage and laid flat against it when in transport, lowered only when actively used, which, in turn, prompted the landing gear to be raised. The Oko system could track targets as small as a conventional fighter up to 150 kilometers away in day or night. GPS and a semi-digital cockpit were made standard and the dual engine arrangement was improved to the Klimov-brand TV3-117VMAR powerplant series. Sensors and communications were also all bettered in the resulting end product. The system then underwent a period of lengthy trials and evaluation until the helicopter was cleared for flying. First flight was recorded in 1987 and the type was officially recognized by the West in 1988 when a pair were seen operating on the deck of the Tbilsi.\n\r\nThe Ka-31 languished during the lean years resulting from the Soviet fall. However, as the situation began to stabilized somewhat in the 1990s, serial production of the Ka-31 was underway - albeit in limited quantities. It was not until 1995 that the Ka-31 was officially entered into the now-Russian Navy inventory. As time wore on, the Ka-31 went on to see upgrades to its various systems to keep it a viable platform of the modern battlefield. Approximately 35 to 40 of the type have since been built to date.\n\r\nThe Ka-31 is crewed by three standard operating personnel including a pilot and co-pilot as well as up to three mission specialists. The cockpit is naturally set at the front of the fuselage and dotted with an array of windscreens for excellent vision out of the cockpit. Entry and exit for the pilots is accomplished by way of hinged automobile-style doors to the forward fuselage sides. The crew cabin area is set just aft of the cockpit. The aircraft is powered by a pair of Klimov (Isotov) TV3-117VMAR turboshaft engines, each delivering 1,217 horsepower to two, 3-bladed main rotor blades. The engines are set along the fuselage roof in a side-by-side arrangement. The use of contra-rotating blades means that the Ka-31 does not rely on a conventional tail rotor to counter the inherent torque of a spinning main rotor blade system. The tail is, instead, made up of a pair of large-area vertical tail fins consistent with previous Kamov helicopter offerings to date. A top speed of 166 miles per hour is reported as is a cruise speed of approximately 126 miles per hour. Range is 324 nautical miles with a service ceiling just under 11,500 feet. As a navy-minded mount, the Ka-31 skin and critical parts are designed to resist corrosion consistent with operations over salty seas.\n\r\nThe Ka-31 has seen only limited foreign export sales, this to the Indian Navy as well as to the Chinese Navy. India operates at least one aircraft carrier to date while China is in the process of trialing one (ex-Soviet) and constructing several more as of this writing. The Chinese Navy is believed to have received their first Ka-31s in November of 2010. The Ka-31 remains in operation service for all its listed users as of this writing.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kamov Ka-31 (Helix)", "aircraft_type": "Airborne Early Warning (AEW) Naval Helicopter"}, {"id": "25fe4bed-8812-4622-943d-b721357d8a53", "year_model": "1995", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kamov Ka-50 Chernaya Akula (or \"Black Shark\" and Codenamed \"Hokum\" by NATO) series of attack helicopter was developed in the latter years of the Cold War and did not enter operational service with Russian military forces until 1995. It features many interesting and unique design elements for a weapon of this classification and - at least on paper - would seem to give all other modern attack helicopters and ground armor units a run for their money thanks to the inherent capabilities in the distinct design. The need for a new Russian attack helicopter was developed after hard-earned lessons in the Soviet-Afghanistan Conflict\n\r\nDevelopment of the Ka-50 began in 1977, producing the V-80 prototype. The V-80 went airborne on July 27th, 1982 and evolved to become the V-80Sh-1 pre-production model. The Ka-50 squared off against the Mil Mi-28 \"Havoc\" - a conventional two-seat attack helicopter in competitive trials and was selected ahead of the Mil product in 1986. Funding delayed production for a time and renewed trials in 1994 did the Ka-50 project no better - 2000 saw the Mi-28 also selected for service. The Ka-50 became operational in 1995 and was produced through approximately 32 examples. Comparatively, the Mi-28 was introduced into service in 1996 and initially saw limited production for the Russian Air Force while Kenya entered the fray as an export customer (the Iraqi Air Force may become its next foreign operator of note).\n\r\nSince both attack types have been formally selected for quantitative procurement, Russian doctrine has evolved to include both platforms in future plans. The Ka-50/Ka-52, therefore, will be focused more on policing frontier territories of the vast Russian front while the Mi-28 will be utilized in the territories west of the Ural mountain range.\n\nBlack Shark Walk-Around\n\r\nFrom a design standpoint, the Ka-50 is very unconventional. The cockpit is situated forward in the fuselage with the engines just aft and t either side of the cockpit. Wings are fitted just under these powerplants and sport four hardpoints for a variety of ordnance options. Wingtip bulges are visible and field the aircraft's defensive anti-missile suite in the form of chaff and flare dispensers. Armor is such that all major components, systems and pilot are protected from weapon calibers ranging up to 20mm and 23mm. IR-suppressed exhausts and self-sealing fuel tanks assist the Black Shark in surviving the modern battlefield, important to consider when this type of aircraft is required to operate at low altitudes in hot zones. Engines are fitted high against the fuselage in an effort to keep the helicopter's critical powerplant system as far away from enemy ground fire as possible. The undercarriage - consisting of a tricycle-wheeled landing gear system - is fully retractable and promotes a \"low to the ground\" appearance when the helicopter is at rest. Construction of the Ka-50 involves more than 35% composite materials.\n\r\nThe most distinct feature of the Kamov Ka-50 is something of a Kamov-brand identifier - the twin contra-rotating co-axial main rotors. In this type of arrangement, the Ka-50 negates the need to balance the inherent power of the main rotor with a tail rotor unit common on most any other helicopter. In the Black Shark's case, the pair of counter-rotating main rotors (that is, each main rotor spins in the opposite direction of one another) balance the torque affect of one another out making for a stable and relatively responsive platform. It is a much noted fact that the loss of a tail rotor assembly to any modern helicopter more often than not spells certain doom for the system and crew alike. The Ka-50 makes use its main rotor assemblies to negate the possibility that the Black Shark can be lost through a direct hit on its tail section. As a result, combat survivability is greatly increased though at the expense of a more complicated set up. \n\r\nIn addition to combat factors, the deletion of the tail rotor assembly has a direct increase to the overall top speed, making it one of the fastest - if not THE fastest - attack helicopters in service. With power derived from the twin Klimov TV3-117VK turboshaft engines of 2,226 horsepower each, none of this output needs to be diverted to a tail rotor assembly and can instead be optimized to the centrally-located twin main rotors instead. Performance specifications include a top speed of 242 miles per hour (168 cruise speed), a range of 720 miles, a service ceiling of up to 18,000 feet and a rate-of-climb nearing 1,870 feet per minute.\n\r\nAnother noticeable design element present in the Ka-50 is the use of a single crewmember to command all of the available systems of the Black Shark. Though most contemporary attack helicopters utilize a dedicated pilot and gunner to split the tasks as related to combat, the Ka-50 provides the pilot a full suite of automated systems to keep the bird aloft and actively hunting. With attention given to this unique facet of the Black Shark's design, it remains to be seen whether the arrangement is actually a viable one considering the amount of instruments and systems the pilot must monitor and react to on any given sortie - particularly under intense combat conditions. In any case, the limitation of a single crewmember means the design also saves on weight that can be allocated to more vital components of the Ka-50 including armor and weapons.\n\r\nBattlefield survivability of the Ka-50 is given another major boost in the way of an ejection system in the K-37 ejection seat. Though quite uncommon in attack helicopters of today, the Black Shark features a complicated but life-saving process that can potentially save the pilots life. The system ejection process begins by having the twin main rotors ejected via controlled explosives followed by the ejection of the pilot a short moment later. This in itself sets the Black Shark apart from any other attack helicopter in this category and adds another thoughtful element to the survival design philosophy.\n\nWeapons Suite\n\r\nAs with any attack helicopter, armament is the true heart of the design. Available munitions include the latest in Russian anti-tank air-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft air-to-air missiles mounted on four external hardpoints on port and starboard wingstubs. The main weapon of the Ka-50 in the anti-tank hunting role is the tube-launched AT-16 Vikhr-M laser-guided air-to-surface anti-tank missile system. The missile has an operational range of up nearly five miles, offers armor penetration and can reach speeds of Mach 1.8. The Ka-50, and its two-seat variant, the Ka-52, as well as the Su-25T \"Frogfoot\" are all cleared for using the missile system. Additionally, the Ka-50 is slated to carry traditional gunship weaponry including munition-dispensing rocket pods featuring various warhead types. The Black Shark can also carry external fuel pods for increased range, gun pods and drop bombs as required. \r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kamov Ka-50 Black Shark (Hokum)", "aircraft_type": "Dedicated Single-Seat Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "dcd81ec9-b4f7-4225-a3ad-2ba61f66a4f7", "year_model": "1995", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tu-204 is a narrow-body, twin-engine passenger airliner developed by Tupolev OKB of Russia at the tail-end of the Soviet Empire's reign and introduced in the period thereafter with air carrier Aeroflot. The type has mainly proven popular with former Soviet-aligned nations including China, Cuba, Egypt, and North Korea who have purchased the series in limited numbers when compared to Western counterparts of same class and role. Fewer than 100 airframes have been delivered despite a series introduction had in 1996 and no one year has resulted in more than ten airframes being completed.\n\r\nIts prototype flew for the first time on January 2nd, 1989, some thirty-plus years ago. The aircraft is broadly comparable to the American Boeing Model 757 twin-engined airliner detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the Tu-204 aircraft is conventional: the cockpit/flight deck is positioned over and aft the short nosecone assembly. The fuselage is tubular and lined with oval vision ports while the tail incorporates a single rudder fin with low-mounted, all-moving horizontal planes. The mainplanes are low-mounted along the fuselage sides, swept-back for aerodynamic efficiency, and positioned near midships. Each member supports a single nacelle engine component which is slung under the wings. More modern incarnations of the aircraft also sport winglets for added stability and enhanced fuel economy. A retractable tricycle undercarriage is used for ground-running and is made up of double-bogied main legs and a single-bogied nose leg.\n\r\nInternally, the typical cabin arrangement is of single-aisle with three seats to a fuselage side. As a multi-role airframe, however, the internals can be completely reworked to accept cargo loads for long-haul transport sorties. In the cockpit, the flight crew sits side-by-side with control columns and rudder pedals duplicated as expected. The throttle quadrant is on a shared center console and various controls are positioned in an overhead set up. More modern variants of the line naturally have more modern cockpits complete with color displays and a more minimal instrument panel arrangement as a whole.\n\r\nThe original production airliner was the \"Tu-204\" and the freighter version became the \"Tu-204C\" (to include the \"Tu-240-100C\" and the \"Tu-240-120C\" marks). The \"Tu-204-100\" of 1995 switched to the (Aviadvigatel) PS90 turbofan engine of 35,300lb thrust. Its longer-ranged counterpart became the \"Tu-204-200\". Today, the mark is produced under the \"Tu-214\" designation.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-204-120\", \"Tu-204-220\", \"Tu-204-120C\", and \"Tu-204-220C\" have all been offered with foreign avionics and engine fits in an effort to expand the product line in Western-leaning markets.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-204-300\" (\"Tu-234\") was given a shortened fuselage with enhanced operational ranges. The \"Tu-204-500\" is a dedicated short-ranged hauler that's faster with smaller-area mainplanes.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-204SM\" (\"Tu-204CM\") fulfills the medium-haul market requirement and is formed from the earlier Tu-204-100/300 series.\n\r\nThe \"Tu-206\" is a proposed private-venture testbed.\n\r\nThe related, heavier, and longer-ranged \"Tu-214\" was born from the Tu-204-200 and is manufactured outside of Tupolev facilities, primarily with Aviastar-SP and Kazan Aircraft Production Association. Various sub-marks of this model have been produced including special-mission governmental and military types.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-204", "aircraft_type": "Narrow-Body Passenger Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "feb496ad-fca5-4be2-85c5-5ad755f9b5ea", "year_model": "1994", "description": "\r\n        \tThe passenger airliner market is lucrative business and typically involves two industry heavyweights - Boeing and Airbus. Airbus' first entry ever became their successful A300 line which eventually produced offshoots in the A320, A330, and A340 models. The A330 joined the Airbus stable during the 1990s as a wide-body, twin-engine passenger hauler/freight mover and was formally introduced on January 17th, 1994 with launch customer Air Inter. Since then, the model has seen orders reach over 1,350 aircraft with over 1,100 having been fulfilled to date (2015). Production has been ongoing since 1992 and now includes three major variants - the A330-200, the A330-200F (\"Freight\"), and the A330-300. The A330 follows the A320 and A340 by bringing along with it industry staples such as Fly-By-Wire (FBW) controlling and glass cockpits for the crew of two. First flight of an A330 was on November 2nd, 1992 and the product competes directly with the 767, 777, and 787 models offered by rival Boeing.\n\r\nThe A330-200 is offered in two primary seat configurations, a 2-class seating 293 and a 3-class seating 253. The A330-200F, a cargo hauler by design, features seating for just twelve as the rest of its internal space is reserved for freight. The A330-300 has a 2-class arrangement seating 335 and a 3-class arrangement seating 295. The A330-200 and A300-200F models share an overall length of 193 feet while the A330-300 is increased to 209 feet. All share the same 197.9 foot wingspan. The aircraft is offered with three possible engines - 2 x General Electric CF6-80E1 turbofans of 72,000lbf thrust, 2 x Pratt & Whitney PW4000 turbofans of 70,000lbf thrust, or 2 x Rolls-Royce Trent 700 turbofans of 71,000lbf thrust - to help broaden the product's market appeal. Performance numbers include a maximum speed of 915 kmh, a cruising speed of 870 kmh, a range out to 13,400 kilometers, and a service ceiling of 42,650 feet. The A330-200F-model sees range reduced to 6,000 kilometers while the A330-300 follows with a 11,300 kilometer overall range.\n\r\nAirbus A330 series aircraft operators range from Argentina and Algeria to Ukraine and Yemen. Its largest supporter remains Air China with nearly fifty of the type making up its stock. The A330 line also makes up the A330 MRTT (\"Multi-Role Tanker Transport\"), a combination airframe used by several militaries for aerial refueling missions as well as general transport sorties. The A330 also served as the basis for the now-abandoned Airbus submission to the USAF's tanker program (\"KC-X\") - as the \"KC-45\" (detailed elsewhere on this site). The product was represented in the United States under a joint Northrop Grumman/EADS endeavor and was initially selected for adoption. The submission lost out to the Boeing KC-46 \"Pegasus\" (detailed elsewhere on this site) after a protested selection process.\n\r\nThe \"oversized parts\" handler, the A300-600St \"Beluga\" - will see its replacement formed from the existing A330 airframe.\n\r\nAs with any other passenger hauler, the A330 series has seen its share of accidents and fatalities. At least nineteen major events involving the line have been recorded with some 339 total lives lost.\n\r\nThe A330neo is in development to succeed the standard A330 product (and compete directly with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner line). This mark features solely Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines (2x), an increased wingspan, winglets for efficiency and other refinements. A first flight is expected to be undertaken in the middle of 2016 with formal model introduction to come during the latter half of 2017.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Airbus A330", "aircraft_type": "Wide Body Passenger Jet Airliner"}, {"id": "44f18a72-c7e1-4461-988c-554b57e055ac", "year_model": "1994", "description": "\r\n        \tSwiss-based Pilatus Aircraft Limited is a long-time player in the world of aerospace, having set up shop as far back as 1939. Fast-forward to 1994, the concern introduced a new single-engine passenger-and-cargo-minded utility aircraft in the Pilatus PC-12. A first-flight of a prototype form was recorded on May 31st, 1991 and the design went into production that same year. Before the end of 2017, total production of the series reached 1,500 units with many committed to the civilian market - though some have been outfitted by military services to undertake special missions roles.\n\r\nThe United States Air Force currently (2018) makes use of the PC-12 series as the \"U-28A\".\n\nPC-12 Variants\r\nVariants in the family line include the original PC-12/41 with its PWC PT6A-67B engine. These were followed by the PC-12/45 of 1996 which increased MTOW from 9,040lb to 9,920lb. In 2005, the company was granted certification for the next iteration of the series, the PC-12/47. Design changes led to another increase in MTOW to 10,450lb. The PC-12M \"Spectre\" became a special missions aircraft used by military services.\n\nPilatus PC-12NG\r\nThe PC-12/47E then followed in 2008 and this model shifted to the PWC PT6A-67P turboprop engine. The mark is also known as the PC-12NG (\"Next Generation\"). This model sports seating for two crew and up to nine passengers depending on the internal make-up of the cabin. Overall length is 47.2 feet with a wingspan of 53.3 feet and a height of 14 feet. MTOW is 10,450lb. The avionics fit it the Honeywell Primus Apex series suite.\n\nPC-12 Walk-Around\r\nThe PC-12 operates with a single turboprop engine installed at the nose - the globally popular 1 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67. This is used to drive a five-bladed Hartzell composite propeller. The aircraft can cruise at speeds nearing 330 miles per hour with a range out to 1,845 nautical miles and a service ceiling of 30,000 feet. Rate-of-climb is 1,920 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe basic arrangement of the aircraft is traditional. It has straight, low-mounted monoplane wing assemblies fitted ahead of midships and a single vertical tail fin. The tail fin supports a high-mounted horizontal plane. The undercarriage is of the typical tricycle arrangement. The cockpit is situated just aft of the engine compartment at the nose, offering good views for the two crew. An entry-exit door for passengers and crew is fitted to the portside near the cockpit. A cargo door is found along the same side of the fuselage just aft of the mainplanes.\n\r\nWith millions of flight hours recorded by the series, the PC-12 has enjoyed a stellar market run with the 1,000th airframe announced as delivered in June of 2010.

This aircraft was itself born in the 1970s and achieved a first-flight in January of 1983 with service introduction forthcoming the following year. The design proved a relative commercial success as some 459 examples were completed (the line still in active service). From this framework, a stretched version was developed that could carry more passengers yet still retain the high performance capabilities of the Model 340 over short-to-medium regional routes. The Model 2000 project was launched in 1989 and ultimately included component suppliers in Britain, Finland, and Spain. Out of the gate, Saab was able to secure forty-six total aircraft confirmed with an optional one-hundred forty-seven possible through future orders by customers.\n\r\nAs designed, the Model 2000 has an operating crew of two with a passenger-hauling capacity between 50 and 58 persons. The avionics fit is a Rockwell Collins ProLine 4 series suite with Integrated Avionics Processor (IAP) capability. The cockpit features side-by-side seating for the two crewmen and the forward instrument panel is dominated by large, full-color displays. Structurally, the aircraft has an overall length reaches 89.5 feet with a wingspan measuring 81.2 feet and a height of 25.3 feet.

The Su-33 initially existed as the Su-27K (from the T-10K prototype) before securing its official designation and first flight was recorded on August 17th, 1987. Operational level service was attained in 1995 though the aircraft was not formally introduced into Russian Naval Aviation service until August 31st, 1998. Su-33s are assigned to the deck of the Admiral Kuznetsov - the only operational Russian Navy aircraft carrier in service (2012). Only 24 Su-33 systems have been produced to date (2012), showcasing the limited power of the modern Russian Navy compared with its land and air force strength. The navalized Mikoyan MiG-29K is set to replace the ship-based Su-33 fleet by 2015.\n\r\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Navy fell largely behind the West in terms of sea-based aerial firepower. With the VTOL Yakovlev Yak-38 (NATO: \"Forger\") being the only available mount, thought was given to modernizing the attack wing with a more flexible solution. In conjunction with this new requirement, a new carrier design was also formulized to expand the tactical capabilities of the Soviet Navy. By the late 1970s, the excellent Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" and Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" air superiority aircraft were both introduced and these became the basis for several navalized versions to follow (as the \"MiG-29K\" and \"Su-27K\" respectively). As the Soviet carriers was smaller in overall size when compared to US Navy full-size carriers, a ski ramp was affixed to the launching end of the flight deck. As such, the MiG-29K and Su-27K were appropriately modified for the role.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Su-33 shares the same smooth contours of the land-based Su-27 series. The aircraft is a single-seat mount powered by twin engines. Wings are high-mounted and well-swept along their leading edges. The cockpit is set to the front of the tubular fuselage and set well-aft of a long nose cone assembly. The pilot is afforded excellent views out of the cockpit thanks to its elevated positioning and lightly-framed canopy. Intakes used to aspirate the twin engine configuration are set well-aft of the cockpit and positioned along the underside of the aircraft.  The engines exhaust at the rear through conventional circular exhaust port rings. The Su-33 sports twin vertical tail fins and conventional tailplanes. The undercarriage is fully-retractable and consists of two single-wheeled main legs and a twin-wheeled nose leg. When at rest, the Su-33 maintains a very tall stance, with ample clearing of its underwing ordnance hardpoints.\n\r\nKey differences with the Su-33 are apparent when compared to the land-based Su-27 series and these have been necessitated by the confines of life at sea aboard space-strapped aircraft carriers. The undercarriage has been properly reinforced for the rigors of flight deck operations and an arrestor hook ensures short landing distances upon recovery. Each main wing assembly and horizontal tailplanes are constructed to fold upwards along the respective mid-points which drastically reduces its storage footprint. The Su-33 has also been given forward canards (small wing assemblies ahead of the main wings) and enlarged moving wing surfaces for improved low-speed stability, useful when taking-off from short runways or attempting to land on a moving runaway. The Su-33 has also been completed with an in-flight refueling probe which critically extends the aircraft's operational range to nearly limitless coverage over war theaters assuming proper maintenance cycles are also met.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-33 (Flanker-D)", "aircraft_type": "Carrier-Based Air Defense Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "aaa55c4b-f97e-472e-b5fa-353768ccc82a", "year_model": "1993", "description": "\r\n        \tBilled as \"The World's #1 Selling Helicopter\", the Robinson R44 has been a market success for the Robinson Helicopter Company. Its design is attributed to Frank D. Robinson with work having taken place during the 1980s (it became a further development of the earlier two-seat R22 model). The result is a multi-faceted, light-class, utility-minded helicopter that can count users from all over the globe - from Bolivia and Dominican Republic to the United States and Uruguay. The helicopter serves civilian, police and military markets and its inherent simplicity makes it a prime helicopter trainer. Introduced in 1993, the series has seen production figures reach nearly 6,000 units today (2018).\n\r\nThe R44 retains much of the form and function that made the R22 of 1979 such a success in its own right (4,600 units produced into 2016). It is powered by a single engine which drives a two-bladed main rotor unit and a two-bladed tail rotor unit. The main rotor sits high atop the mast which is housed within a solid structure and measures 33 feet in diameter. The tail rotor faces portside. The undercarriage is a simple twin-skid arrangement allowing for landings on virtually any relatively solid surface. The cockpit seats two in a typical side-by-side arrangement and there is transport space for two passengers (also seated side-by-side). Overall length is 38.2 feet with a height of 10.8 feet. Empty weight is 660lb against an MTOW of 1,135lb.\n\r\nDrive power (assuming the \"Raven II\" production form) is from a Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 6-cylinder fuel-injected engine developing 245 horsepower. This is used to drive both the main rotor over the fuselage and the tail rotor at the rear (the latter via a drive shaft in the tail stem). Maximum speed reaches 150 miles per hour while cruising speeds are generally seen around 130 mph. Range is out to 350 miles on internal fuel and altitudes are restricted to under 14,000 feet.\n\r\nA first-flight of the R44 was had on March 31st, 1990.

With the IL-86 developed in the early-to-mid-1970s, this mature airframe was selected for further development as a flying command post aircraft, resulting in the \"Maxdome\" offshoot. A first-flight involving a converted IL-86 airliner was had on March 5th, 1987 with deliveries following in 1988. Service introduction was unavoidably derailed by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 which led to official series introduction in 1992. Just four total aircraft were procured by the newly-minted Russian Air Force and this aging fleet continues in service today (2019).\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this IL-86 offshoot has been to support Russian governmental operations in the event of all-out war - namely nuclear war. This platform, therefore, is designed to keep high-ranking Russian personnel (including national leaders) out of harm's way, providing a \"flying headquarters\" of sorts while the situation on the ground is assessed and reacted to.

These were outfitted with 4 x Aviadvigatel (Soloviev) PS-90A turbofan engines of 35,300lb thrust and came available with a two-class configuration scheme able to seat about 260 passengers and fly out to ranges of 6,000 nautical miles. The planned, modified IL-96-300V, with its proposed dual \"Airstair\" access, was never furthered.\n\r\nThe IL-96M was developed as a three-class, 300+ passenger variant with Western customers in mind. This included a Western-style cockpit as well as support for the American 4 x Pratt & Whitney PW2337 turbofan engine. To this was added a 30-foot section of fuselage for increased operational ranges but differences with Boeing and the United States made sure this mark did not see the light of day. Similarly, the proposed IL-96T dedicated freighter model was doomed for at least the interim until re-engined with the local Aviadvigatel PS-90A1 turbofan and now built atop the newer, more capable IL-96-400 passenger-hauling form.\n\r\nThe IL-96-400 was based in the IL-96M complete with PS-90A1 turbofan engines and developed with a two-class configuration in mind, seating between 300 to 400 passengers and flying out to ranges of 5,400 nautical miles. Cuba ended up purchasing three of these aircraft in early-2013 while a single example was taken on by the Russian Air Force for the ACP role to succeed the aging IL-86 fleet. A short-lived version, the IL-96-400VT, was thought to have been proposed to the USAF for its aerial tanker requirement but held little chance in being selected by the service.\n\r\nThe IL-96-400T became the IL-96-400's dedicated freighter form and the IL-96-400TZ was proposed as an aerial tanker in 2015 for the Russian Air Force. It is unknown whether this mark has gained any steam in own development.\n\r\nThe IL-96-400M has emerged as the latest proposed form and features a lengthened fuselage and all-modern cockpit. This model is intended for service in the 2020s and beyond and is set to become the new in-service standard for the series. Able to carry just under 400 passengers, the IL-96-400M was, at least at one point, being partially financed by the Russian government.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-96", "aircraft_type": "Wide-Body, Long-Range Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "74d92681-aa2d-44f9-9d24-3b0551d442e4", "year_model": "1992", "description": "Sukhoi - Russia", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-31", "aircraft_type": "Single-Seat, Single-Engine Aerobatic Aircraft"}, {"id": "e34460aa-f9de-49e1-b7cb-bf1e338d855e", "year_model": "1991", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian-born Sukhoi Su-29 serves as a twin-seat, single-engine aerobatic performer.

It was designed by Alessandro Mazzoni and attempts to compete with jet-powered bizjets across the world relying instead on a twin turboprop engine configuration - these arranged as \"pushers\" facing the rear of the aircraft. A first-flight was recorded on September 23rd, 1986 and series introduction began on September 30th, 1990. It has remained in production since 1986 and has seen a modest total of 220 units completed for various customers in Bulgaria, Canada, Italy, Poland, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. It has also garnered some interest at the military level (the UAE uses two as part of its air force inventory) and has been developed into the crew-less P.1HH \"Hammerhead\" ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) drone system.\n\nA Brief Piaggio History\r\nPiaggio Aerospace has a history dating back to its founding by Rinaldo Piaggio in 1884 and was a primary aero-industry player of the Kingdom of Italy throughout World War 2 (1939-1945). It managed to survive the gutting of the Italian war machine of the post-World War 2 world and lived on through the Cold War period to the modern age where, today, it focuses on civilian and business market products like the P.180.\n\r\nThe financial boom of the 1980s prompted aircraft manufactures to satisfy a growing market need for sleek and fast VIP transports. Piaggio engineers went to work as early as 1979 on design studies which would eventually lead to the Avanti. This work spanned into 1981 and a patent for the unique design was secured in 1982. Development then proceeded with physical construction of the various aircraft components resulting in a prototype being made ready in 1986. A first-flight then followed. Civil market certification was not reached until 1990 however. The program suffered delays when, in 1994, financial woes struck the Avanti Aviation Wichita branch in the United States at which point Ferrari came to the rescue in 1998. From then on, the Avanti line has more or less been secured.\n\nP.180 walk-Around\r\nThe P-180 has a wholly unique appearance as VIP transports go: its nose cone is well-sloped ahead of the cockpit offering excellent vision for the flight crew. There is a small forward wing at the nose which creates a triple-plane configuration for the aircraft. The fuselage is relatively short, squat and tapered at both ends to promote a futuristic-like look for the compact business aircraft. The mid-mounted wing mainplanes are situated well-aft of midships and involve straight planes with clipped tips and engine nacelles running from ahead of the leading edges to well past the trailing edges. The nacelles are streamlined for aerodynamic efficiency and the engines arranged in a pusher configuration, driving multi-bladed propeller units. The tail consists of a T-style (Multhopp Tail) unit seating the horizontal planes at the very top of the single vertical fin. Delta-shaped near-ventral fins accompany the tail unit at the rear for additional stability. A tricycle landing gear is used for ground-running.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Piaggio P.180 Avanti", "aircraft_type": "Twin-Engine Turboprop VIP Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "ac2bf6b4-ab01-436b-8a6d-b00d5035d4a1", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tATR (Aerei da Trasporto Reionale / Avions de Transport Regional) was founded in 1981 as a joint venture between Aeritalia (now Leonardo) of Italy and Aerospatiale (now Airbus) of France. The company gained a modest following with their introduction of the \"ATR 42\" in 1985. Over 450 of the type followed in production and this design went on to serve as the basis for the larger \"ATR 72\" product.\n\r\nLike the ATR 42, the ATR 72 incorporated a high-wing mainplane arrangement offering strong lifting properties and good short-field operation. A \"T-style\" tail unit was used and a rounded, slim fuselage brought all of the components together in a single sleek offering. The undercarriage was wheeled and retractable. The engines were slung under the wing mainplanes and installed within streamlined nacelles. First-flight of a prototype was on October 27th, 1988 and service introduction (through Finnair) followed on October 27th, 1989. Over 900 of the type have been produced to date (2017) and several major variants have emerged throughout its run. The design has seen service in both civilian and military sectors, the latter being the Italian Air Force, the Pakistan Navy and the Turkish Navy.\n\nVariants\n\r\nThe original form was the ATR 72-100 which incorporated the ATR 72-101 of September 1989 powered by 2 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PW124B engines and featuring two crew access doors along the fuselage sides. The ATR 72-102 arrived in late-1989 with the same engines but a cargo door fitted at front and a crew door at rear. The ATR 72-200 was offered with PW124B engines of 2,400 horsepower (each). The ATR 72-201 and ATR 72-202 were primary products of the group and both featured increased MTOW because of the engine change. The ATR 72-210 sported a larger cargo door for improved access and a switch was made to PW127 engines of 2,750 horsepower (each). The powerplants gave the aircraft better \"hot and high\" performance and was fitted to both the ATR 72-211 and ATR 72-212 models of late 1992.\n\r\nThe ATR 72-212A, appearing in early 1997, was offered with a choice of engines - PW127F or PW127M. Each engine turned six-bladed propellers and performance was improved as a result (including MTOW). Additional benefits were added to the cockpit to help streamline operations. The ATR 72-500 was originally showcased as the ATR 72-500. A version with slightly different equipment was seen as the ATR 72-600.\n\nThe ATR 72-212A\n\r\nThe ATR 72-212A is crewed by two and seats 70 passengers. Overall length is 89 feet with a wingspan of 88.8 feet and a height of 25 feet. Empty weight is 28,682lb against a MTOW of 50,705lb. Performance includes a cruise speed of 315 mph, a range out to 950 miles and a service ceiling of 25,000 feet. Rate-of-climb is 1,355 feet-per-minute.\n\nOther Forms\n\r\nThe ATR 72 ASW variant was built to serve as a maritime (over water) patrol platform in military spheres. The design was built atop the framework of the ATR 72-212A offering and held provision for various navy-centric armament such as anti-ship missiles, torpedoes and depth charges. Beyond their given submarine-hunting capabilities, the aircraft could also be used in the Search And Rescue (SAR) role when needed.\n\r\nThe ATR 80 was a follow-up model intended to seat more passengers (78). A pair of Allison AE2100 turboprop engines were to power the aircraft. This project did not see much advancement.\n\nThe ATR 72 Today\n\r\nThe ATR 72 family continues in active service with various global operators. Its flying has, however, been marred by accidents - the first major one recorded in October of 1994 when an American Eagle flight crashed in Indiana (USA) killing all aboard. More recently, on February 4th, 2015, an ATR 72 operating under the banner of TransAsia Airways crashed into the Keelung River of Taipei - just fifteen of the 58 aboard survived. The devastating accident was caught on camera.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "ATR 72 (Avions de Transport Regional Model 72)", "aircraft_type": "Twin-Engine, Turboprop-Powered Regional Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "af02567b-256b-40c3-ae19-688e253d6f47", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviets progressed jet-powered amphibious aircraft more so than any world power during the Cold War years. Beriev, with a long-running history in flying boat designs, developed the Beriev A-40 \"Albatros\" (NATO codename: \"Mermaid\") which appeared in the mid-1980s. The aircraft was primarily developed as an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform and its amphibious capabilities allowed for it to take-off and land from a viable water source or a traditional runway as needed. Beriev had already sold its Be-12 \"Seagull\" to the Soviet Navy back in the 1960s and the A-40 was intended as its successor. It would also have replaced the land-based Ilyushin IL-38 ASW patrol platform which began service in 1967. However, with the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the program was shelved after only one prototype lay completed and a second nearing completion.\n\r\nDesign work on the type began in 1983 to which the aircraft received its first flight on December 8th, 1986. The first flight came about in accidental fashion when a high-speed taxi run found the crew with no runway distance to stop, forcing them airborne. The flight was accepted for what it was and important data collection occurred. The aircraft came as a surprise to Western observers when it was identified as an all-new type in 1988 via satellite photography. The first public unveiling was during the 1989 Soviet Aviation Day event at Tushino, Moscow.\n\r\nThe outward design of the A-40 included a tubular fuselage section containing the cockpit at its extreme forward end. The fuselage incorporated a smooth, boat-like hull for the projected water landing while a wheeled undercarriage was used for land-based sorties. High, shoulder-mounted wing appendages allowed for increased lift and low-level stability while supported on water through wingtip pontoons. The pair of jet engines were also high-mounted while fitted  aft of the main wing section and ahead of the tail unit. Each engine was seated atop structural extensions emanating from the wing trailing edges. The tail unit was a traditional \"T\" arrangement with high-mounted tailplanes. The wheeled undercarriage included a pair of four-wheeled main legs and a two-wheeled nose leg. A typical operating crew numbered eight to include a pair of pilots and systems specialists. An in-flight refueling probe was installed for extended endurance.\n\r\nPower for the aircraft was granted through 2 x Aviadvigatel (Soloviev) D-30KPV turbofan engines delivering 24,500lbs thrust each. The aircraft also relied on 2 x Klimov/RKBM (Kolesov) RD36-35 series turbojet \"boosters\" for its shorter take-off quality and these produced an additional 5,180lbs of thrust. Maximum speed was listed at 500 miles per hour with an overall range out to 2,200 miles, a service ceiling of 31,825 feet and a rate-of-climb of 5,900 feet per second. The A-40 was cleared to take-off in Sea State 6 (very rough waves reaching 6.5 feet) conditions.\n\r\nAs an active-seeking \"submarine hunter\", the A-40 was cleared for a variety of naval weapons including the Kh-35 (AS-20\"Kayak\") anti-ship missile, the Orlan (\"Sea Eagle\") torpedo and the Korshun (\"Kite\") guided missile. Support was also made for the dropping of depth charges and naval mines as well as sonobouys. Ordnance is managed through external underwing hardpoints or an internal bomb bay.\n\r\nBeyond the base A-40 designation (covering the two prototypes), the was to be evolved across several notable variants. The A-40M was intended for modernized versions with updated systems while A-40P was to be a dedicated fire-fighting platform. The A-40PM was a proposed dedicated passenger airliner-type model to which the Be-40PT was to serve in a modular passenger/cargo hauling fashion. A-42 would have marked a projected Search And Rescue (SAR) version and A-44 was to be a standalone maritime patrol platform. The A-42E was another proposed form, this intended as an export variant of the maritime patrol and SAR models.\n\r\nDespite its unfinished testing phase in the late 1980s, and coupled with the resurgence of Russian military spending, it has been stated that the Beriev A-40 is in consideration once again to replace the wholly-aged Be-12 and IL-38 lines for the modern Russian Navy. The Navy expects to field at least four of the type in its ASW and SAR configurations. The original Soviet Navy requirement was for twenty aircraft before the Soviet collapse.\n\r\nThe Beriev Be-200 is a related A-40 development which utilizes the same basic configuration and stands as a more modern, refined offering. The Be-200 achieved its first flight in 1998 and entered service in 2003 to which nine of the series have been completed up to December 2013. Several variants of this aircraft exist though only Azerbaijan and Russia are its formal operators. While Beriev is the aircraft designer, Irkut is the primary manufacturer of the newer aircraft.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Beriev Be-42 Albatros (Mermaid) (A-40)", "aircraft_type": "Amphibious Maritime Patrol / ASW Aircraft"}, {"id": "3977fa98-5ff1-4210-9043-840693db5bbf", "year_model": "1989", "description": "\r\n        \tSince its inception, the Tupolev-produced Tu-160 (NATO codename of \"Blackjack\", nicknamed in Russia/Soviet Union as the \"White Swan\") has been the largest jet-powered, swing-wing combat aircraft platform ever produced, mounting the most powerful jet engines fitted to any military aircraft. Developed as a direct counter-product to the United States Air Force's Rockwell B-1 \"Lancer\" strategic bomber, the Tu-160 was designed to fulfill the slightly different role of stand-off missile launching. In contrast, the B-1 served primarily to deliver of large amounts of precision munitions in the form of cruise missiles and other potent air-to-surface types. The Tupolev system, though having mostly fallen to general neglect and under-use since the close of the Cold War, has received some recent attention as Russia strives to regain her former military glory. Though looking every bit a direct copy of the B-1 bomber, the Tu-160 is in fact many times larger than her American counterpart - though no less lethal - and sports better range and a larger munitions capability.\n\r\nOrigins of the Tu-160 date as far back as the United States North American XB-70 Valkyrie supersonic, long-range Mach 3.0-capable bomber project. The USAF project was a promising venture and two prototypes were eventually built and tested. One was tragically lost to an in-flight accident with a chase plane and the entire program was eventually cancelled. In 1967, half-a-world-away, the Soviet Union herself was beginning to move on a similar program. The agreed requirement came down for a supersonic bomber capable of Mach 3 speed. Similarly to the XB-70 program, the Soviet attempt was far-reaching and much less fruitful, the general realization being that such a system was beyond reach of becoming an effective solution.\n\r\nAs a result, product requirements were scaled back and, in 1972, a new Soviet attempt was launched for a like-minded system within a shorter scope. This airframe would make use of variable-geometry wings and reach supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2.3. The new product was to match wits with the equally-new Rockwell B-1A Lancer strategic bomber gaining steam in the United States. Tupolev, under the direction of V. I. Bliznuk, delivered their supersonic Tu-144-inspired \"Aircraft 160M\" large-scale bomber design into the fold and the Blackjack legacy was more-or-less born. Tupolev's design competed against a Sukhoi T-4 and Myasishchev M-18 offering and, while the Myasishchev product was generally accepted as the \"winning\" design, the Tupolev firm was elected in 1973 to head its development based on their successful history and overall potential in approaching the new Soviet bomber initiative.\n\r\nThough development of the B-1A Lancer was stopped (for a time) in 1977, development of the Tu-160 continued until production resulted in about 30 such examples - with roughly 19 of these resided in the Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union. Eight of these were later transferred back to Russian hands in a debt-relief agreement at the beginning of 2000. It is suspect as to whether Ukraine maintains the military infrastructure to field their remaining Tu-160s. Some sources also stated that Ukraine lent or sold up to three non-military Tu-160 examples to the United States to be used as \"satellite-launching platforms\". Interesting in that the United States generally launches any satellite by way of Titan rockets.\n\r\nIn all, the Tu-160 family includes a variety of forms, some produced in quantity and others reserved for experimentation. The Tu-160S was used to designation serial production Tu-160s and define experimental versions from their pre-production counterparts. The Tu-160M is a modernized, lengthened version fielding two Kh-90 hypersonic (beyond Mach 5.0) long range missiles. The Tu-160P was a long-range version while the Tu-160PP was a dedicated Electronic Warfare Aircraft (EWA) platform fitted with Electronic CounterMeasures gear. The Tu-160R was a true strategic reconnaissance product. The Tu-160SK served in a \"commercial\" format, utilized as a satellite-launching platform. The Tu-170 was a designation used for conventional bomber Tu-160s in an effort to skirt the SALT-2 treaty limitations.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-160 (Blackjack)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Long-Range Heavy Supersonic Bomber Aircraft"}, {"id": "88d741eb-c839-4f48-89f4-9bc00571a8d5", "year_model": "1988", "description": "\r\n        \tThe A320 family of jet airliners was introduced on April 18th, 1988 with launch carrier Air France in a move by the company to corner the narrow-body jet airliner market (facing competition from both Boeing and Douglas at the time). The series is intended for short-to-medium range routes and is powered by a pair of underslung turbofan engines. Key customers include American Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, and EasyJet. Production of the series has been ongoing since 1986 and some 7,400 of the type have been produced / delivered (as of late-2016).\n\r\nThe Airbus A320 family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321. The A320neo (neo = \"New Engine Option\") is another derivative introduced as a narrow-body, twin-engine passenger hauler in 2016 (Lufthansa). These give the customer engine options centering on either the CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G series engines. The introduction of \"neo\" has led to the original A320 model line being referred to as \"ceo\" (ceo = \"Current Engine Option\").\n\r\nThe A320 series was formed from the A300 series work and emerged in the early 1970s. While the A300 (A310) was always intended for the long-range market, its variant could be developed for shorter routes using the same framework. Serious work on the project occurred in the late-1970s and the project was officially born in early-1981 as the \"A320\". The design was to carry around 150 passengers out to 3,440 kilometers. Engineers were allowed to feature Fly-by-Wire (FbW) control systems - the first commercial airliner to rely on this digitally-assisted control scheme commonly found on military-grade fighter-type aircraft. A first-flight by way of prototype was had on February 22nd, 1987 and Type Certification was reached on February 26th, 1988. Service entry occurred in March 1988. Deliveries of the A320 family truly ramped up at the end of the 1990s to which point the line overtook the competing Boeing 737.\n\r\nThe A320 was initially seen in two major variants: A320-100 and A320-200. The -100 saw only modest product with just twenty-one aircraft completed. The -200 model incorporated wingtip fencing as well as an increase to fuel capacity, enabling longer, more fuel-efficient flights to be undertaken. Both were 150-passenger models. The -200 mark enjoyed a healthier production run numbering thousands.\n\r\nThe A321 was a stretched fuselage offering (increased by 22.8 feet). A first-flight was recorded on March 11th, 1993 and service entry followed in January of 1994 (Lufthansa). The A321-200 was a longer-ranged model with more powerful engines.\n\r\nThe A319 was a short-fuselage model (decreased by 12.2 feet) with 124-passenger capability. Various engine options became available to customers. Service introduction followed in April 1996 (SwissAir). The A319CJ became the \"Corporate Jet\" version of the mark (rebranded to \"ACJ319\").\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Airbus A320", "aircraft_type": "Narrow-Body Short-to-medium Route Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "373ab9bf-eb83-46d1-a524-991a84e5765e", "year_model": "1987", "description": "\r\n        \tOne of the more interesting of the Cold War aircraft developments became the massive Soviet Lun Ekranoplan (NATO codename of \"Duck\"), a flying boat of sorts designed around the use of turbojet propulsion, ground effect physics and a boat-like airframe hull. The design intent was a sea-skimming transport vehicle for the Soviet Navy armed with anti-ship missiles and cannon to counter the threat of Western surface fleet interference. The Lun entered service in 1987 - just prior to the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991 - and was built in just one production-quality example as the \"MD-160\". The MD-160 began operational service with the Black Sea Fleet with its design attributed to engineer Rostislav Evgenievich Alexseev.\n\r\nGround effect allowed designers to utilize the inherent reaction of a winged airframe with the naturally occurring forces found near the surface of the earth. In effect, the aircraft was designed to skin the surface as if a hovercraft, though achieving greater altitudes. Ground effect allows an aircraft to utilize lower lift-dependent drag and, theoretically, provide greater efficiency in its forward momentum. The Lun Ekranoplan became an excellent example of this achievable principle though its kind has yet to find widespread use.\n\r\nExternally, the Lun was a mix of boat and aircraft, showcasing a very bow-like fuselage with straight, mid-mounted wing appendages (capped by pontoons), a single vertical tail fin mounting a pair of swept-back horizontal planes in a \"T\" style arrangement and a forward-set flight deck. No fewer than 8 x Kuznetsov NK-87 series turbojet engines were fitted, these along the forward section of the fuselage just aft of the cockpit, and set as two groups of four engines each. As such, the engines could cleanly aspirate from the front in the usual manner and exhaust aft, over the main wing assemblies. The engine arrangement netted a thrust output of 28,000lbs each, propelling the Lun at speeds equaling 342 miles per hour over water. Operational range was 1,200 miles (1,000 nautical miles) with the vehicle crewed by fifteen including six officers. The Lun was designed to haul up to 220,000lbs to 300,000lbs of goods in its deep boat-like hull. The nose housed a Puluchas search radar suite.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Lun (Ekranoplan)", "aircraft_type": "Ground Effect Flying Boat / Anti-Ship Warfare Aircraft"}, {"id": "015a3408-172f-49d0-a92a-8268014a315f", "year_model": "1987", "description": "\r\n        \tVertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) flight of fixed-wing fighter aircraft eluded aeronautical engineers for decades until several of the many initiatives of the 1960s ultimately yielded viable forms. The most famous of these became the British \"Harrier\" which was produced in two distinct marks - a land-based attack form and the \"Sea Harrier\" navalized form, the latter seeing combat service during the Falkland War of 1982. For the Soviet Union, the concept only ever truly materialized in the Yakovlev Yak-38 \"Forger\" which served the Soviet Navy from 1976 to 1991. 231 of the type were produced but these aircraft were limited in their ordnance-carrying capabilities and overall performance - as such not an outright success. Other programs, such as the Yak-36 \"Freehand\" of 1963 (the program yielding four prototypes), helped to further the Soviet goal of VTOL fighter flight.\n\r\nIn 1975, Yakovlev OKB was directly given the task of broadening the capabilities of its Yak-36 design with a formal government contract. The product was envisioned to become a fleet defense fighter for the Soviet Navy with inherent supersonic capabilities to keep pace with fighters of the West. This meant that the aircraft would have to display fighter-like qualities such as agility, sound weapons integration, and performance for the ranged interception role needed against incoming aerial threats. The new VTOL fighter program was born under the \"Product 48\" name and came to be known by the Soviet Navy as \"Yak-41\".\n\r\nDesign studies began to weed out incompatible engine arrangements and configurations. The chief challenge lay in providing supersonic performance while maintaining a vectored thrust capability and this led engineers to adopt a single-engine layout for both safety and simplicity. The thrust vectoring would come from a nozzle set at amidships in the fuselage (aided by smaller \"thrust jets\" installed at the forward section of the airframe) and general forward thrust/lifting through a jetpipe at the rear of the aircraft. The rear jetpipe was designed to turn down to 90 degrees to further support the VTOL action at the rear of the aircraft - an arrangement now seen in the American Lockheed F-35 \"Lightning II\" 5th Generation strike fighter.\n\r\nWith this single engine layout in mind, engineers developed the airframe to include twin tailbooms straddling either side of the engine installation. The remainder of the aircraft mimicked the design lines seen in previous Soviet high-speed aircraft of the period - namely the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" and MiG-31 \"Foxhound\" with their slab-sided forward fuselages, large and rectangular intake openings (located to either side of the cockpit), and small-area wings clipped at their ends and showcasing sweep along their leading edges. The wing mainplanes were designed with a folding feature to aid in carrier storage and the reinforced wheeled tricycle undercarriage was retractable. Titanium was used to protect those surfaces expected to be exposed to the extreme temperatures of the list units while general areas were completed with composites where possible. The Yak-41 design ultimately utilized a three-engine layout. Its primary forward thrusting/lift unit was a Soyuz R-79V-300 turbofan engine outputting 24,300lbf on dry thrust and 34,170lbf with afterburner engaged. The lift engines comprised 2 x RKBM RD-41 turbojets delivering 9,300lbf of thrust apiece.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-41 (Freestyle / Yak-141)", "aircraft_type": "Prototype VTOL Fleet Defense Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "d4c96193-ffd1-414d-aefa-48ffe2b94b41", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-124 (NATO codename of \"Condor\") was the world's largest aircraft before the Antonov An-225 made its debut. The An-124 was developed specifically as a replacement for the aging An-22 with a military mission scope similar to the American Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, sharing a similar configuration.\n\r\nThe An-124 utilizes both nose and cargo doors for simultaneous loading and unloading and can move tons of supplies and equipment at the strategic theater level. Her listed empty eight is 175,000 kilograms which is superseded by a maximum take-off weight of 405,000 kilograms showcasing  type's hauling capabilities. Power is served through 4 x Ivchenko Progress D-18T series turbofan engines developing 51,600lbs of thrust each. The engine configuration allows for a top speed of 540 miles per hour, a cruise speed of 500 miles per hour, a range out to 3,300 miles with a service ceiling of nearly 40,000 feet (39,400 listed, all factors of course load-dependent).\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the An-124 is highly conventional with a wide, deep fuselage assembly capped by a high-mounted flight deck at the front and an elevated tail unit at the rear. The tail is finished with a single vertical tail fin and low-mounted horizontal planes. The elevated nature of the appendage allows for rear cargo access through proper structural clearance. This requires a strong support structure at the center of the design and the An-124 does not disappoint with 24 wheels managed by two main undercarriage positions under the main section of the fuselage. The nose is supported by a two-wheeled leg in turn. \n\r\nAs with other aircraft of this type, the An-124 makes use of shoulder-mounted wing assemblies offering excellent ground clearance. Each wing sports noticeable sweep along their leading and trailing edges, offering the required handling at low-speeds. Each wing also manages a pair of underwing engine nacelles which provide the necessary thrust for the platform.\n\r\nAs of this writing (2013), many An-124s actually sport civilian markings for they make exceptional material-hauling transports. Libya owns a pair of An-124s while Ukraine operates some seven units. The UAE manages a single example. Russian firms Aeroflot, Ayaks, Russian State Transport Company and Transaero Airlines each operate the type. The Russian Air Force remains the only military operator of the An-124 with 25 examples across the 12th Military Transport Air Division and the 224th Air Detachment of Military Transport Aviation. The United Kingdom was a former limited civilian operator of the type when several concerns - Air Foyle, HeavyLift Cargo Airlines, Antonov AirTrack, Titan Cargo and TransCharter Titan Cargo - made use of the series. All have since been dissolved or have gone out of operations involving An-124s.\n\r\nOver 50 examples have been produces since service introduction occurred in 1986. The series has existed in several notable variant forms including the base An-124 transport. The An-124-100 is a commercial cargo hauler while the similar An-124-100M-150 is outfitted with Western-minded avionics equipment.  The An-124-102 is another commercial variant. The An-124-130 existed as a proposed variant that fell to naught. The An-124-135 proved another air freighter variant. The An-124-150 remains a proposed upgraded mount as does the An-124-200, the latter intended to be powered by American General electric CF6-80C2 series turbofan engines of 60,000lbs thrust each. The An-124-300 is the most modern and technologically advanced offering of the An-124 family, having entered service in number with the Russian Air Force.\n\r\nIt was reported in January of 2013 that a new initiative by Volga-Dnepr Group of Russia is pushing for a restart of An-124 production.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-124 Ruslan (Condor)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Heavy-Lift Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "01b05406-24c7-46cb-8d82-bf3cc6160da0", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-28 (NATO Codename of \"Cash\") was born from the Cold War period (1947-1991) in Ukraine as a high-winged, twin-engine, turbo-prop-powered utility aircraft. The series was a further evolution of the earlier An-14 line and a first-flight in prototype form occurred in September of 1969 (though service introduction stalled until  1986). Production of the series spanned from 1975 until 1993 to which 191 examples were completed and the An-28 went on to form the basis of the similar An-38 regional turboprop airliner of 2000.\n\r\nThe high-winged nature of the aircraft (and others like it) promoted inherently strong lifting properties and excellent control at low-and-slow speeds. The main wing members were braced at their span to the lower sides of the fuselage and the overall configuration aided in Short-Take-Off-and-Landing (STOL) actions while the general ruggedness of the airframe and undercarriage allowed for some level of rough-field operation. The general appearance of the fuselage was slab-sided with windowed sides and a lightly framed cockpit section. The tail unit was raised to allow for better ground access to the cargo section of the aircraft. The tail unit utilized a twin-rudder/fin arrangement carried over from the An-14. The undercarriage consisted of a wheeled tricycle arrangement that remained fixed in flight - negating the need for any complex and expensive retractable system.\n\r\nThe original designation for the product was \"An-14A\" as it served as an extension of that line. It emerged in prototype form as the \"An-14M\" and evolved into the production-quality \"An-28\" - but only three of this mark were completed.\n\r\nThe An-28 could be operated with a crew of one or two and carry up to eighteen passengers in some comfort. The cabin could also be rearranged to carry cargo. Overall length of the aircraft reached 42.57 feet with a wingspan measuring 72.18 feet and a height of 15.08 feet. Empty weight was 8,600lb against an MTOW of 13,450lb. Power was from 2 x Glushenkov TVD-10B turboprop engines of 960 horsepower each. These were used to drive three-bladed propeller units. Performance of the model included a maximum speed of 220 miles per hour, a range out to 320 miles and a service ceiling of 19,700 feet. Rate-of-climb was 2,360 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe An-28RM \"Bryza\" 1RM was a modified air-ambulance / Search And Rescue (SAR) platform and the An-28TD \"Bryza\" 1TD was evolved as a general transport model. The An-28PT of 1993 was equipped with 2 x Pratt & Whitney turboprop engines instead of the original Soviet fits. A first-flight of this mark was recorded on July 22nd, 1993.\n\r\nDespite its modest production total, the An-28 went on to see global service in both civilian and military marketplaces (though some carriers have since given up on the line due to age). Current (2018) civilian operators include Armenia, Russia and Tajikistan. Current military operators involve Georgia and Tanzania.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-28 (Cash)", "aircraft_type": "Light Utility, Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) Aircraft"}, {"id": "5c8a2e39-92c0-47bf-8402-e2fab8468ce0", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tBecause of the sheer size of the Soviet military during the Cold War era (1947-1991), its various services required various transport types to move man, machines and supplies about. The Antonov An-72 (NATO codename of \"Coaler\") became a product of the period, intended for the logistically-minded tactical transport role. The rather unique aircraft incorporated turbofan engines over the shoulder-mounted wings which made for maximum clearance of the jet wash and promoted excellent inherent lifting properties. The An-72 was eventually adopted as a successor to the aging Antonov An-26 \"Curl\" transport family (detailed elsewhere on this site) and would go on to see service with various Soviet states and allied nations around the globe.\n\r\nFirst flying in December of 1977 (in prototype form of which two would be built), actual production models were not available until the mid-1980s and, even then, these were highly-modified from their original presented forms. The An-72 was designed with Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) in mind so robustness and reliability were key qualities but an natural capability became excellent maneuverability despite the size of the aircraft. The high-mounted engines were purposefully placed so the engine exhaust could feed over trailing edge wing devices, effectively increasing low-level performance.\n\r\nThe An-72 (\"Coaler-A\") platform went on to spawn other variants that included the maritime surveillance-minded An-72P (Patrol), the An-71 \"Madcap\" AEW (Airborne Early Warning) aircraft and the An-74 \"Improved Coaler\", the latter with upgraded engines and a more traditional/conventional engine mounting. The An-72P was developed in conjunction with Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) and featured a revised \"glass\" cockpit, specialized Elta-brand radar, and an Electronic Warfare (EW) fit as well as long-range day-or-night observation equipment and related systems/subsystems. It also held provision for rocket and bombs and was armed through a single 23mm GSh-23L series autocannon. The An-72AT was a dedicated transport developed to accommodate foreign shipping containers. The An-72S became a VIP transport and could be used in the MEDEVAC role when configured as such.\n\r\nAbout 195 of the series were built under the An-72 and An-74 guises and production has spanning from 1977 to the present. The An-74 was developed (and produced in parallel to the An-72) along the lines of cold weather support and operated through a crew of five, added more fuel storage and installed a larger radar. It was introduced in 1983.\n\r\nAnother notable offshoot, the An-71, emerged in 1985 through a first-flight on July 12th. Only three prototypes of this mark were produced and the variant's program was ultimately cancelled. The version was intended for the Tactical AWACS (Airborne Early Warning And Control = AEW&C) role and carried a dish installation over the rear fuselage.\n\r\nCurrent (2017) military operators of the Coaler family line include Equatorial Guinea, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. The type also sees service in the civilian sector with various operators worldwide. Several have already given up on the series for more modern designs.\n\r\nAs designed, the An-72 featured a length of 92 feet, a wingspan of 104.7 feet and a height of 28.4 feet. Empty weight was 42,000lb against an MTOW of 76,060lb. Power was served from 2 x Lotarev D-36 1A turbofan engines developing upwards of 14,330lb of thrust (each) and maximum speed reached 435 miles-per-hour with a cruising speed of around 375 mph. Range was listed out to 2,690 miles.\n\r\nThe An-72/An-74 series eventually took on the nickname of \"Cheburashka\", a Soviet cartoon character, owing to its large over-wing engines resembling the character's large ears.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-72 / An-74 (Coaler)", "aircraft_type": "Tactical Medium Military Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "1bad8f5f-0fe2-4e4f-a336-f04ce16864d4", "year_model": "1986", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Falcon 900 is a triple-engined business jet (\"BizJet\") actively marketed by Dassault Aviation of France since the mid-1980s. The aircraft is intended for the business industry / VIP role, ferrying important clients and customers to-and-fro. The type has been well-received since market introduction in 1986 and over 500 airframe have been produced to date (2022). A first-flight was had on September 21st, 1984 and production began in 1984.\n\r\nThe latest, most modern iteration of the Falcon 900 line is the \"Falcon 900LX\".\n\r\nIn typical Dassault fashion, the Falcon 900 exudes clean lines and aerodynamic efficiency. Mainplanes are swept back, positioned at midships, and mounted low in the design. The fuselage's nosecone is just ahead of the cockpit with its slim shaping providing excellent vision for the two pilots within. Six windows provide viewing for the crewmen seated side-by-side. The fuselage is further tubular in its general shape and capped by a single rudder fin with outward-extending horizontal planes mounted at its base. Entry to the cabin/cockpit is by way of a folding staircase at the port side of the fuselage. A tricycle undercarriage, featuring double-bogies at each leg, is used for ground-running and is completely retractable into the airframe.\n\r\nIn the Falcon 900, the triple-engine arrangement seats all three turbofans at the rear of the fuselage, cutting down on cabin noise as much as possible. A pair of these sit on wingstubs outboard of the empennage while the third unit is embedded at the base of the rudder plane. This configuration allows for exceptional performance for this business jet and provides excellent operating range to boot.\n\r\nInternally, the cabin is made up to best serve business personnel and can be equipped with leather-appointed seats (dual or single), sofas, work tables, monitors, and the like in a single-aisle arrangement. Round porthole windows provide viewing outside and allow natural lighting inside the interior. A full galley and rest room make up the standard amenities of the luxury aircraft. Beds can be formed from the passenger seats for long-haul routes. Range is such that a flight departing from London, England and reach out to central United States in the West and middle China in the East.\n\r\nThe flight deck (Falcon 900LX) is all-modern with digital processing and automation as standard. It is comprised of the \"EASy II\" series avionics fit enhancing situational awareness, safety, and comfort. Head-Up Displays (HUDs) provide pilots with pertinent performance and operating figures and cues reducing the need to look away from the window screens and the terrain ahead. The unique, optional \"FalconEye\" suite further increases safety and it provides unparalleled cockpit vision in day-night environments and all-weather situations.\n\r\nVariants of the line include the original 1984 Falcon 900 powered by 3 x Garret TFE731-5AR-1C non-afterburning turbofan engines of 4,500 lb thrust each. Certification followed in 1986. The Falcon 900B followed in 1991 with 3 x TFE731-5BR-1C engines of 4,750 lb thrust each. The B-model was then itself succeeded by the Falcon 900C of 2000 bringing along with it more modern amenities and enhanced performance for a new generation of customers.\n\r\nThe Falcon 900EX of 1986 became a dedicated long-range offering, increasing operational range out to 4,500 nautical miles with its 3 x TFE731-60 series engines. The Falcon 900EX EASy introduced the new avionics set. The Falcon 900DX was a short-haul form with 3 x TFE731-60 engines. The Falcon 900LX is the modern incarnation of the Falcon 900 line and features a range out to 4,750 nautical miles.\n\r\nThe Japanese Coast Guard operates the Falcon 900 through its Falcon 900 MSA variant for maritime patrol duties. The Italian military has operated two distinct forms of the Falcon 900 - the Falcon 900EX becoming the VC-900A and the Falcon 900EASy becoming the VC-900B. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) selected the Falcon 900LX to succeed an aging line of BAe 146 aircraft in the VIP role.\n\r\nCurrent (2022) civilian market operators of the Falcon 900 line range from Libya to Saudi Arabia. Military operators include France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, and Switzerland (among others).

One of its most successful commercial products is the medium-lift PZL W-3 \"Sokol\" (\"Falcon\"), a multi-role-minded rotary-wing platform which continues to serve many global operators ranging from Algeria and Chile to Spain and Uganda. The product is something of a national success story for Poland as it became the first completely indigenous helicopter  (designed and developed in-house) to emerge from the former Soviet-aligned country. However, production totals have been rather modest when compared to other more high-profile helicopters of same role, reaching only some 150 units to date (2018) with manufacture spanning from 1986 to the present.\n\nW-3 Sokol Development\n\r\nDesign work began in 1973 as a local initiative to satisfy both military and civilian markets, primarily those in the Soviet sphere of influence. For the rigors of both industries, a twin-engine design was selected which aided reliability and survivability as well as met the medium-lift requirement. The overall configuration of the helicopter was largely conventional with the engines installed over the passenger cabin roof. A four-bladed main rotor was used for lift and this coupled with a three-bladed tail rotor (facing starboard) for stability. The undercarriage was wheeled for ground-running but fixed in place during flight. The pilots took up positions overlooking the short nose section in the usual way with the cockpit offering commanding views of the action around the helicopter's frontal section.\n\r\nA first-flight was recorded on November 16th, 1979, delayed by a very long development phase which presented its set of challenges, launching what would become a storied service career. This then spurred low-rate production beginning in 1985 (while there still was a Soviet Union).\n\nSokol Civilian Marks\n\r\nThe W-3 Sokol fed the civilian market through several designs: W-3 was used to mark the base multi-purpose, utility-minded platforms of which thirty units followed to the standard. W-3A were FAR-29 certified and the E-3AS were W-3 airframes converted to the newer W-3A standard, twenty-two emerging from production. The W-3A2 was given a twin-axis Smith SN350 series autopilot system though only a single example was built. The W-3AM was completed with floats for on-water landings and thirteen were delivered to the standard. The W-3 \"Erka\" was proposed for the air-ambulance role but only a single example was realized.\n\nSokol Military Marks\n\r\nThe Sokol went on to shine for the military market: Initial, unarmed marks became the W-3, W-3T and W-3P. The W-3P became a VIP passenger transport and the W-3W/W-3WA were armed versions fitting 2 x 23mm GSz-23L series autocannons as well as four weapons hardpoints; thirty-four were built to the standard. The W-3AE was taken on by the Polish Army as a MEDEVAC platform and three were converted from the armed W-3WA mark. Another MEDEVAC form emerged through two examples as the W-3R, these used by the Polish Air Force. The service also had six W-3RL models for the Search and Rescue (SAR) role.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "PZL W-3 Sokol", "aircraft_type": "Multi-role Military / Civilian Utility Helicopter"}, {"id": "1c88d1ef-3650-4be9-97fe-0827854dfba7", "year_model": "1985", "description": "\r\n        \tDesigned as a counter to the excellent American swing-wing Grumman F-14 \"Tomcat\" carrierborne fleet defender and the classic McDonnell Douglas F-15 \"Eagle\" air superiority fighter, the Soviet/Russian Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" became an instant classic when introduced into service during June of 1985. The twin-engined heavy platform evolved from its air superiority roots to become a complete multirole fighter during its lengthy time aloft. Even today the series continues as a frontline answer to the West's 4th Generation types and the line has evolved to include the related Su-30, Su-33 and Su-35 as well as several Chinese-originated offshoots. It is expected that the Su-27 family will maintain a presence over the modern battlefield for some decades more even as the in-development Sukhoi T-50 PAK-FA (detailed elsewhere on this site) makes its appearance in suitable numbers for the Russian Air Force.\n\nSu-27 Origins\n\r\nOrigins of the Su-27 place it back in the 1970s when the Soviet Air Force and Ministry of Aircraft Industry joined resources to study concepts for future Soviet fighter platforms. Multirole models were the call of the day - a single aircraft to accomplish various roles such as interception, air defense neutralization and ground attack. Air powers typically adopted two aircraft classes to meet the need - a medium-to-heavy  model alongside a lightweight performer. For the United States, this ultimately became the F-15/F14 paired with the General Dynamics F-16 \"Fighting Falcon\".\n\r\nFor the heavy-class fighter,  the Soviet focus fell to a design expected to showcase excellent performance and maneuverability despite its size while the lightweight aircraftlwent on to become the Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\". The heavy fighter force would account for over one-quarter of the Russian Air Force fleet, the lightweight development used to fill the rest of the stock - built along the lines of economic mass production and readily available to Soviet export allies around the world.\n\r\nCentral Research and Development Institute No. 30 pressed ahead and drew up plans for a new heavy fighter form, giving it a sleek, wing-body blending shape with twin vertical tail fins set atop and a twin engine arrangement. The wing-body arrangement provided the strength needed to carry large, heavy war loads and the twin engine configuration offered the necessary power and survivability needed of a high performance combat craft (should one engine be lost in combat, the aircraft held a better chance of returning home with the intact powerplant still in play). Situational awareness for the pilot was to be handled by an advanced onboard suite as well as a bubble-style canopy offering excellent all-around vision. Powerful scan-and-tracking radar would be fitted in the nosecone.\n\nSukhoi T10\n\r\nThe design was designated internally as \"T10\" and constituted the blended wing-body form (as the \"T10-1\") alongside a more conventional winged design (the \"T10-2\"). The latter design was dropped when it was deemed the advantages of the first offering were worth the risk and investment. With the design more or less fleshed out, power-players Sukhoi, Mikoyan and Yakovlev competed for the Ministry contract with a formal Air Force review coming in 1972. The Sukhoi design won out while Mikoyan was selected to fulfill the lightweight fighter requirement (producing the MiG-29). Engineering work continued on the T10 leading to many refinements until finalization was had by 1975. Construction on the flyable prototype was then begun.\n\r\nEngines used to power the fighter would come from Lyulka and they produced the AL-31F turbofan engine. With origins in the AL-21F-3 afterburning turbojet, the AL-31 series also offered afterburner capability and two of its kind would be used to power the Sukhoi prototype.\n\r\nShould the aircraft come to pass, the T10 would become the first Soviet aircraft to feature a true Fly-By-Wire (FBW) controlling with no mechanical linkage set between the control systems and the wing surface areas. Avionics would of course be state-of-the-art for the time and include a Head-Up Display (HUD) offering pertinent performance and mission information. A Fire Control Radar (FCR) and electro-optoelectronic targeting system would make the fighter a lethal adversary by assisting the pilot in all facets of targeting and engagement. Like the MiG-29, the Sukhoi T10 would also be fitted with an avionics suite largely digital in nature - another Soviet first for a combat aircraft.\n\r\nAll new missiles were also in development to round out the list of components necessary in bringing to life a frontline fighting machine to contend with anything the West could offer now and in the near future.\n\nDevelopment\n\r\nThe T10 prototype recorded its first flight on May 20th, 1977 and managed nearly forty flights into January of 1978 before ending its days as a museum showpiece. Early testing magnified aerodynamic issues that were appropriately dealt with. However, the program suffered a major setback when the second prototype was lost in a fatal crash on May 7th, 1978.\n\r\nThat same year, work began on construction of the third prototype which introduced outward-canted tailfins as well as being outfitted with the AL-31F series engines. This forced a major revision of the engine housings from intake to exhaust port to accommodate the powerplants. The aircraft was used as both an engine testbed and as a naval fighter prototype - completing ski-jump take-offs and being finished with arrestor gear and a reinforced undercarriage for the role. For 1983, a fourth prototype joined the stable for service as an avionics and weapons testbed. It claimed its first flight in October of 1979. A long range of prototypes then followed including high-speed, high-performance types intended for record-setting exercises. Even as the Su-27 entered serial production and frontline service, development continued on bettering the line.\n\nSu-27 Variants\n\r\nThe Su-27 managed a plethora of variants and designations throughout its flying career. The original prototype was the aforementioned \"T10\" (known to NATO as \"Flanker-A\") and T10S followed with an improved configuration mimicking production standard Flankers more closely. \"Su-27\" was used to mark pre-production vehicles with the AL-31 series engine. Rounded wingtips were a physical difference of early Su-27 aircraft.\n\r\nThe initial production-quality fighter became \"Su-27S\" (NATO codename of \"Flanker-B\") and these were single-seat fighters fitted with improved AL-31F engines, leading edge slats, and clipped wingtips. The vertical tail surfaces were moved further outboard as well. Su-27P became an air superiority / interceptor model lacking ground attack functionality, primarily issued to the Soviet Air Defense Forces. Su-27PU (to become the Su-30) evolved into a two-seat model based on the Su-27P interceptor - these carried equipment to help support older Soviet fighters then in service. The mark was later revised to become multirole platforms for export.\n\r\nSu-27UB became two-seat trainers (\"Flanker-C\") arriving in 1986 with a second cockpit for the instructor (at the expense of internal fuel and operating range). The Su-27S was exported as \"Su-27SK\" and the \"Su-27UB\" two-seat trainer was sold abroad as the \"Su-27UBK\". China evolved the Su-27SK as the Shenyang J-11 (detailed elsewhere on this site). Trainer forms retained all of their combat capability despite their primary role of flying classroom.\n\r\nThe Su-27SK variant was given an overall length of 72 feet, a wingspan of 48.2 feet and a height of 19.5 feet. Empty weight was 36,100 lb against a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 67,100 lb. Power is from 2 x Lyulka (Saturn) AL-31F turbofan engines developing 16,910 lb of dry thrust and 27,560 lb of thrust with afterburner engaged. Maximum speed reached Mach 2.35 or 1,550 miles per hour at altitude. Range is out to 2,200 miles and a service ceiling of 62,523 feet is reported. Rate-of-climb is listed at 59,000 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe Su-27SK carried a standard, fixed armament in the form of 1 x GSh-30-1 series internal cannon with 150 rounds afforded. Ten external hardpoints were in play capable of carrying up to 9,770 lb of stores for either Air-to-Air (AA) or Air-to-Surface (AS) sorties. A typical fighter/interceptor loadout became 6 x R-27 medium-range AA missiles with 2 x R-73 short-range AA missiles. Those Flankers equipped for ground attack had their armament load capabilities broadened considerably and carried anything from conventional drop stores and precision-guided munitions to guided missiles and rocket pods. Specialized mission forms were also forged, these equipped with anti-ship and anti-radar missiles.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-27 (Flanker)", "aircraft_type": "Air Superiority / Ground Attack / Multirole Fighter"}, {"id": "277d26b8-7b31-4bb0-b358-bf51cc7e92f0", "year_model": "1984", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Beriev A-50 (NATO codename: 'Mainstay') serves the modern Russian Air Force in the Airborne and Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) role - commonly recognized in U.S. speak as 'AWACS'. The framework is that of the Soviet Ilyushin IL-76 'Candid' transport aircraft of the Cold War period with modifications completed by the Beriev concern to produce a new aircraft for the AWACS role. The most distinguishing feature of the A-50 series is its radome which sits over the rear dorsal section of the fuselage. Service introduction of the aircraft occurred in 1984 and production spanned from 1978 to 1992 to which some forty examples were completed. The A-50 remains in active service (though in modernized forms) with the Russian Air Force as well as the Indian Air Force - the only two global operators of the type.\n\r\nThe A-50 was developed as a successor to the aging Tupolev Tu-126 ('Moss') aircraft line which first appeared in 1962 (service entry followed in 1965). The Tu-126 was converted from the Tu-114 commercial airliner and became the Soviet Union's first AEW platform. In 1971, a prototype Ilyushin IL-76 recorded its first-flight and saw introduction in 1974 with nearly 1,000 units made over the life of its production run. This aircraft proved a multirole performer for the Soviet Empire and thus was selected by authorities for conversion to the AWACS role in the late 1960s with work continuing into the early-to-mid 1980s.\n\r\nA first-flight of an A-50 prototype was had on December 19th, 1978 and twenty-four examples were delivered for service in 1984.\n\r\nBeyond the obvious external structural additions, the internal landscape of the transport was reworked to take on crew stations with the total crew complement numbering fifteen. The 'Liana' surveillance radar system was fitted as a suspended saucer-like structure over the rear of the fuselage and this powerful system allowed for target tracking out to 650 kilometers for aerial threats (300 km otherwise). The radar was to assist in both intercept and ground-attack missions as well as provide valuable battlefield surveillance and air traffic control.\n\r\nThe aircraft sports dimensions that include a length of 152.7 feet, a wingspan of 165.5 feet and a height of 48.4 feet. Empty weight is 165,400lb against an MTOW of 365,000lb. Power is from 4 x Soloviev D-30KP turbofan engines developing 26,500lb of thrust each, providing speeds nearing 560 miles per hour and ranges out to 4,000 miles (a built-in air refueling capability is seen in modernized forms for extended operational ranges). The aircraft's service ceiling is approximately 40,000 feet.\n\r\nWhile A-50 marks the standard initial production forms, several modernized variants have emerged since including the A-50M and A-50U. The M-model adds the aforementioned in-flight refueling capability and the U-model of 1995 features extensive updates to its equipment (primarily the Vega-M radar fit, giving simultaneous tracking of 50 targets out to 125 nautical miles) replacing original first-run models in service. The Indian Air force operates the A-50E/I variant which includes Israeli EL/W-2090 series radar as well as Aviadvigatel PS-90 A-76 series turbofan engines, the same as fitted to the Ilyushin IL-76 family as well as the Tupolev Tu-204 narrow-body airliner and Ilyushin IL-96 wide-body airliner breeds.\n\r\nThe A-50I was a planned variant for the Chinese Air Force to be outfitted with Israeli radar but pressure put on the Israelis by the Americans forced the cancellation of this design.\n\r\nSeveral 'one-off' aircraft have also been developed: Izdeliye-676 and Izdeliye-776 both were designed along the lines of 'telemetry and tracking' platforms. Izdeliye-976 (SKIP) was added as a cruise missile support vehicle (serving missile tracking). Izdeliye-1076 became a 'special mission' aircraft.\n\r\nThe Russian Air Force has about 22 x A-50M models currently (2017) in service with another 4 x A-50U on hand. The Indian Air Force maintains a stable of five and these serve with No.50 Squadron out of Agra Air Force Station in north-central India.\n\r\nThe A-50 has been identified through satellite imagery as actively deployed in Syria during the ongoing Syrian Civil War (2011-Present) which includes Russian involvement on the side of the Assad regime.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Beriev A-50 (Mainstay)", "aircraft_type": "Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) Aircraft"}, {"id": "6633b2d1-e96b-49af-89ef-7ec0666fc7e2", "year_model": "1984", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet / Russian military has received a great number of years of faithful service from its Ilyushin IL-76 line (NATO codename of \"Candid\") of four-engined jet aircraft. The series first flew in 1971 and was debuted in June of 1974 as a strategic airlifter to help Soviet forces support its interests around the world. Some 960 airframes were eventually completed with many exported to allies and former states - some servicing the civilian market as jetliners and others modernized into more capable military forms. In the 1970s, thought was given to modifying the type for service in the aerial refueling role as a tanker aircraft and this produced the IL-78 \"Midas\" of 1984. First flight was on June 26th, 1983. The type remains in service and production is ongoing today (2014) with 53 total units completed.\n\r\nThe IL-78 has its roots in a late-1960s initiative by the Soviets to produce a tanker offshoot of the IL-76 line but the bulk of the work to bring the new system to pass happened in the late 1970s thanks to evermore evolved forms of the IL-76 airframe that emerged. The IL-76 lost its cargo-hauling and management hardware during the conversion process  and was fitted with three refueling positions to service three awaiting/trailing aircraft at once. The aircraft utilized the proven three-point \"hose-and-drogue\" delivery system with a fuel dispensing position found under each wing and one under the tail. Trials were undertaken in 1977 through a converted IL-76MD airframe and this testing led to certification trials thereafter, spanning into the early 1980s. First deliveries were in 1984 and official service began in 1987 - replacing the outgoing stock of Mya-4 \"Bison\" tankers. The crew numbered seven with the rear tail gun position of the IL-76 replaced by an observer's perch. Additionally, ranging radar was installed as were formation lights at the cargo door ramp so as to be visible by the approaching recipient aircraft - particular in night time refueling exercises.\n\r\nOn the whole, the IL-78 retains much of the form of the classic Soviet IL-76. It features the large, high-mounted main wing assemblies each holding with two underslung engine nacelles. The flight deck is over the nose with a commanding view of the environment ahead and around the massive aircraft. The fuselage is very tubular and aerodynamically efficient with few protrusions apparent. The tail unit constitutes a single vertical tail fin with high-mounted horizontal planes in a \"T-style\" arrangement. The undercarriage is wheeled and fully retractable with a two-wheeled nose leg and multi-wheeled main legs under the mass of the airframe.\n\r\nOriginal production versions were known simply as \"IL-78\" and these carried up to 188,540lbs of fuel through two removable tanks held in the fuselage. The IL-78T was similar in scope though it kept the cargo-hauling capabilities of the original IL-76 freighter. The IL-78M of 1987 became the first true dedicated tanker form as it carried three large fuel stores in a fixed arrangement. The cargo door was removed (though the ramp was retained) as was the cargo management equipment. Carried fuel loads now reached over 300,000lbs. The export version of this mark became the IL-78ME. The IL-78MKI was a version delivered to the Indian Air Force (IAF) and were airframes completed in Uzbekistan with Israeli-based fuel transfer system and applicable equipment. The Chinese and Pakistani air forces received the IL-78MP which were tanker forms (removable fuel tanks) retaining some of their cargo-hauling and cargo management capabilities. Beyond these operators, the IL-78 has been taken on in limited numbers by the forces of Algeria and Libya. Ukraine also operates up to eight of the type. Furthermore, some IL-78 aircraft are operated privately by American companies overseas.\n\r\nPerformance from IL-78M models includes a maximum speed of 530 miles per hour with a range out to 4,535 miles. The aircraft sports a service ceiling of 39,350 feet. Power is through 4 x Aviadvigatel (Soloviev) D-30 KP series turbofan engines of 26,700lbs thrust each. Variations of this engine were featured in the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31\"Foxhound\" interceptor, the Ilyushin IL-62 \"Classic\" airliner, and the Tupolev Tu-154 \"Careless\" airliner.\n\r\nFrom March to April 2014, the Chinese Air Force acquired three IL-78MDs to help improve its long-range strategic ability. This initiative also falls in line with the long-term development of an indigenous strategic bomber currently on the drawing board for the PLA. The IL-78MDs were modified in Ukraine with Russian equipment. The PLA also relies on a fleet of twenty-six H-6U tanker aircraft - aerial refueling versions of the local Xian H-6 strategic bomber. The bomber itself is based on the Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 bomber of the early 1950s.\n\r\nThe IL-78M-90A is an all-modern, in-development version of the IL-78 series. It began flight testing in December 2018 and includes such upgrades as an all new wing with additional fuel cells and Perm PS-90A-76 series engines (as in the IL-76-90A transports). The engines will grant better fuel efficiency as well as greater power leading to improved performance specs (MTOW, take-off run, etc...).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-78 (Midas)", "aircraft_type": "In-Flight Refueling Tanker Aircraft"}, {"id": "c5791c0e-f18c-44fd-bc1d-dbcf649c94c3", "year_model": "1984", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" did much to further Soviet/Russian aviation technology and, along with the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\", formed a powerful and highly-capable one-two punch for the Soviet Air Force and its allies through the 1990s and the new millennium. The potency of the MiG-29 has since grown over the decades thanks to programs that have evolved the system from a deadly lightweight fighter to a potent, multi-faceted tool of warfare. The MiG-29 has proven a success worldwide with operators beyond the Soviet Union/Russia being Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czech Republic, Eritrea, Hungary, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Peru, North Korea, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Yemen. East German/German MiG-29s were eventually sold to Poland. Iraq no longer fields the Fulcrum while Romania has since retired her small fleet. Israel procured at least one example for aggressor training considering its most potent ally in the region would have been Russian-made MiG-29s. Yugoslavia is a former operator and these later fell into Serbian use during the Serb-Croat War. \n\r\nToday, Russia maintains some 445 MiG-29s in inventory as of early 2011. India also currently manages several dozen MiG-29s for its air force and navy air arms making it one of the primary export operators of the aircraft. North Korea operates at least 40 Fulcrums which were purchased from both Russia and Belarus. In 1997, even the United States purchased 21 Fulcrums from Moldova in an attempt to keep these Russian fighters from falling into rogue hands - giving American engineers unprecedented access to this fine fighter. Several of these MiG-29s went on to become museum displays across America. While an excellent proven fighter platform over the years, the MiG-29 has had her share of notable and much-publicized crashes, some resulting in fatalities. Nevertheless, her potency today is a far cry from what she was at inception and programs have brought about the best in her base design.\n\r\nBy the end of the 1960s, both the East and West were well on their way towards development of Fourth Generation jet-powered fighters. Fourth Generation jet fighters originated in the 1970s and introduced a myriad of new features to make for more capable, ever more lethal fighter mounts. The United States went on to introduce the venerable McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle in 1976 and the fleet was further strengthened by the arrival of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1978. The long-standing McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was still a fixture worldwide and since 1974 the Grumman F-14 Tomcat interceptor would patrol the skies wherever American carriers were. On the other side of the world, the Soviet Union was holding ground with their fabled MiG-21 \"Fishbed\" fighter of 1959 and the Sukhoi Su-15 \"Flagon\" of 1967. However, the Mikoyan concern also unveil their MiG-23 \"Flogger\" in 1970 which was then evolved into a capable ground-attack platform in the MiG-27. To counter new American and NATO developments, Mikoyan OKB was one of three Soviet firms tabbed with beginning work on a new Fourth Generation mount in 1970 - the other two being stalwart competitors Sukhoi and Yakovlev. Mikoyan-Gurevich became a household name in the dark days of World War 2, responding with the excellent single-seat, piston-powered MiG-1 fighter aircraft to match wits with German Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s.\n\r\nIn 1974, Soviet authorities detailed a requirement for a new lightweight fighter with excellent agility to replace the MiG-21, MiG-23 and Su-15 series along the Cold War frontlines. By this time, technology made it such that the new fighter aircraft could be fitted with increased digital processing and utilize the latest in missile weaponry as well as radar systems. The new development would be powered by equally-new engines and field an array of short- and medium-range air-to-air missiles as well as an internal cannon for close-in work. The fighter would be charged with direct competition against the best that West had to offer.\n\r\nMikoyan engineers set to work on the new requirement and, based on past operational experience of previous jet aircraft to their name, settled on a two-engine design layout from the standpoint that it offered up inherent benefits - not the least of these being better performance and basic crew survivability. The new fighter was christened the \"MiG-29\" and its early design forms presented an aircraft design not unlike the boxy Mikoyan MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" - a large, flat-bodied interceptor built primarily for speed and utilized to intercept aerial threats with missiles and radar. The new design featured a forward-set cockpit with a raise fuselage spine, twin engines buried in the fuselage side-by-side and high-mounted wing assemblies with an elegantly contoured wing leading edge. Engine exhaust rings were straddled by rearward-extending booms mounting the twin vertical tail fin assembly. The engines were aspirated by a large pair of rectangular intakes fitted to either side of the forward fuselage. In all respect, the design was nothing more than a glorified MiG-25 in its current form. Other designs then emerged, one even appearing to resemble the upcoming McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and still another seemingly mimicking the design style of the F-15 itself.\n\r\nIn 1971, it was resolved that the program should revolve around two distinct aircraft types based on the same overall airframe, only each were to be modified to suit different mission roles. This produced a dedicated interceptor form fitted with radar and increased fuel and a dedicated multi-faceted tactical fighter to work within shorter ranges and be faster to produce in number. In effect, each design was meant to counter the F-15 and F-16 in their respective primary roles. This approach also ensured commonality of parts across both mounts and improved logistics to an extent while also retaining inherent performance qualities regardless of mission role.\n\r\nOf the three competing Soviet firms, only Mikoyan and Sukhoi's proposals were selected for further development and it was Mikoyan that would eventually prevail - at least in the short term. Mikoyan moved ahead to develop the MiG-29 and the similar MiG-29A and different radar systems were trialed. Both designs also fielded a helmet-mounted sight (HMS). Interestingly, flight controls would be handled by a less complex system utilizing basic linkage mechanics as opposed to \"fly-by-wire\" controls becoming ever more prevalent in Western fighters. On June 26th, 1974, Mikoyan's submission was officially selected ahead of Sukhoi's two attempts and the legacy of the MiG-29 was born.\n\r\nHowever, in a turn of events on January 19th, 1976, Soviet authorities opted to develop a heavier dedicated fighter platform to match the F-15 directly and classified the MiG-29 as a \"lightweight\" fighter design meant to counter the reach of the F-16 directly. This initiative officially gave rise to the development of the much larger and highly-capable Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" series detailed elsewhere on this site. The two aircraft would, therefore, become the next generation mounts to welcome all upcoming Soviet fighter pilots and be fielded in strength side-by-side throughout the 1980s and 1990s while still serving operationally today. Interestingly, both fighters would also represent the first Soviet use of computer controlled avionics which further leveled the playing field between the Soviet Air Force and offerings of the West. New radar would also be developed specifically for these new breeds as would be more lethal air-to-air missiles based on the latest technologies available. The MiG-29 would. therefore, be more of a point defense fighter while the Su-27 would serve in the long-range role.\n\r\nDevelopment of the MiG-29 was no small feat for the Soviet aviation industry that generally lagged behind the West in terms of innovation. The MiG-29 program itself was to be a formidable foray into largely unknown territories and caution was exercised when possible in an effort to produce the very best end-product. Construction of the MiG-29 involved use of aluminum-lithium based alloys as well as composites, both measures to ensure that the airframe met Soviet weight specifications. Automatic flaps and LERXES would figure into the mix to provide for superb control and outstanding agility. Vision out of the cockpit was excellent thanks to a raised position and afforded the pilot a commanding view of the action ahead from all pertinent angles.\n\r\nMikoyan delivered their first of fourteen prototypes in the first \"Aircraft 901\" which more or less mimicked the design lines as found in production-quality MiG-29s to a certain extent. One major difference came in the well-forward positioning of the nose landing gear leg. Western observers were convinced that the new Soviet fighter featured \"swing wing\" (or variable geometry wing) technology to match the F-14 Tomcat, General Dynamics F-111 or the British Panavia Tornado but this was not the case - wings on the MiG-29 prototype were fixed in place and stemmed from a fixed fuselage root extension area - perhaps giving the impression to some of swing wings being used. The cockpit was held well-forward in the design with excellent visibility throughout. Large rectangular intake openings, slightly canted inwards at their top edges, were fitted under the fuselage and straddled the central tubular fuselage nacelle. Engines were low-set in the fuselage with wings shoulder-mounted. There were a pair of vertical tail fins outboard of each engine mount. Wings featured noticeable sweep along the leading edges and lesser sweep along the trailing edge. Horizontal tailplanes were fitted well-aft in the design, extending beyond the reach of the jet exhaust rings. The undercarriage was fully-retractable and of the tricycle arrangement with a pair of single-wheeled main landing gear legs and a double-wheeled nose landing gear. So as to not ingest potentially harmful field debris, the intakes could be sealed, taking in air from the leading edges during startup and taxiing actions. In many ways, the finalized form was not wholly unlike the original MiG-29 vision that borrowed so heavily from the MiG-25 - just excessively streamlined for a new generation of Soviet airman.\n\r\nFirst flight of the MiG-29 prototype was recorded on October 6th, 1977. After early evaluations of the system in flight, the nose landing gear was moved more aft to combat the leg perhaps encouraging the ingesting of debris into the awaiting intake systems for each engine. Direction stability was also improved by the addition of ventral strakes. Controlled spins were enacted by test pilots and it was soon found that the MiG-29's airframe design could actually self-recover our of potentially deadly in-air spins that would doomed most other aircraft. During development, another prototype - Aircraft 908 - was lost to an engine failure during a flight. The production-quality MiG-29 prototype became prototype Aircraft 917 and was noted for its extended rudder bases. Prototype Aircraft 918 then followed and was completed with an intact fire control radar (FCR) system. It was further used in testing of a possible navalized MiG-29 complete with an arrestor hook for carrier landings. Other prototypes followed that included a two-seat conversion trainer and mounts dedicated to the testing of specific onboard systems and components. \n\r\nIn 1979, the US Pentagon received a blurry satellite overhead profile image of what was the actual prototype MiG-29 and, in accordance with past NATO designation standards, afforded the new Soviet model the nickname of \"Fulcrum\". The image was not overly clear and subsequent artist impressions of the aircraft were well-off base and led to much deviation. Once further versions of the aircraft were identified, the primary fighter variant became known to NATO as \"Fulcrum-A\". The MiG-29 was formally introduced into the Soviet Air Force in August of 1983 and operational service was achieved in 1984. The first operating wing became the 234th Proskoorovskiy Fighter Wing. At their peak, some 800 MiG-29s would stock the inventory of the Soviet Union / Russia across 25 different fighter groups. The largest group was naturally stationed in East Germany to showcase the new fighter against its Western counterparts. In 1988, the MiG-29 was demonstrated to audiences at Farnborough, UK. There, pilots entertained crowds with an unprecedented \"tailslide\" maneuver - a feat which, up to this point, had never been accomplished by a combat aircraft.\n\r\nIn 1991, the political climate across Europe saw the end of the Cold War, essentially bringing an end to Soviet rule in the region and an end to the Soviet Empire proper. Russia entered a period of uncertainty and defense funding was drastically cut from what was enjoyed throughout the blank-check \"glory days\" of the Cold War prior. Production of MiG-29s was therefore slowed to the point of near full stoppage. The reunification of Germany allowed Western observers full access to East German MiG-29s for extensive scrutiny.\n\r\nThe original MiG-29 was fitted with a pair of Klimov RD-33 series afterburning turbofan engines delivering up to 18,300lbs of thrust each. This supplied the mount with a top speed in excess of Mach 2.25 (1,490 miles per hour), a service ceiling of nearly 60,000 feet and a range of 888 miles on just internal fuel. Performance was such that the MiG-29 could get airborne and achieve vertical flight within a short amount of time. Standard armament was a 1 x GSh-30-1 internal cannon which could be supplemented with external ordnance across seven hardpoints, six underwing and a fuselage centerline position. Such munition options included air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles and conventional drop bombs as well as external fuel stores and Electronic CounterMeasure (ECM) pods.\n\r\nThe Fulcrum sported excellent maneuverability and could maintain a high angle-of-attack (AoA) at top flight speeds. Agility was equally excellent and low-speed handling a true strength. Targeting was possible through the internal RP-29 pulse-Doppler radar suite that allowed for \"look down, shoot down\" capability - a must for modern aircraft. The pilot's helmet-mounted sight delivered pertinent target information and could be used to guide infrared air-to-air missiles towards a target that were not in the immediate vision arc of the HUD (Heads-Up Display). The integrated IRST system allowed for passive detection and engagement of multiple enemy aircraft. As mentioned above, prevention of debris ingestion into the low-slung intake openings during warm up and taxiing actions was handled by the automatically sealing intake doors. Upon the aircraft beginning to move, the leading edge inlets would give way to the primary intakes.\n\r\nThe MiG-29 was naturally branched out into a two-seat conversion trainer variant and designated by Mikoyan as \"MiG-29UB\". The type first flew on April 28th, 1981 and development involved three prototypes. The major obvious difference in this model was its two-seat, tandem cockpit arrangement with its rear-hinged canopy. To make room for the second cockpit, the production model's fire control radar was omitted but for the most part the MiG-29UB stayed faithful and fully combat-capable and, as such, could be relatively easily converted back into its combat form if need be. Without the radar, however, student pilots could only train for air-to-air missions. Upon identification of this model within NATO, the nickname of \"Fulcrum-B\" was afforded.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG-29 (Fulcrum)", "aircraft_type": "Lightweight Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "9e15f435-c2d1-4b79-9439-872084083794", "year_model": "1984", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-26 is a Soviet-era lightweight, aerobatic racer powered through a single, nose-mounted engine and piloted by a sole crew member. The design appeared through a first-flight in June of 1984 and has been in actively utilized ever since. Related developments include the Sukhoi Su-29 and Su-31 platforms revealed in 1991 and 1992, respectively.\n\r\nThe Su-26 relies on elegant, aerodynamically-efficient streamlining of its airframe, seating the pilot over midships under a large-area windscreen. The nose is long, restricting forward vision from the cockpit and the mainplanes also reduce visibility to the forward-sides of the aircraft. These members are straight in their general shaping with clipped tips and positioned slightly ahead of midships. The dorsal spine is raised and the entire fuselage tapers towards the short tail section which is capped by a single vertical fin and seats a pair of low-mounted horizontal planes. The \"tail-dragger\" undercarriage (with arced, titanium-based main legs) is of a simple lightweight design and remains fixed during flight - further reducing complexity and maintenance commitments.\n\r\nThe aircraft is powered by a single Vedeneyev M14P series 9-cylinder, air-cooled radial piston engine developing 360 horsepower and driving a three-bladed constant-speed propeller unit at the nose. Coupled with its streamlined design, this gives the aircraft a maximum speed of 280 miles-per-hour, a range out to 500 miles, and a service ceiling up to 13,000 feet. Cruising speeds are closer to 185 mph. Rate-of-climb is 3,500 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nSince its inception, the Su-26 has been something of a showstopper with its exceptional performances. It claimed the 1986 World Aerobatics Championships in both men's and women's team categories and also finished first in the 2004 European Championships as well as the 2003 and 2005 Aerobatic World Championships.\n\r\nThe original 1980s form of the aircraft was flown with a simpler two-bladed propeller unit. Since then, the series has seen several notable modified / modernized variants appear: the Su-26M is an offshoot refined throughout and introduced a three-bladed propeller arrangement among other changes.

This heavy-lift series was developed to replace the aging Mil Mi-6 series. The Mi-26 was given an all-new, eight-bladed main rotor driven by a pair of Lotarev powerplants which helped the helicopter become a proven performer in both military and civilian roles - serving well in humanitarian relief efforts through its impactful supply-delivery capabilities.\n\r\nThe Mi-26 is powered by twin Lotarev D-136 series turboshafts developing approximately 11,400 shaft horsepower each and these are installed atop the cargo hold section of the fuselage abaft of the flight deck.

The cargo area is spacious and suitable for hauling up to 90 infantry with gear, 60 medical litters with staff or up 44,100 pounds of cargo. Her power is such that she can be used to carry heavy construction equipment to areas traditional rugged Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft cannot. Entry/exit is through sliding side doors as well as a powered loading ramp at rear which opens at the base of the tail section. The undercarriage is fixed and wheeled, consisting of a traditional tricycle arrangement. The standard operating crew for the Mi-26 is five made up of two pilots, a flight engineer/loadmaster, dedicated navigator, and a flight technician.\n\r\nThe Mi-26 has evolved from its original V-29 prototype to appear in a variety of dedicated and specialized forms. These include modernized models, MEDEVAC versions, a dedicated Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform, passenger/cargo types, and an airborne heavy-lift crane version. There has also been a dedicated fire-fighting platform.\n\r\nBeyond the militarized versions of the Mi-26, there are also civilian market variants in service. Since its inception, it is reported that about 300 Mi-26 helicopters have been produced. First flight was on December 14th, 1977 with service introduction coming in 1983. Deliveries followed thereafter and full operational status was reached by 1986. \n\r\nThe Mi-26 was designed by engineers at the storied Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant in Moscow, Russia.\n\r\nAn Mi-26 Halo, with over 125 Russian personnel aboard, was downed by a Chechen surface-to-air missile system in August of 2002, killing all passengers and crew. More recently, Chinese Mi-26's have taken part in disaster relief operations in quake-effected regions of China.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-26 (Halo)", "aircraft_type": "Heavy-Lift Transport Helicopter"}, {"id": "b886e23f-e9ba-460d-aff3-9462315eed5a", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kamov Ka-27 Helix naval helicopter was developed as a direct successor to the aging Kamov Ka-25 line in service with the Soviet Navy - both were primarily used to fulfill the Anti-Ship (AS) role but were eventually branched out to undertake other roles as needed including Search and Rescue (SAR), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and general over-water transport to serve Soviet Navy ships. As seen in previous Kamov helicopter designs, the Ka-27 did not showcase a conventional tail rotor but was instead driven through two counter-rotating, three-bladed main rotors, one seated atop the other - this action counteracted the torque generated by one rotor assembly over the other.\n\r\nThe Ka-27 shares the same overall dimensions as its Ka-25 predecessor which means that very little in the way of onboard ship storage was revised to accommodate the Ka-27 upon acceptance into the Soviet Navy role. The Helix was crewed by three standard operating personnel that included the pilot, a \"tactical coordinator\", and an Anti-Surface Weapons Coordinator. There was also seating for up to sixteen passengers which lent the Ka-27 Helix well for the transport role when the interior is equipped as such (Ka-29TB).\n\r\nThe Ka-27 saw a first flight on December 24th, 1973 and was formally introduced during 1982 and some 267 examples were ultimately realized. These went on to serve both Soviet and Russian navies as well as the Ukrainian and Indian navies overseas. One of the Ka-27s offshoots became the modern Ka-31 which arrived in 1995 and serves in the Airborne Early Warning (AEW) role.\n\r\nVariants of the Ka-27 were led by the Ka-25-2 prototype. The Ka-27K served as the ASW prototype which produced the Ka-27PL (\"Helix-A\") ASW production model. The Ka-27PS (\"Helix-D\") became a dedicated SAR model and the Ka-27PV was its armed form. The PL was exported as the Ka-28. The Ka-29TB was developed as an assault transport with seating for sixteen passengers. A civilian market form became the Ka-32 and various sub-variants of this mark were later released.\n\r\nMilitary operators (beyond the Soviet Union/Russia) of the Ka-27 have gone on to include Algeria, China, India, Portugal, Syria, Ukraine, Vietnam, South Korea, and the former Yugoslavia. Civilian operators have been recognized in Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, and Portugal.\n\r\nThe base Ka-27 is powered by 2 x Isotov TV3-117V turboshaft engines delivering 2,230 horsepower each. Performance includes a maximum speed of 170 miles per hour, a cruising speed in the 130 mph range, a service range of 610 miles, and a service ceiling of up to 16,400 feet.\n\r\nTypical armament has been 1 x torpedo while the helicopter can also dispense depth charges and sonobouys as required.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kamov Ka-27 (Helix)", "aircraft_type": "Anti-Ship / Multi-role Naval Helicopter"}, {"id": "508db302-d69d-4725-a782-9020ca7f3ce9", "year_model": "1982", "description": "Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) - West Germany / Kawasaki - Japan", "aircraft_name": "MBB-Kawasaki BK 117", "aircraft_type": "Light Utility Helicopter (LUH)"}, {"id": "979276b8-30bc-47f9-ac28-64a716321c72", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tupolev Tu-143 (Reys) was developed as a dimensionally-smaller, low-to-medium-altitude, short-ranged version of the preceding Tu-141 reconnaissance drone (detailed elsewhere on this site) by the Soviet Union's Tupolev OKB concern. The newer version achieved its first-flight in 1970 and was brought online in 1976 - though not officially introduced into service until 1982. The series - of which some 950 were eventually produced - went on to stock the inventories of the usual Soviet-allied players of the time including Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia (eventually passed on to Slovakia), Iraq, Romania, and Slovakia. \n\r\nDespite its Cold War-era origins, the Tu-143 still manages to serve with the powers of Belarus, North Korea, Russia (reserved as aerial targets), Syria, and Ukraine today (2022) though it is considered an obsolete design as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) go.\n\r\nBorrowing design lines from the earlier Tu-141, the Tu-143 was essentially \"missile-like\" in its general appearance with the exception of a turbojet engine seated over the aft section of the fuselage dorsal line. Mainplanes were added low, and to the sides, of the aft-section of the fuselage while small canard-like foreplanes are set along the sides of the fuselage aft of the nose. The nosecone was capped by a noticeable a probe protrusion. As the aircraft lacked a conventional undercarriage, a launch vehicle (encompassing the Tu-143's own transport tube) was used in the take-off process which also involved Jet-Assisted Take-Off (JATO) from the launch rail (the booster pack seated under the aft-section of the fuselage) with recovery handled by parachute deployed at mission's end.\n\r\nDimensionally, the T-143 was given an overall length of 26.4 feet, a wingspan of 7.3 feet, and a height of 5 feet. Its launch weight reached 2,710lb and power form the single Klimov TR3-117 turbojet of 1,300lb thrust provided the vehicle with a maximum speed of 590 miles-per-hour. The vehicle's rated service ceiling was 16,500 feet and its range was 125 miles.\n\r\nSeveral notable variants in the Tu-143 family line ultimately emerged beginning with the M-143 of 1983 which was a dedicated target drone. The Tu-243, first flying in 1987, was then offered in 1999 as an improved version for reconnaissance work: its fuselage was lengthened by 10 inches to accommodate additional fuel storage to enhanced operational ranges while the internal guidance system was improved and a more powerful Klimov TR3-117 series engine outputting 1,410 lb thrust was installed.\n\r\nFrom this work came the announcement that an all-new, more powerful model was in development, the Tu-300 \"Korshun\". This offering was to provide much-needed support for more modern sensors and feature munitions-delivery support. With the fall of the Soviet Empire in the late-1980s / early-1990s, this project struggled to gain footing and was not revitalized until 2007 - though its current development status is unknown.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-143 (Reys / Flight)", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance Drone"}, {"id": "ab24e0e6-27a1-4e56-8444-dbf8aaa9d3bd", "year_model": "1981", "description": "\r\n        \tThe original Mil Mi-8 \"Hip\" medium-lift transport helicopter series first flew in prototype form on July 7th, 1961 and was introduced in 1967. Since then, over 17,000 examples of the type have been produced while the series maintains an active presence within the inventories of many air services today (2015). The Mi-17 \"Hip\" model - based on the Mi-8M/MT variant of the Soviet/Russian military - was developed with exportation in mind and has been adopted by over twenty nations worldwide. The Mi-17 model achieved its own first flight in 1975 and was introduced in 1981. Notable serial production has been ongoing since 1977 with totals reaching around 12,000 units with production shared between the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant as well as the Kazan Helicopter Plant.\n\r\nExternally, the Mi-17 product shares many of the same features with its earlier cousin including a well-glazed cockpit offering good vision, sliding side doors access with rear loading ramp, and fixed wheeled tricycle undercarriage. One discernable difference is in the tail rotor mounting which now faces starboard instead of port side. The cockpit area has been given improved protection through additional armoring and larger Klimov TV3-117VM turboshaft engines have increased performance - the main rotor and gearbox are based on those developed for the Mi-14.\n\r\nBeyond its traditional role of personnel/cargo hauler, the Mi-17 can be outfitted for the gunship role, typically through multi-shot rocket pods fitted along wing stub mountings. Other versions have been equipped for Search and Rescue (SAR), VIP/general passenger transport, high-altitude, MEDEVAC, Electronic Warfare (EW), and airborne Command Post (CP) service. It has seen its fair share of operations over active combat zones ranging from Cambodia and India/Pakistan to Columbia, Macedonia, and Sri Lanka. Mi-17s were used by both sides of the Libyan Civil War (2011) and the rebuilding Afghan Air Force relies heavily on its Mi-17 fleet.\n\r\nOperators currently range from Afghanistan and Argentina to Sri Lanka and Thailand. China began local license production of the Mi-17 during May of 2008 and, despite its Cold War-era roots, the Mi-17 remains very much in play today with several nations still considering order of the type.\n\r\nThe base designation of the line is Mi-17 and it is known to NATO as \"Hip-H\". The Mi-8AMT based model is the Mi-17-1 for export. The Mi-17-1M is its high-altitude performance equivalent. The Mi-17-1VA serves in the airborne hospital role while the Mi-17-2 is the Mi-8MTV-2. The Mi-8MTV-3 becomes the Mi-17V-3 and the Mi-8MTV-5 is the Mi-17V-5. The Mi-17V-7 is outfitted with VK-2500 engines and its loading ramp has been replaced by clam shell-style doors. The Mi-17M was a test bed for what became the Mi-17MD (Mi-17V-5). New avionics greeted the Mi-7KF. Night operations support was brought to the Mi-17N. General passenger hauling service was through the Mi-17P variant. The Mi-8MTG became the export Mi-17PG. The Mi-17S serves as a VIP passenger model.

This has included regular Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) types as well as armed, munitions-delivery Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) platforms. The Ghods \"Mohajer\" (also spelled as \"Mahajer\") represents one of the former as it primarily serves as an intelligence-collecting system. It has been taken on by the forces of Iran, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela (the Mohajer-2 locally-produced as the SANZT \"Arpia\") as well as Hezbollah forces. Four major variants mark its production and service run to date with subvariants being developed as well.\n\r\nThe need for an ISR system came about during the bloody Iran-Iraq conflict of the 1980s which pushed Iranian industry to develop a local solution for its Army. This resulted in a collection of prototypes emerging in the early part of the decade to which operational forms were then used in actual war zones between the two neighboring countries. The original series was named \"Mohajer-1\" and began the line of Mohajer UAVs still in service today (2016). Beyond its use as a ISR platform, it is said that some models operated in the conflict were, in fact, armed with rockets for assailing ground targets - in essence evolving the Mohajer into a UCAV with broader tactical usefulness.\n\r\nFrom this work came a more advanced form offering greater operational range and improved navigation. The model was designated as \"Mohajer-2\" and took over production for use in the Iranian Army. As built, the Mohajer-2 was given a length of 9.6 feet and a wingspan of 12.5 feet. Its propulsion system consisted of a WAE-342 series 2-stroke engine delivering 25 horsepower while driving a two-bladed propeller in a \"pusher\" configuration (the propeller seated at the rear of the airframe). The fuselage was largely tubular in its general shape with straight wing mainplanes seated near midships (displaying clipped wing tips as well). Twin booms made up the empennage and a joining horizontal plane was featured between each vertical tail unit. Optics were fitted to a rotating blister assembly seen under the nose of the aircraft. Performance included a maximum speed of over 100 miles per hour, a range out to 90 miles and a service ceiling up to 11,000 feet. Endurance is about six hours of flight time.\n\r\nAdditional advancements to the line inevitably produced the \"Mohajer-3\" which further increased range and over-battlefield capabilities. Still further work begat an even more advanced version - this becoming the \"Mohajer-4\" - which, itself, has gone on to produce a pair of subvariants all its own. While retaining the general form and function of the Mohajer-2 line, the Mohajer-4 sports a boxier fuselage and three-legged undercarriage. The wing mainplanes also showcase wingtips cranked upwards.\n\r\nThe Mojaher series adds quite a bit to Iranian (and allied) actions in a region consistently beset by war and tribal/political struggles. Its evolution continues today (2016) and evermore improved versions are being worked on and tested. The line has certainly gone a long way in helping to propel local aero-industry to produce a self-sustained Iranian UAV industry. The series is also known under the \"Mersad\" (\"Migrant\") name.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Qods Mohajer / Mersad (Migrant)", "aircraft_type": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) / Reconnaissance Drone"}, {"id": "400fc051-7544-4f8c-9bfd-c8e9a5899fd7", "year_model": "1981", "description": "\r\n        \tSince the early 1980s, the Sukhoi Su-25 (NATO codename of \"Frogfoot\") has served the close-support air strike interests of the Soviet/Russian Air Force as well as the air forces of several nations around the world (primarily Soviet-allied countries or ex-Soviet states). The type has acquitted itself quite well through a plethora of combat exercises during her lengthy operational career. At her core, the Su-25 is  design comparable in battlefield role to the equally-storied Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack platform of the United States Air Force. Despite its decades-old origin, the Su-25 continues in a frontline operational role today (2012) and has been consistently - and adequately - modernized for the rigors and dangers of the modern battlefield. With her supporters still in place, the Su-25 should continue to bring a decade or more of faithful service for the near future as the horizon still lacks a viable replacement.\n\r\nThe Cold War spanned from the late 1940s into the late 1980s and covered a tension-filled portion of modern world history. The line was essentially drawn between the West - led by the United States and her European allies - and the East - headed by the Soviet Empire born from the upheaval of World War 1. The Soviet Union became a powerful military force during World War 2 thanks largely in part to Adolf Hitler's decision to invade the East, his forces finally being stalled by stretched supply lines and the Russian Winter within view of Moscow proper. The Soviet response was massive and brutal as manpower and machine were relocated through all manner of methods, eventually driving the German invaders back into Germany to which then the capital of Berlin was eventually claimed by the Soviet Army through bloody street-to-street fighting.\n\r\nThe events of World War 2 revealed a redesigned Europe where new nations  rose and old ones fell - many guided under various spheres of influence. The differences in ideology politics between East and West would eventually come to a head and, as it was appropriately believed that, the next large-scale war would be witnessed across Europe once again, this time involving thousands of modernized tanks and armored vehicles coupled with massive artillery barrages and air support. Additionally, nuclear weapons would come into play - both on the large scale and on the smaller, portable scale. \n\r\nAs such, both sides began development of dedicated anti-armor measures - heavily-armored and armed tanks, anti-tank missiles, field guns and aircraft. For the latter requirement, the Americans turned to Fairchild Republic which ended up producing the excellent A-10 Thunderbolt II, a twin-engined, jet-powered aircraft armed with a massive 30mm nose-mounted Gatling gun designed specifically to defeat Soviet armor from above. Additionally, the straight-winged nature of the vehicle promoted multiple weapon stations for fitting air-to-surface, armor-defeating guided missiles, rocket pods and drop bombs. The A-10 was a very well-armed machine and extensively armored for the low-level attack role with engines mounted in individual nacelles high above the fuselage to increase survivability. First flight was on May 10th, 1972 to which introduction of the system was finally granted in March of 1977. The United States Air Force became the primary (and sole) handler of the machine.\n\r\nThe Soviet response was similar in scope - a largely conventional, straight-winged design to be powered by turbojet engines and capable of delivering a broad array of munitions. Design was charged to the Sukhoi concern which had already totaled decades of experience in developing viable jet-powered aircraft for the Soviet Air Force (the other well-known Soviet concern being Mikoyan). The new requirement was written for an armored, ground-attack-minded aircraft intended to support ground forces in a combined arms initiative - particularly where enemy armor was in play. Key to the design would be its field survivability and weapons delivery while all other qualities could be deemed somewhat secondary in nature (primarily speed and agility).\n\r\nDevelopment of what would become the \"Su-25\" could be traced back to 1968 following various design studies culminating in the T-8-0 testbed. A working prototype did not officially fly until February 22nd, 1975 when the \"T-8-1\" pilot vehicle was sent airborne for the first time. The aircraft was outfitted with a pair of Tumansky RD-9B turbojet engines and further review led to many inevitable revisions to the product. The T-8-2 became the second true prototype while the T-8-2D mimicked much of what became the finalized Su-25 pre-production design. T-8-3 served as a developmental model. The first Soviet Air Force group stocking the new Su-25 was made operational in 1981 to which NATO recognized the aircraft as the \"Frogfoot\". Production of the Su-25 began in 1978 out of Factory 31 of Tbilisi, Georgia (then under the Soviet sphere).\n\r\nThe Su-25 was completed with a rather basic design approach. The cockpit was set to the front-end of the fuselage in the traditional sense with a clear canopy bordered by large window framing. The sole pilot sat in an titanium-armored \"tub\" that offered maximum protection from ground-based small arms and cannon fire. The aircraft was given a short, pointed nose-cone assembly and a rather stunted fuselage running length. The engines were mounted along the sides of the fuselage as opposed to a side-by-side internal arrangement so as to space them well apart, decreasing the likelihood of a dual-engine flameout or power loss resulting from a direct hit. The engines were aspirated by rounded-rectangular, side-mounted intakes aft of the cockpit and exhausted through circular openings along the sides of the empennage. base The empennage itself was traditional, consisting of a single vertical tail fin, a pair of horizontal tailplanes and a short \"stinger\" protruding from the base of the rudder. Wings were largely straight appendages in their overall design, exhibiting sweep only along the leading edge while being left mainly straight at the trailing edge. These assemblies would be called on to support all manner of munition options across multiple underwing hardpoints. Interestingly, the Su-25 utilized a unique wing-tip-mounted airbrake system that consisted of an upper and lower panel section hinged at the front of the wing. when actuated, the panels sprung open to quickly decrease the speed of the aircraft as required. The aircraft's engines were also a unique quality of the design in that they could be fed with standard aviation fuel as well as diesel, gasoline and kerosene in extreme circumstances. As the aircraft would also be called upon to operate from rough airfields, it proved good foresight to include external maintenance equipment pods which the Su-25 could carry from base-to-base on its own. As such, maintenance could be conducted on the aircraft without a full service outfit being present. The undercarriage was made up of two single-wheeled main landing gear legs and a single-wheeled nose leg, all retractable into the design to complete the aerodynamically refined shape of the aircraft.\n\r\nThe Su-25 featured a standard fixed armament of 1 x 30mm GSh-30-2 internal cannon supported through 250 rounds of ammunition. The underwing and underfuselage stations amounted 11 total hardpoints for the carrying of up to 9,700lbs of external ordnance. Munition options included short-range air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs, rocket pods, gun pods, guided air-to-surface missiles, cluster bombs and conventional drop bombs. At least two hardpoints are plumbed for external fuel stores.\n\r\nThe Su-25 saw extensive combat service in the Soviet involvement of in Afghanistan where their close-support functions could be put through their paces. Operational service in the theater led to beneficial upgrades and modifications of the base Su-25 which improved the type on the whole. As the Mujahedeen began relying more on American shoulder-launched Stinger surface-to-air missiles, the Su-25 was given dedicated survival measures such as IR suppressors over the engine exhaust rings and onboard chaff/flare dispensers to help scramble ground-based radar tracking and homing missile signals. The first Su-25s arrived in the theater in May of 1981 and, in all, some 50 Su-25 aircraft would be deployed during the war. The aircraft ultimately gave a good account of themselves while surviving heavy sortie loads for several years. Lack of progress in the conflict eventually led to a Soviet withdrawal in 1989 after nine years of bloody struggle.\n\r\nThe Su-25 went on to find many suitors in the war-minded world. Operators beyond the Soviet Union/Russia included Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Chad, Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Gambia, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, North Korea, Peru, Slovakia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n\r\nIran and Iraq fought one of the bloodiest wars of the 1980s through the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988. Iraq invaded Iran under the pretenses of upholding Islam and utilized its recently received stock of Soviet Su-25s by the end of the conflict. Several hundred sorties were handled by Iraqi Air Force aircraft in attacks against Iranian positions with one Su-25 credited lost to Iranian air defenses. Ironically, during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, at least seven Su-25s escaped coalition air strikes to Iran and were confiscated by Iranian authorities. Two additional Su-25s were lost to coalition fighters after being engaged by superior F-15 Eagles.\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991, the Russian Air Force retained the services of the Su-25, particularly during the tough years following shrinking defense budgets. This proved important for the aircraft line during the Russian wars of the new decade. Chechnya had proven a thorn in the side of of Russian authorities for quite some time due to the ongoing actions of separatists and this culminated in the \"First Chechen War\" of 1994, a conflict that would last until 1996. Su-25s were brought to bear against seemingly outmatched Chechen forces who utilized an effective guerilla-style ground campaign in turn. While air superiority was achieved by the Russian Air Force, the war ended with a Russian withdrawal of troops in the region and Chechen separatist claimed the victory (aided by foreign fighters, primarily Mujahideen). The war had proven very unpopular on the Russian front (which dwindled overall support) while Russian military moral was at a new low (consequences of a fallen superpower). This eventually forced the Russians to call a ceasefire. At least four Su-25 aircraft were lost in the conflict.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-25 Grach (Frogfoot)", "aircraft_type": "Close-Air Support (CAS) / Ground Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "8741c443-bc7a-4774-bc4d-bba89708f10b", "year_model": "1980", "description": "\r\n        \tJust prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the country fielded its first four-engined wide-body jet airliner for short-to-medium routes (something of a competitor to the West's more successful Boeing Model 747 \"Jumbo Jet\"). This product - the relatively short-lived \"IL-86\" - emerged from the storied Soviet aero-concern of Ilyushin and represented a major national accomplishment - despite a prolonged developmental period and production totals reaching just 106 units (1976 to 1991). Despite this, the IL-86 still managed to find some marketplace value, even coming into use with the modern Russian Air Force (four examples under the \"IL-86VKP\" mark). All civilian market IL-86 airliners have been retired since 2011, these having operated with air carriers such as Aeroflot, Donavia, Kras Air, Siberia Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines.\n\r\nThe IL-86 was known to NATO under the name of \"Camber\" and became the foundational airframe for the follow-up Ilyushin IL-96 of 1992 (30 produced). This aircraft is detailed elsewhere on this site.\n\r\nEverything quality of the IL-86 was highly conventional: Its layout incorporated the flightdeck over a short nosecone assembly and the wing mainplanes were set along the lower sides of the tubular fuselage in the usual way. Under each mainplane member were a pair of podded engines. The undercarriage was of a non-conventional arrangement in that three main legs (as opposed to two) were used in conjunction with the twin-wheeled nose leg. The tail unit incorporated a single, large vertical fin with low-mounted horizontal planes.\n\r\nPower to the design came from 4 x Kuznetsov NK-86 turbofan engines outputting 28,665lb of thrust. Typical cruising speeds reached 160 knots with a range out to 1,835 nautical miles and a rate-of-climb equal to 3,000 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe 255,000lb (empty) aircraft was crewed by three or four depending on operator and a flight crew of eleven could be carried. Total passenger seating could reach up to 350 persons while a mixed-class arrangement reduced this number to 320. Beyond its passenger-hauling capabilities, the aircraft could manage up to 565,035 cubic feet of cargo across three individual compartments. The maximum take-off weight was rated up to 460,000lb.\n\r\nThe aircraft became the subject of several championed - but ultimately unrealized - forms including Long-Range (LR) and High-Capacity (HC) versions. Additionally, one proposal was to cover re-engined (RB211-22 series turbofans) IL-86 airliners under the IL-86V designation.\n\r\nFormer operating nations included Armenia, China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine - all former Soviet-era states or allies.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-86 (Camber)", "aircraft_type": "Wide-Body Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "8d98e7a1-3920-4b86-9675-7c80d558da9b", "year_model": "1979", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MiG-31 \"Foxhound\" was developed as an off-shoot of the record-setting MiG-25 \"Foxbat\". The Foxbat was of a fast breed of aircraft, but agile it was not. It was an airframe built simply to intercept incoming aerial threats utilizing its own powerful engines, an equally powerful radar system and long-range missiles to achieve altitude, head over distances at speed and unleash a potent payload against a target. However, the MiG-25 lacked adequate control at low-altitudes, was strictly a high-altitude weapon and relied on ground-based radar for intercepts. The MiG-31, though externally resembling the MiG-25, was essentially an all-new aircraft with more powerful engines, low-altitude lethality and a second crewman in a rear cockpit to specifically manage the expanded radar suite. Despite its 1980s lineage, the Colds War-era MiG-31 \"Foxhound\" remains in service today and still maintains the title for heaviest operational interceptor anywhere in the world, weighing in at some 61.7 tons.\n\r\nThe original MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" was developed in response to the North American XB-70 Valkyrie jet-powered, strategic bomber program ongoing in the United States. While the XB-70 was eventually cancelled amid ballooning project costs and the advent of intercontinental ballistic missile technology, MiG-25 development had proceeded to the point that production of the new interceptor was a certainty. By the time it joined active frontline Soviet forces, the \"Foxbat\" had already proven itself as a record-setting airframe, capable of Mach 3.0 speeds and fitting a capable radar coupled with the largest air-to-air missiles ever mounted on a military aircraft. This made the MiG-25 one complete and, ultimately, deadly interceptor worthy of note in the West. The MiG-25 appeared at a time in Soviet history when its air defense network had begun showing its age and the West was in development of far more technologically superior weaponry. The Foxbat helped to shore up several lacking elements in the umbrella of Soviet air defenses and, along with it, came a major move to upgrade all facets of protection across Soviet airspace. Key ensuing developments became the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" and Antonov An-74 \"Madcap\" AWACS platforms to go along with the preliminary phases of programs that would eventually spawn the excellent Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" and Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" multirole fighters.\n\r\nHowever, the latter pair was not set to begin operational service until sometime in the mid-1980s. For the interim, existing platforms were fitted with evermore capable interception radar and even more potent weaponry. To increase the potency of the existing MiG-25 series, Mikoyan went to work on a newer, longer-range interceptor that could operate in the same vein without the need for ground-based radar. While the Foxbat pressed all of the mission workload on the single pilot, the new aircraft would split the workload between a pilot and a dedicated radar systems officer seated in an aft second cockpit.\n\r\nBeginning with the Ye-155M research prototype, Mikoyan set out to address both the speed and range limitations of their MiG-25. While a Mach 3-capable airframe, the MiG-25 could only reach and sustain such speeds in short spurts with the engines being prone to \"flame outs\" during prolonged activity. Engine life was short - rated at about 150 hours each - and they proved as fuel-hungry as they were powerful, furthermore limiting operational ranges. As such, Foxbat pilots were instructed to operate their engines in the vicinity of Mach 2.8 and regular operation of Foxbats as a whole was generally curtailed. In fact, it was a two-seat Foxbat trainer that would see more flight time than any of her single-seat interceptor/reconnaissance sisters. Additionally, the Foxbat - built purely for performance - inherently exhibited poor handling at low altitudes and lacked much in the way of maneuverability - she was not a \"true\" fighter when compared to the agile offerings of the West and never designed as such.\n\r\nA pair of Ye-155M prototypes were selected to undergo a \"two-stage\" process in an effort to achieve a viable end-product. Firstly, the airframes would be used to test the new R-15BF-2-300 series engines which promised increased output - up to 7,250 more pounds of thrust than that as fielded on the production MiG-25 - thusly increasing performance specifications for both speed and operating altitudes. Secondly, the airframe would be revised to compensate for the increases higher operating temperatures naturally found in high-speed, high-level flight envelopes. However, since engine testing went over the intended developmental timeline, this forced the second stage of development to be scrapped.\n\r\nWhile never fully accomplishing the intended project goals, the two experimental Ye-155M airframes - now designated Ye-155MP - were reconstituted as test airframes and refitted to evaluate the new Soloviev D-30F6 turbojet engines of 34,170lb thrust. To help facilitate flight at high speed in all altitudes, the body construction of the Ye-155MP was revised in make-up to become 50% nickel steel, 33% aluminum light alloys and 16% titanium (the MiG-25s makeup was 80%, 11% and 9% respectively). In all actuality, the Ye-155MP was expected to enter service as another variant of the MiG-25 line (to become the MiG-25MP). First flight was recorded on September 16th, 1975. Its all-new radar facility was developed in parallel and provided the aircraft with \"eyes\" to look above, below and behind the aircraft's relative position while being able to track up to ten targets at 124 miles distance. The radar allowed for engagement of the top four threats simultaneously.\n\r\nTrials of the prototype ensued and delivered several issues for the Mikoyan design team to overcome. Engine intakes were revised over that as found on the MiG-25 to aspirate the complex and fuel-hungry pairing of engines buried deep within the boxy fuselage. The airbrakes were relocated from their MiG-25 \"shoulder\" positions to under the fuselage intake ducts. Limited range was addressed with the inclusion of an in-flight refueling probe (the Soviets were not as keen to establish in-flight refueling practices as was the West). The fuel probe was installed along the portside of the fuselage and, though not a part of early-production MiG-31s, would become standard fixtures on later series models.\n\r\nThe MiG-31 began series production at the Soviet Gorky Plant in 1979. With the capabilities of the MiG-31 now fully realized by Soviet authorities, the system was quickly dispatched to critical operating areas as the ultimate aerial deterrent. Foxhound crews were now being trained for the intricacies of its two-person response methodology, interception handling and in the in-flight refueling process. The MiG-31 had officially arrived and some 500 production examples were ultimately delivered.\n\r\nIn the early 1970s, the original MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" was a largely unknown beast to the West - rarely photographed and much less known about its true capabilities. Early estimates by the intelligence community believed it to be a fast and agile fighter that eventually forced the development of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle air superiority platform in the United States. However, the Western assumptions of the MiG-25 - in retrospect - was largely incomplete. In September of 1976, all the notions of the MiG-25 finally came to light when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to the West by way of northern Japan. American authorities were eagerly waiting on the ground and quickly took ownership of the MiG-25 and set about rigorously testing the Mikoyan product. Evaluations delivered the system's true inherent strengths and weaknesses and leveled the psychological playing field to an extent.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG-31 (Foxhound)", "aircraft_type": "Long-Range High-Speed Interceptor Aircraft"}, {"id": "a5ba1b03-4e88-4529-8590-539f3a123e84", "year_model": "1979", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tupolev Tu-141 (\"Strizh\" - meaning \"Swift\") is an unmanned / unarmed reconnaissance drone designed, developed, and produced by the Soviet Union during the latter half of the Cold War period (1947-1991). The system recorded its first-flight in 1974 and was formally inducted into Soviet military service in 1979. Production of the series ran from 1979 until 1989 and some 142 are believed to have been manufactured. The fleet was retired by the Soviets in 1989, coinciding with the fall of the Soviet Empire in full. However, Ukraine resurrected some of its outdated fleet in 2014 following the Russian invasion (and subsequent takeover) of Crimea and the ensuing / ongoing War in Donbass.\n\r\nThe Tu-141 has origins in the earlier Tu-123 \"Yastreb\" which went to the air for the first time in 1960, was introduced in 1964, and operated until 1979. Fifty-two of this Tumansky-powered series were built. The Tu-141, itself, went on to form the basis of the Tu-143 \"Reys\" which initially flew with its Klimov engine in 1970 and saw formal series introduction in 1982. Some 950 airframes then followed in production. By all accounts, the trio are rather rudimentary Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with limited battlefield value in modern times.\n\r\nThe Tu-141's basic shape is that of a \"winged\" missile. The fuselage is tubular, capped at the front end by a nosecone for aerodynamic efficiency at high speeds and the turbojet mounting engine sits atop / within the rear section of the fuselage. The mainplanes are of a clipped delta arrangement coupled with foreplane / canards for maximizing control and lift. A vertical plane is affixed to the rear dorsal end of the design. Power is from a single Tumansky KR-17A developing 4,409lb of thrust, the unit aspirated along the dorsal fuselage line and exhausted through a circular port under the airframe's tail section.\n\r\nThe aircraft is launched via a rail system and propelled into flight by a solid-fueled booster. Recovery is by way of parachute that is automatically deployed to retard the air vehicle's fall back down to Earth.\n\r\nThe purpose of the design is that of high-speed, medium-ranged reconnaissance platform utilizing an unmanned approach to keep operators out of harm's way. The speed of such systems means the likelihood of a shoot down is drastically reduced. Payloads generally consist of camera equipment and specialized sensors to suit the battlefield need.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-141 (Strizh)", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance Drone Aircraft"}, {"id": "42e59e4e-6a9a-4911-b804-9543cd79614a", "year_model": "1979", "description": "\r\n        \tIn the latter stages of the Cold War (1947-1991), the Soviet Air Force relied on the Yakovlev Yak-52 to fulfill the primary trainer role. This all-metal aircraft followed conventional design wisdom as primary trainers went, seating its crew of two in tandem (under a framed canopy), showcasing straight monoplane wings, and driven by a propeller at the nose. After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the Yak-52's value to the new Russian Air Force dwindled and stocks of the aircraft witnessed export to former Soviet allies and private buyers. About 1,800 were produced by the Soviets with some license production having been had in Romania (Aerostar). A first-flight was recorded in 1976 and service entry occurred in 1979.\n\r\nThe Yak-52 had origins in the earlier Yak-50 product of 1975. These trainer / aerobatic aircraft appeared in 314 examples of their own and were themselves offspring of the Yak-18 line introduced in 1946. At any rate, all three of the designs shared many similarities in both form and function - they were easy to fly and relatively inexpensive to procure and maintain in the long term - true Soviet design staples. The Yak-52 was designed as a military trainer from the outset which meant greater tolerances had to be adhered to. The benefit was that, when coupled with a lightweight frame, the aircraft could also serve quite well as an aerobatics platform and racer.\n\r\nInitial production yielded the basic \"Yak-52\" mark and these carried a Vedeneyev M-14P series 9-cylinder radial air-cooled radial piston engines of 360 horsepower driving a two-bladed propeller unit at the nose. A ground-attack model was formed from this framework as the \"Yak-52B\" and these could be armed through 2 x UB-32-57 series rocket pods (32 rockets each) for ground target saturation. The Yak-52 series was then modernized with the introduction of the \"Yak-52M\" and this form shifted the family line to using the Vedeneyev M-14Kh radial piston engine now driving a three-bladed propeller unit. In addition to this, the M-models were given upgraded avionics.\n\r\nRomania went on to produce the product (legally, under license) under its Aerostar brand label and these aircraft are designated \"Iak-52\". A \"westernized\" version of the product emerged known under the name of \"Condor\" and it was powered by an American Lycoming O-540 series engine. The \"Iak-52W\", another western-minded variant, is powered by either the M-14P or M-14Kh engine and its cockpit sports western-style gauges. The \"Iak-52TW\" follows suit though with newer wings and extra internal fuel. It also has a tailwheel as opposed to a nosewheel.\n\r\nOperators of the Yak-52 have included Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia (Soviet Union), Ukraine, Turkmenistan and Vietnam. Some of these powers still actively field the type.\n\r\nAs built, the Yak-52 was given a length of 25.4 feet, a wingspan of 30.6 feet and a height of 8.10 feet. Empty weight was 2,240lb against an MTOW of 2,900lb. The M-14P engine provided a maximum speed of 177 mph, a cruise speed of 118 mph and a range out to 340 miles. The aircraft's service ceiling neared 13,125 feet and rate-of-climb was 1,380 feet-per-minute.\r\n\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-52", "aircraft_type": "Primary Trainer / Light Ground Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "2c703ef6-4763-4a78-bc19-94b4ebbb6c5b", "year_model": "1978", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Myasishchev M-55 (NATO codename of \"Mystic\") was originally developed to counter the cold War-eras threat posed by American high-altitude reconnaissance balloons launched into Soviet and Chinese airspace during the 1950s and 1960s. The original program begat the \"Subject 34\" aircraft of which only one was built. This aircraft was eventually evolved along two lines further into its career, resulting in the M-17 \"Stratosphera\" (\"Mystic-A\") \"balloon destroyer\" / reconnaissance platform and the M-55 \"Geophysica (\"Mystic-B\") high-altitude reconnaissance and research platform. Two of the former were produced and five of the latter with the last aircraft arriving in 1994.\n\r\nEnemy balloons could be released in allied airspace by the enemy and drift over Soviet territories. As they were powerless, carried about by the current, there were little, if any, telltale signs of their operation. Unless spotted visibly and intercepted, the balloons could cross the country and deliver critical reconnaissance information. As such, Subject 34 was envisioned with and armament of 2 x 23mm GSh-23 cannons (fitted to a dorsal turret) and provision for 2 x Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs) to engage these targets as a balloon interceptor. However, when the American satellite program improved to the point that these balloons were no longer necessary, there proved little need for evolving the Subject 34 product. At any rate, the prototype was lost in a crash after conducting taxi tests during December of 1978.\n\r\nAnother offshoot of the design was pushed through for the reconnaissance role similar in mission scope to the American Lockheed U-2 spyplane. This aircraft was given a revised airframe and carried a single Rybinsk / Kolesov RD-36-51V series turbojet engine developed from the Tupolev 144 supersonic jet airliner's propulsion unit. A prototype achieved first-flight on May 26th, 1982 and was given the designation of M-17 \"Stratosphera\" in Soviet service. Once acknowledged by the West, the NATO codename became \"Mystic-A\". Besides setting a dozen aircraft records, this design also went on to serve in scientific research roles.\n\r\nM-17 was itself modified to become the \"M-17RN\" high-altitude reconnaissance platform and, later, finalized as the M-55 \"Geophysica\". A first-flight in prototype form occurred on August 16th, 1988 and this fuselage differed in being longer than the original. Additionally, the single engine installation was given up in favor of a twin-engine, side-by-side approach - these being 2 x Soloviev D-30-10V turbofans. The wingspan of the mainplanes was reduced and there was improved support for onboard mission equipment (mainly sensors).\n\r\nAgain the series set about rewriting the aviation record books as the M-55 secured no fewer than fifteen of its own for its time in the air. To better train incoming pilots on the intricacies of this unique aircraft, a tandem two-seat version was also developed as the \"M-55UTS\". Like theM-17 before it, the M-55 went on to conduct scientific work itself and remains in active service as of this writing. A more advanced version was proposed as the \"Geophysica 2\" but not followed up on.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Myasishchev M-55 (Mystic)", "aircraft_type": "High-Altitude Reconnaissance / Scientific Research Aircraft"}, {"id": "9b0770a0-2f5e-4072-ace9-775c02fa7f22", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mikoyan MiG-27 \"Flogger\" was derived from the successful MiG-23 \"Flogger\" interceptor and made into a dedicated ground attack aircraft. The swing-wing capabilities of the original Flogger lent itself well to the low-level activities and short take-off and landings inherent in the close-support role. However, the MiG-27 failed to become as numerous as the MiG-23 before it for other capable Soviet systems (such as the MiG-23 fighter-bomber versions and the adaptable Sukhoi Su-25 \"Frogfoot\") more than made up the same role. As such, production was restricted and the operators list was limited to a few Warsaw Pact nations and some Third World allies. Of note was the license construction/production of the MiG-27 by HAL of India.\n\nAside\n\r\nThe MiG-27 designation was used by the Mikoyan-Gurevich firm some time before, this occurring while trying to fulfill another Soviet requirement for a dedicated low-level close-support aircraft. While this aircraft went on to become the Sukhoi Su-25 \"Frogfoot\", the MiG-27 designation resurfaced again in the dedicated ground-attack version of the MiG-23 interceptor. The MiG-27 retained the same NATO codename of \"Flogger\" as the MiG-23.\n\nDevelopment\n\r\nDevelopment of the Flogger fighter always included provision for making it a dedicated strike version. The original MiG-23 was an interceptor at heart, built on straight-line speed and designed to engage in air-to-air combat with ground strike as a secondary (albeit limited) role. The MiG-23 entered service in the early 1970s and replaced the aging MiG-21 \"Fishbeds\" in their air defense roles. The MiG-21, while fast and capable, suffered from having short range and a limited ordnance capability. The arrival of the MiG-23 remedied that. \n\r\nThough the MiG-23 was converted into a modified fighter-bomber version, it still retained much of its \"fighter\" origins and served as more of an interim design than the vision Soviet authorities had. However, the aircraft was cheap to produce, robust, reliable and - with some modifications - could be made adapted into a more dedicated role. The result was the MiG-23BM \"Experimental\" which ultimately became the MiG-27 \"Flogger\".\n\r\nThe new MiG-27 proved a promising endeavor that the type was put into production straight from the drawing boards. First flight was achieved in 1972. The first available examples were shipped to Soviet air groups based in Germany as a show of force against NATO forces there.\n\nWalk Around\n\r\nThe MiG-27 retained much of the external features of the MiG-23 before it. The most discernable piece became the redesigned nose cone. As a low-level strike fighter, the MiG-27 had little need for an advanced air-to-air radar as found in the interceptor. The new radar-less nose assembly sported a sleeker look and promoted better look-down views from the cockpit. The cockpit itself was given a new canopy with less framing and a raised pilot seat position. The windscreen was armored as were the cockpit walls to coincide with the new Flogger's low-level role. The engine was a simplified form of the interceptor brand and fitted in a revised rear fuselage with a two-stage afterburner nozzle. An extra underfuselage hardpoint was also introduced.\n\r\nThe wings remained the \"bread-and-butter\" of the new Flogger. Three wing sweep positions could be called upon in-flight to assist in three distinct modes of flying. The fully-extended wing sweep afforded good low-level/low-speed control during take-off and landing as it induced more drag and generated increasing lift. The intermediate wing sweep mode was a balanced setting used during the normal cruise state. The extreme wing sweep was used in the high-performance role for it promoted a smaller forward area profile and less drag to achieve and maintain top straight-line speeds at Mach 1+. The wings were high-mounted along the upper portion of the fuselage and extended from fixed wing \"gloves\" emanating from the upper fuselage. The upper fuselage also housed the heavy and complicated mechanism needed to control the wing sweep.\n\r\nAs a departure from previous Mikoyan-Gurevich designs, the MiG-27 featured side-mounted rectangular intakes to make room for the nose cone at front. The inlets were fixed and fed the single Soyuz powerplant situated in the middle of the fuselage. A raised fuselage spine blocked most of the critical rear view from the cockpit and led up into a tapered swept vertical tail fin. The vertical tail fin was balanced by a ventral tail fin also with sweep. The horizontal tailplanes were high-mounted and straddled either side of the jetpipe.\n\nVariants\n\r\nThe MiG-27 was produced in only two major variants covered under the NATO codenames of \"Flogger-D\" and \"Flogger-J\", though each held their own notable sub-variants.\n\r\nThe MiG-27 was the base \"vanilla\" production model designation and sported a revised canopy (no central vertical frame thus improving vision out of the cockpit and also simplifying the ejection process). Special electro-optical and radio gear was installed in bullet fairings on the wing gloves and the original MiG-23 twin-barreled 23mm cannon was replaced by a six-barreled GSh-6-23M 23mm Gatling gun.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan MiG-27 (Flogger)", "aircraft_type": "Swing-Wing Ground Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "9e67e4bb-4179-4b79-9e09-563354068b2f", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mil Mi-14 (NATO codename of \"Haze\") is a maritime conversion of the popular Soviet-era Mi-8 transport helicopter. It retains much of the form and function of its land-based predecessor but adds capabilities in the realm of submarine hunting, Search and Rescue and mine / mine-countermeasures. The Mi-14 has an inherent design quality about it to land and take-off from water sources and can be outfitted with torpedoes, depth charges, naval mines and conventional drop bombs - held in a watertight belly compartment. While only some 230 were originally built, the type continues in active service with several former Soviet allies. Production spanned 1969 until 1986 with the key operator becoming Soviet Naval Aviation.\n\r\nThe original Mi-8 was first-flown in prototype form on July 7th, 1961 and was introduced into service in 1967. It provided a natural successor to the aging line of Mi-4 helicopter which held origins back in the early 1950s. The Mi-8 went on to see a plethora of global operators adopt the type and these were flown in various roles while some 17,000 units have been produced from 1961 to today (2017).\n\r\nFrom this proven framework was born the Mi-14 in a 1968 initiative and this gave rise to the \"V-14\" prototype designation. The twin-engine arrangement of the Mi-8 was retained  and large sponsons were added to the four-point undercarriage for on-water landings and take-offs. The engines of choice became 2 x Klimov TV3-117MT turboshaft engines used to drive a five-bladed main rotor and three-bladed tail rotor (offset to starboard). In testing the prototype, the TV2-117 engine would be used instead. The crew would number four personnel.\n\r\nA first-flight was recorded on August 1st, 1967 and production then ensued in 1973, this large gap brought about by issues with the engines and avionics fit. In service, the aircraft was designated \"Mi-14\" and known to NATO as \"Haze\". Service entry occurred in May of 1976 and the series was in active service up until 1996 when thawing relations between the United States and Russia ultimately forced their withdrawal.\n\r\nWhile V-14 represented the prototype used in testing the series, Mi-14PL (\"Haze-A\") became the initial production form. This model was used in the Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) role and carried a towed Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) as well as sonobouys and search radar. Armament was a torpedo, depth charges or bombs. Performance specs included a maximum speed of 230 kmh and a range (ferry) of 1,135 kilometers. Its service ceiling was listed at 3,500 meters.\n\r\nThis mark was followed by the improved Mi-14PLM with all-new radar fit, new ASW equipment and modern digital processing. The Mi-14BT (\"Haze-B\") was a mine-sweeping platform lacking the ASW functionality and about 30 were built to the standard. Several made their way to the Bulgarian and East German navies. Mi-14PS (\"Haze-C\") was a dedicated Search & Rescue model and outfitted with applicable equipment for the role.\n\r\nThe Mi-14PZh was a conversion of the Mi-14BT for fire-fighting duties. These were followed by the Mi-14PZh \"Eliminator III\" of same form and function. The Mi-14GP was a general purpose model for passenger hauling duties, seating some twenty-six in relative comfort. The Mi-14P was another civilian market model and this sat twenty-four.\n\r\nThe Poles were key recipients of the Mi-14 and knew it as the Mi-14PL/R. A pair of these flew in SAR guises (lacking ASW equipment). The Polish Navy used the related Mi-14PX in SAR training role.\n\r\nCurrent (2017) operators of the Mi-14 Haze series include Georgia, Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, Poland, Republic of the Congo, Syria and Ukraine. There are calls by the modern Russian Navy to reactivate the series for frontline service due to deteriorating relations with the United States.

During the latter half of the Cold War (1947-1991), the Soviet Air Force adopted a new single-seat, single-engine aerobatic basic trainer in the Yakovlev \"Yak-50\". Production of the type spanned from 1975 to 1986 and ended with 314 units completed. The series went on to serve the air services of Lithuania and Ukraine as well as the reborn Russian Air Force following the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991.\n\r\nThe Yak-50 series was developed from the existing Yak-18 (NATO codename of \"Max\") which appeared in the immediate post-World War 2 world during 1946 (and is detailed elsewhere on this site). This two-seat, single-engine platform was widely exported to Soviet allies for its time in the air with local license production also had in neighboring nations such as China (where it became the \"Nanchang CJ-5\").\n\r\nExternally, the aircraft carried a long, slim, aerodynamically-refined fuselage with the engine neatly cowled in the nose section and used to drive a two-bladed propeller unit at the extreme front. The cockpit was placed directly at midships and  was given all of the basic instrumentation expected of a trainer in a neat arrangement with prominent dials, gauges and appropriate labeling. Vision was good considering the cockpit's placement at the middle of the design as light framing was used. The canopy was set on rails to roll backwards along the frame for entry/exit. The mainplanes were of a straight monoplane form with clipped tips and they were seated ahead of midships for proper balance of the aircraft. The tail unit incorporated a traditional single-finned arrangement with low-set horizontal planes. All control surfaces were skinned in fabric as a weight-saving measure. The undercarriage, made retractable, utilized a basic \"tail-dragger\" support structure.\n\r\nDimensionally, the aircraft exhibited a running length of 25.6 feet with a wingspan of 31.1 feet and a height of 10.5 feet. Empty weight reached 1,655lb against a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) nearing 2,005lb.\n\r\nThe typical engine fit became the Vedeneyev M-14P 9-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine outputting 360 horsepower though this could be substituted with the M-14PF or M-14R series models which offered an increased horsepower output of 400hp and 450hp, respectively. The added power output increased performance in turn. Performance specs included a top speed of 250 miles per hour (with a never-exceed-speed of 280mph). Range was out to 310 miles and the aircraft's service ceiling reached 13,125 feet. Rate-of-climb was rated at 3,145 feet-per-minute under full take-off power.\n\r\nIn practice, the Yak-50 trainers gave a good account of themselves for their robust airframes could be pushed to extreme limits and handling characteristics was judged to be excellent for the lightweight aircraft. Its design success was such that the series twice claimed the World Aerobatic Champion title. Soviet military models were quite excessively pushed to their limits to the point that mainplane spar failures became an issue - resulting in several directives aimed at strengthening these members for the remainder of the aircraft's service lives in the Soviet Air Force.\n\r\nWhile out-of-service militarily worldwide today (2018), the aircraft can still be found in the hands of private flyers mainly in the West. The Yak-50 was eventually superseded by other, more modern, basic trainer forms in time such as the Yakovlev Yak-55 series of the 1980s.\n\r\nThe Yak-52 was a single-engine two-seat offshoot of the Yak-50 line. This version appeared in 1976 but was not formally introduced until 1979, becoming the standard Soviet Air Force primary trainer for several decades (its use continues today, 2018).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-50", "aircraft_type": "Basic Trainer / Aerobatic Lightweight Aircraft"}, {"id": "fdef5f2b-4afc-4e26-92c1-9e57a94f027a", "year_model": "1974", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sukhoi Su-24 \"Fencer\" was the Soviet answer to the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark.

After some 35+ years of active service, the end is near for the impressive Fencer, gradually outdated in many facets of her makeup. She was debuted in anger during the Soviet war in Afghanistan and saw combat in the Persian Gulf War of 1991, actions against Chechen rebels of the Chechen Republic and thought to have participated in recent operations over South Ossetia in the 2008 \"limited war\" with Georgia.

One of the pre-requisites of the Soviet Air Force's acceptance of the Su-7 into service was that the firm also develop a suitable all-weather strike variant to be tied with a new navigation/attack system known as the \"Puma\".\n\r\nSukhoi set about on some preliminary work in trying to utilize the existing Su-7 airframe for the all-weather strike task. It was quickly realized that the Su-7's airframe was ill-suited for the amount of additional avionics and equipment that would be required in making the Fitter a right \"fit\" for the role. As a result, other designs solutions were entertained.\n\r\nWhile introduction of the Fitter did well to strengthen the Soviet Air Force's aging fleet of fighters, there was no true solution in beefing up her long-range bomber arm. In the inventory remained the aged Ilyushin IL-28, introduced in 1950 and categorized as a medium bomber. The Yakovlev Yak-28 \"Bewer\"/\"Firebar\"/\"Maestro\" series was unveiled in 1958 and first flew in 1960, intended to become the answer to the growing Soviet question. However, once in service, the Yak-28 was quickly noted for its disappointingly short operational ranges and small payload capabilities - two qualities critical to a successful bomber design in the Cold War. Additionally, weapons firing and general munitions delivery accuracy left something to be desired by the Soviet Air Force. Regardless, some 1,180 such systems were placed into circulation and the type was developed to fulfill a variety of battlefield functions.\n\nThe F-111 Outshines Them All\n\r\nSoviet personnel were not blind to the aviation progress being made in the United States as per their USAF General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark twin-engine, swing-wing, two-seat fighter-bomber. The aircraft began its life in 1964 and was officially introduced in 1967, pioneering a variety of technological advancements in the realm. The F-111 featured a terrain following radar (as opposed to terrain avoidance radar), variable sweep of her swing-wing assemblies and an afterburning turbofan engine. Swing-wing capabilities allowed an aircraft to vary its drag during different phases of flight - landing, take-off, cruise. \n\r\nWhile practical in both use and design, a \"swing-wing\" approach often involved a complicated set of internal working functions that had to be incorporated into an already complicated aircraft design. Only a few aircraft have ever fielded variable sweep wings and this included such notables as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Panavia Tornado, Rockwell B-1 Lancer and Tupolev Tu-160 \"Blackjack\" - all appearing some time later. Terrain following radars served the aircraft by allowing it to fly at supersonic speeds just underneath the perceived radar screen and deliver munitions from this low altitude with accuracy. It should be noted, however, that the F-111 itself overcame a variety of obstacles during her development - these being both political and technological in nature - to become the 560+ examples delivered to the USAF. Success, it seemed, came at a cost from any angle. On the other hand, the new breed of military aircraft being fielded by the Americans now outclassed just about any Soviet offering at the time.\n\r\nOf similar note here is the technological advancements made in the world of surface-to-air detection and engagement - also playing a key role in the growing Soviet long-range bomber need. The current crop of Soviet bombers were ill-suited in their operations against such newer active defenses being fielded by NATO allies. For the Soviets, what once appeared to be a small hole in the dike initially had now exploded to become a bleeding chasm of desperation to some extent.\n\r\nSukhoi set to work to fulfill the new Soviet air arm requirement. They set their eyes on a long-range interdiction bomber design mimmicking the performance capabilities of the American F-111 without the complicated swing-wing functionality. The culmination of this early design work revealed the S-6, a mockup delta-wing model design fitting a pair of side-by-side Tumansky R-21F-300 turbojet engines. The aircraft would be piloted by a crew of two personnel seated in tandem, this helping to achieve a slimmer forward profile. While the design was ultimately reviewed, the progress was eventually nil as the \"Puma\" nav-attack system development was lagging sorely behind. Further tests of the mockup also revealed some key limitations that would ultimately doom the S-6 as a viable solution.\n\nThe S-58VD Flying Laboratory\n\r\n1964 saw the Sukhoi firm press their attention onto the \"S-58M\", a modified form of their Su-15 \"Flagon\" interceptor product. By this time, the Soviet Air Force came back with a revision to their original requirement and sought an airframe with STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) capability. This provided for something of a mechanical nightmare to the internal design layout of the new Sukhoi aircraft. Not only was the type to feature two afterburning turbojet engines for the supersonic speed requirement, she was now required to showcase STOL qualities through the implementation of four smaller turbojet engines for improved vertical ascension. The powerplants of choice became a pair of Tumansky R-27F-300 base engines and four Kolesov RD-36-25 series turbojets to fulfill the vertical thrust role. The radar of choice came under the \"Orion\" name. An existing Su-15 airframe was converted for the new engine arrangement to become the developmental \"S-58VD\". The new S-58VD was given a wider cross-section to make room for the crew of two seated side-by-side as well as the wider radar system to be mounted in the nose. Comparatively, the S-58VD shared a general overall external appearance to the Su-15 it was developed from (including the dual Tumansky engine layout and single vertical tail fin) but the wider forward profile quickly differentiated the type from the original.\n\r\nThe S-58VD featured a long, relatively flat nose cone ahead of the two-man cockpit. The pilot and co-pilot sat under a canopy not unlike that as featured in the F-111 Aardvark. Each professional sat in \"zero-zero\" Zvezda K-36D series ejection seats, allowing for ejections at any airspeed and at any altitude (in contrast to earlier seat designs that required certain speed and altitude minimums). The streamlined fuselage contoured rather elegantly into the squared-off rear body. Rectangular intakes were fitted to either side of the fuselage and this boxy shape carried on to the aft portion of the airframe. Wings were fixed and swept along their trailing edges in a sort of \"double-delta\" format, with each wing featuring a pair of underwing weapon stations. The tail section was dominated by the single vertical fin and applicable horizontal tail surfaces to each aft fuselage side (the latter all-moving surfaces). The undercarriage was conventional and made up of two double-tired main landing gear legs and a nose landing gear leg fitted a pair of smaller wheels. Of particular note in the S-58VD design were the four RD36-35 lift engines buried within the middle portion of the fuselage at about amidships. The upper panel of each intake sported doors meant to open and aspirate the engines when they were activated for STOL flight. The developmental aircraft was now assigned the more formal designation of \"T-6\" in 1965.\n\r\nThe S-58VD design itself would go on to become a flying laboratory of sorts, collecting STOL data from 1966 into 1969. Her captured information proved invaluable and showcased a loss of operational range over the gain of her STOL capability. Lift engines were always something of a peculiar love affair with aircraft engineers since the prospect of vertical flight was born with Leonardo Da Vinci. However, in 1960s terms, the devices required to achieve such flight were still rather large contraptions taking up vital internal space and making up critical weight increases for very little tactical gain. The areas within such an aircraft were best suited for the carrying of internal fuel stores to feed thirsty afterburning turbojet engines. Control of the S-58VD during the STOL process was also noted to be adequate at best, requiring much attention and direct pilot interference. True STOL operation would not be realized until the arrival of the subsonic British Harrier jump jet and perfected to an extend by the upcoming stealthy Lockheed F-35 Lightning II.\n\nThe T6-1 Prototype\n\r\nThe initial T6 prototype became the \"T6-1\", completed in May of 1967 and launched for the first time on July 2nd of that year. Initial evaluations were conducted sans the four lift jets to do away with early complexities during in-flight performance testing. The lift jets were not installed on the T6-1 until October of 1967 and the primary Tumansky R-27F-300 turbojet engines were later replaced in whole by a new pair of Lyulka-brand AL-21F series engines.\n\nThe F-111 Raises Eyebrows\n\r\nThe Soviet Air Force vision for the new aircraft was decidedly different than the T6-1 being offered from Sukhoi. Testing revealed that the design - in her current form - lacked the desired function sought. The 1967 display of the American F-111 Aardvark at the Paris Air Show only served to drive home the painful point - her variable wing, low-level flying was duly noted by aircraft firms all over the world - Sukhoi and her Soviet overseers being no exception. Her variable geometry wing design proved the swing-wing concept sound for a powerful mount such as the Aardvark. The Sukhoi firm finally steered itself in the direction of applying a similar swing-wing style function to their T6.\n\nThe T6-2I Prototype\n\r\nWork on a new T6 prototype began on August 7th, 1968, producing the T6-2I. The T6-2I was essentially the T6-1 airframe mated to a new variable geometry wing system though the four lift jets were formally dropped. First flight was achieved on January 17th, 1970 and testing continued on until 1976, covering some 300 total flights. Seventy-three flights were made by T6-2I in 1971 and covered basic flight dynamics incorporating the various wing sweep settings. Only later were more complex systems thrown into the mix (including the automated flight system) and most evaluations were handled at low altitudes. A second swing-wing prototype, the T6-3I, was included beginning in late 1970. The T6-3I completed 90 flights in 1971 and contributed 300 flights of her own. A fourth swing-wing prototype, the T6-4I, began evaluation service on June 16th, 1971 but was lost to accident in 1973 after completing just 120 flights. Final evaluation of the T6 program concluded in 1976 with various landing scenarios to test out the airframe during rough-field, unpaved operations.\n\r\nFurther development of the T6 eventually included the incorporation of the \"Puma\" nav-attack system coupled with the \"Orion-A\" attack radar. Terrain avoidance was handled by the Relyef radar and featured an automatic flight guidance system. The design was furthered into production-standard forms within time. Even before the new aircraft had completed her various test regimes, however, the Soviet Air Force - happy with what it saw in its IL-28 replacement - quickly ordered the type for production under the designation of \"Su-24\".\n\nFencer Production\n\r\nProduction was selected to begin at Factory No. 153 at Novosibirsk. The first production Su-24 went airborne on December 31st, 1971, with test pilot Vladimir Vylomov at the controls. Early Su-24s (\"Fencer-A\") were fielded in small numbers and this limited to trials units, leaving the Fencer-Bs as the true initial production face of the line. Fencer-C came online some time later and sported improved avionics. Though differences between the three were many, they were more-or-less minor enough to not warrant new designations from Sukhoi. Only NATO required the varying \"Fencer\" designations for their own nomenclature.\n\r\nHer rush to delivery produced a few teething problems from the start, forcing several  - though multiplying - modifications to be enacted (both to current and former aircraft) based on operational feedback from crews. Such changes included the enlarging of an internal fuel tank to increase the aircrafts range. Another included am aerodynamic revision of key rear fuselage surfaces in an effort to reduce airframe drag. The brake chute was relocated and a ram-air inlet was installed at the base of the tail fin. While early Su-24s sported variable intake ramps within their intake openings, this was later dropped to improve maintenance requirements and save on weight. The removal of these devices dropped the overall speed of the Su-24 from Mach 2.18 to Mach 1.35 - as devastating as this may have appeared, the expected low-level operations of the Su-24 suffered little in the move. The countermeasure capabilities of early Su-24s were progressively updated to include improved radar warning and missile launch warning coupled with integral onboard jamming equipment.\n\r\nThe Su-24 would not be formally accepted into service until February 6th, 1975. Her slab-sided fuselage eventually earned her the nickname of \"Suitcase\" from her crews. The West would not find out about the Su-24 until perhaps 1974 to which the incorrect designation of \"Su-19\" was assigned. Interestingly, this mistake would not be officially corrected until 1981. In true NATO fashion, the codename of \"Fencer\" was applied to the Su-24 - \"F\" being for \"Fighter\" (\"B\" was reserved for Bombers as in the \"Brewer\", \"Bear\", \"Bison\" etc...). It was not until the Soviet Air Force began arriving at East German air fields in 1979 did many of the fantastic Western estimates about the new Soviet aircraft finally dissolve.\n\nSu-24 Walk-Around\n\r\nThe Su-24's external design owed much to both the T6 prototypes as well as the Su-15 \"Flagon\" from which it was directly developed from. She sported a long oblong fuselage with flat surfaces along all her sides save for the upper surface. The cockpit was situated aft of the nose assembly housing the important radar suite. The operators (pilot and systems officer) sat in a side-by-side arrangement under a glass canopy featuring relatively light, unobtrusive framing. There was a forward canopy portion split at the center and a main canopy portion that opened as individual assemblies, each hinged along their respective rear frames. The pilot and his radar operator entered/exited the aircraft by way of individual \"clip-on\" ladders to the left and right sides of the forward fuselage. This was a necessity for the Su-24 sat a good distance from the surface of the tarmac - herself measuring some 20-feet, 4-inches in overall height. By any measure she proved a very large design when viewed up close. As in her prototype, the air intakes were mounted along the sides of the fuselage and sported rectangular openings to aspirate their respective turbojet engines buried further aft in the fuselage. Of note here was use of splitter plates to divert \"dead air\" away from the intake mouth and fuselage sides. Interestingly, the rounded curves of the forward fuselage quickly gave way to the true Soviet-style Cold War-era design of sharp angles and flat, featureless surfaces found further aft. The tricycle undercarriage remained largely unchanged from the prototypes.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-24 (Fencer)", "aircraft_type": "Long-Range Strike / Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "ffd99cd6-a565-4247-8e6d-44c1fdb71ef3", "year_model": "1973", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet-era Ilyushin IL-18 (\"Coot\") serves as the basic framework of the advanced IL-22 \"Coot-B\" form. The IL-22 is intended for use as an \"Airborne Command Post\" (ACP) in the ranks of the modern Russian Air Force and is equipped with the needed systems and subsystems for the role. The original IL-18 flew for the first time on July 4th, 1957 and entered service thereafter with production of the airframe running from 1957 until 1985 to which under 700 were ultimately manufactured by Ilyushin. The Il-18 also serves as the basis for the IL-38 Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform of the Russian Naval Aviation (and is detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nThe IL-22 \"Coot-B\" follows the another IL-18 offshoot, the IL-20 \"Coot-A\", with this airframe reserved for the COMmunications INTelligence / Electronics INTelligence (COMINT/ELINT) reconnaissance role - such has been the versatility of the IL-18 design for its many decades in the air.\n\r\nThe IL-22 variants were converted from the existing stock of IL-18 airliners and modified to house the needed sensors and processing systems for the role. Airborne Command Posts are effectively mobile Command and Control (C2) centers for the military sphere, preferably operating in uncontested airspaces with accompanying defensive-minded escorts, and providing direction to allied units in the air and/ or on the ground. Typically, this is made possible by sophisticated equipment fitted to the host platform.\n\r\nThe aircraft retains its tubular shape with the twin-seat cockpit overlooking the short, blunt nosecone. Circular windows dot the sides of the fuselage which houses the various required systems stations for the accompanying crew. The mainplanes are positioned low along the sides of the fuselage and are straight in their general shape. The aircraft is powered by no fewer than four turboprop engines and these are housed in long, streamlined nacelles seated over the mainplanes and protruding from the wing leading edges. Each drives four-bladed propeller units. A wheeled, retractable undercarriage is used for ground-running, the nose leg positioned under the cockpit with the main legs retracting (forwards) into the inboard engine nacelles. The nose leg is of double-bogie configuration with the main legs each given four wheels apiece to sustain the weight of the aircraft when on the ground.\n\r\nThe aircraft has a noticeable ventral bulging line running from nose to empennage among other protrusions found about its fuselage (particularly the dorsal line). This includes a podded sensor on the very tip of its tail plane.\n\r\nThe basic \"IL-22\" designation represents the start of the series as an operational solution for the Soviet Air Force. Following this mark as the modernized \"IL-22M\" which brought along with it improved equipment for the role.\n\r\nFrom this the IL-22PP \"Porubshchik\" (NATO codename of \"Mute\" and casually known as \"Fridge\" to the Russians) offshoot was established as recently as 2017 as an Electronic Warfare (EW) platform doubling in the reconnaissance and signal jamming roles. The IL-22PP is noted for its side-fuselage bulges at both the forward and aft sections of the fuselage.\n\r\nAll retain the IL-18's four-engined, turboprop configuration and similar performance figures.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-22 (Coot-B)", "aircraft_type": "Airborne Command Post (ACP) Aircraft"}, {"id": "aad09e07-836c-4308-ab11-1d8e2cbe7ae8", "year_model": "1973", "description": "\r\n        \tThe famous Mil Mi-24 \"Hind\" helicopter stemmed from a Soviet Cold-War requirement for a heavily armed and armored transport helicopter following in the mold of the equally famous American Bell UH-1 \"Huey\" model. American activity in the Vietnam War considering their helicopter usage directly influenced the form and function of the Soviet design, developing one of the most iconic aircraft of its time. The type went on to see combat operations throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and continues on in a more assault-oriented role even today - despite its Cold War upbringing. The Hind remains a feared, flexible and proven battlefield implement. Its strengths have been formulated into the more potent Mil Mi-28 \"Havoc\" which is currently seeing deliveries to the Russian Army. While the Mi-28 is a more dedicated anti-tank platform developed specifically to combat enemy armor with crew and systems survivability as a priority, the Mi-24 - its days appearing numbered - still finds a use on the battlefields of today.\n\nOrigins and Development\n\r\nFollowing the end of hostilities that was the Korean War, attention turned to the evolving nature of the battlefield as it related to the helicopter. The Korean War saw the first large-scale use of the helicopter in a variety of roles and the Soviet Army lacked any viable use of the vehicle type. War across Europe - should the Cold War ever go hot - would involve the coordination of thousands of troops coupled with air support and ground support to wage an effective war along multiple fronts. While armored vehicle carriers certainly had their place in Soviet doctrine, thought was given to move mechanized warfare into a new category by delivering a heavily armed assault helicopter capable of transporting combat-ready personnel into critical situations.\n\r\nVarious designs were tossed about with the Soviet firm of Mil heading the initiative. American involvement in the Vietnam War ushered in the new and viable concept of the armed helicopter as both transport and gunnery platform and Soviet authorities were convinced of a similar design. The Soviets initially took to arming their Mil Mi-4 \"Hound\" helicopters for the role but this was nothing more than an interim attempt. Mil - with founder Mikhail Mil in the lead role himself - eventually was tabbed for the endeavor and the ground work was laid for a competing armed helicopter of Soviet origin. The formal Soviet request occurred on May 6th, 1968 for a heavily armed and armored, twin-engine helicopter of great capability an survivability. The official Mil design (to be known as the Mi-24) was signed off in February of 1969.\n\r\nDevelopment of the new helicopter essentially stemmed from the strengths of Mil's preceding product - the Mi-8 \"Hip\". This included the engine arrangement as well as a slightly-modified main rotor attached to a two-person cockpit ahead of a passenger cabin. The fuselage was all-new in its design approach, intended to provide a much smaller head-on target to the enemy. The cockpit design saw the pilot and co-pilot seated in tandem under a joined glass cockpit, heavily framed and boxy in appearance.\n\r\nFirst flight of a prototype occurred on September 19th, 1969, this days after a tethered prototype went airborne. These prototypes were eventually joined y ten developmental vehicles which eventually culminated in evaluations beginning June of 1970. This produced several design changes to the original arrangement (including flipping the direction of the tail rotor and adding the Hind-style ordnance-carrying wings to the mix). The type was finally accepted for serial production and formally introduced into Soviet military service in 1972 - beginning the legacy of what would become the most remembered and identifiable Soviet military machine of the Cold War and staff multitudes of inventories of Warsaw Pact nations. Its initial inception and ultimate global reach became a serious concern to NATO warplanners throughout the Cold War.\n\r\nAfter some operational practice, the cockpit was redesigned to the more familiar Hind shape including two separate, stepped cockpits for better visibility and improved protection from ground-based fire. Additionally, the passenger-carrying quality was lessened as the attack role grew and munitions options took precedence over that of delivering troops to the field. The passenger cabin was later utilized for the carrying of \"refill\" AT-2 series \"Swatter\" anti-tank missiles. The changes - producing the well-known \"Hind-D\" line - helped the Hind grow its performance specifications while reducing its fragility in combat - particularly in the volatile low-level altitudes it was intended to operate in.\n\nHind Walk-Around\n\r\nIn taking the most widely-seen and accepted Hind helicopter form as our basis, the design is dominated by its stepped, two-person cockpit which seats the pilot in the rear and the gunner at the front.  Each position is armored and covered over in heavy, framed bubble glass panels with the front-most gaining the benefit of windshield wiper blades to combat the elements. The glass panels were bulletproof against small arms fire. The pilot's cockpit door was set to open to starboard whilst the gunner's door opened to the portside. The engines are stacked above and behind the cockpit along the rather slim fuselage. The main rotor mast is low-mounted and powers a large, five-bladed main rotor system. The fuselage is slender and rounded along all facings. There is a oft-forgotten passenger cabin at the heart of the fuselage's layout, identified by its many vision ports. The empennage is set off by a high-mounted tail installation that delivers the shaft that powers the large, three-bladed tail rotor fitted to the portside of the aircraft. Horizontal planes are affixed to the rear sides of the tail section. The undercarriage is retractable and consists of a double-wheeled nose landing gear leg and a pair of single-wheeled main legs arranged in a three-point stance along the fuselage bottom. Armament is spread across three major underwing hardpoints. Each wing is mounted above and rear of the passenger areas and fit three hardpoint pylons, two inboard and one at the wing tip. Additional armament is fitted to the starboard fuselage side or, in some models, in an under-forward-fuselage gun mount. Additional optics and specialized equipment can be fitted to the forward fuselage as well.\n\nHind Power\n\r\nPower for the Mi-24 is delivered through a pairing of 2 x Isotov TV3-117 series turbine engines, each delivering up to 2,200 horsepower. This provides the stout mount with a top speed of 208 miles per hour and an operational range nearing 280 miles. The maximum listed service ceiling for the aircraft is 14,750 feet, consistent with other helicopters in this class. Considering the weight of the Mi-24 at 18,740lbs (when empty), a fully-loaded 26,500lb Mi-24 is a non-too agile beast, taking away some of its combat effectiveness when used as a dedicated gunship.\n\nHind Ordnance\n\r\nArmament is the heart and soul of the Mi-24 series. A bevy of internal guns have been fitted to the family line throughout her evolution. This has included the four-barreled 12.7mm Yakushev-Borzov Yak-B Gatling gun and improved through the installation of a 30mm GSh-30K twin-barrel, fixed cannon. For more flexibility, a 23mm GSh-23L cannon was also fitted in a powered turret after combat operations dictated such a development. Additionally, suppression firepower can come in the form of general purpose machine guns mounted at the cabin windows (when in the armed assault role). External ordnance carrying remains the forte of the Hind family line. This includes the mounting of integrated cannon or machine gun pods, anti-tank guided missiles and rocket pods. Additionally, the Hind can utilized conventional drop bombs for strategic bombing of enemy emplacements.\n\nHind Operations\n\r\nThe Hind helicopter series saw its baptism of fire in the 1977 Ogaden War (1977-1978) which involved Ethiopian elements pitted against Somali forces though the first major Soviet use of the machine was in the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghanistan War where Hinds operated in concert with low-flying Sukhoi Su-25 \"Frogfoot\" strike aircraft. The helicopter served in operations aimed at dislodging and disrupting rebel forces throughout the unforgiving Afghan terrain while being assigned to convoy transport and fire support missions as needed. The Mi-24 was designed specifically for such a conflict and made use of cannons, machine guns, rockets and conventional drop bombs in the regular sorties against its guerilla foe. While their heavy armament and armored systems proved well for the low-flying role at hand, these machines also proved vulnerable to low-altitude anti-aircraft systems - particularly the American-made, CIA-delivered FIM-92 \"Stinger\" short-ranged, surface-to-air missile. Despite high losses, Afghan rebels feared and respected the power of the Mi-24s and bestowed the rather terrifying nickname of \"Satan's Chariot\" to the helicopter. Despite the large Soviet commitment to the war effort, the Empire cut its losses in 1989. The last loss of life in the war occurred when an Mi-24 was shot down by Afghan rebels, its crew killed in the crash.\n\r\nThe next key showcase for the Mi-24 was in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War. These forms were the Mi-25 export variant and fighting for the Iraqi military. The near-decade long conflict saw a massive loss of life on both sides with little ground being gained in either direction. While Hinds played a large role, their armament lacked the latest in available technology and were also susceptible to ground-based fire. A most infamous role undertaken by Mi-25s in the war were in the much-publicized chemical-based attacks on unarmed Kurdish civilians in Northern Iraq. The conflict between the two Arab nations also saw the Mi-24 engage enemy aircraft including the recorded downing of an American-made Bell AH-1 Cobra and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II operated by the Iranians. Iraqi Mi-25s were put to use once again in the 1990 Iraqi invasion of neighboring Kuwait, sparking the 1991 Persian Gulf War which resulted in a stellar Iraqi military defeat. Into the 1990s, the Hind garnered an increasing reputation through the Croatian War of Independence, the Chechnya Wars and other world-wide conflicts. In the latter part of the decade they also saw operations in the Kosovo War.\n\r\nTo a much more modern extent, the Mi-24 has continued strong use of force in both the Afghanistan invasion of 2001 and Iraqi invasion of 2003 following the events of 9/11. Polish Mi-24 mounts have been used in support of coalition forces and even delivered six of its own Hinds to the Afghan military. In the 2008 South Ossetia War, both the Russians and Georgians fielded their own Mi-24 systems - the Russians inevitably holding the advantage in the lop-sided conflict. The 2011 Arab uprising in Libya has seen Libyan leader Gaddafi utilize his powerful Hinds against rebel forces. Several are known to have been lost in the ensuing figting.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-24 (Hind)", "aircraft_type": "Armed Assault Gunship / Attack Helicopter"}, {"id": "97b007e4-dfaa-40d1-a56a-8b6f8fc65802", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Aero L-39 series of advanced jet trainer and light strike aircraft followed along the same lines as its predecessor - the L-29 \"Delphin\" detailed elsewhere on this site - in terms of development. Designed just three years after the successful L-29 became the frontline advanced trainer for the Soviet Union and associated Bloc countries, the L-39 emerged in prototype form and recorded its first flight on November 4th, 1968 prior to introduction with the Czechoslovakian Air Force in 1972. From then on, the aircraft was equally accepted and successful in the training of a new generation of pilots for the Soviet Empire and its satellite states and supporters. Total production exceeding 3,000 aircraft from 1971 to 1999. It became the first turbofan-powered trainer to enter serial production.\n\r\nCompared to the earlier L-29, the L-39 was a more simplified approach with modularity in mind, allowing the newer aircraft to be produced more efficiently and quicker than its counterpart. The powerplant increased thrust was added as was a new avionics suite along with a reinforced structure. The tandem, twin-seat aircraft - as in the L-29 before it - allowed for unfettered views out of the cockpit (save for the rear), bringing about a heightened sense of situational awareness. The training derivative was eventually branched into a light strike form and four underwing hardpoints were used to carry various ordnance options including rocket pods, air-to-air missiles, and conventional drop bombs. This was in addition to the standard, centerline-mounted 23mm GSh-23L twin-barrel cannon for close-in work.\n\r\nOutwardly, the L-39 was a complete revision over the L-29. It sported low-set, straight-edged,  monoplane mainplanes with a well-sloped nose assembly. Views were hindered by the raised fuselage spine but this, in turn, allowed for increased internal storage space. Twin, half-moon intakes were set to either side of the slim fuselage which aspirated the single turbofan engine installation. The tail unit included a single vertical tail fin and low-mounted horizontal planes as well as the singular jetpipe. The tricycle undercarriage consisted of a single-wheeled nose leg and two single-wheeled main legs under the wings.\n\r\nExport numbers for the L-39 Albatross were abundant was the case with the L-29 - though roughly the same set of customers greeted the new machine. Thailand went on to purchase forty of an export model designated with L-39ZA/ART that featured Israeli-produced Elbit avionics. The most numerous in terms of production was the L-39C model which helped drive total production of the L-39 system as a whole past the 3,000 mark.\n\r\nVariants have included the five prototypes and two static airframes as the L-39X (-01 through -07). The L-39C was the standard trainer for many Soviet entities during the Cold War. The L-39CM became an upgraded C-form for the Slovakian Air Force. The Ukrainians received the L-39M1 with AI-25TLSh series turbofan engines. The L-39V variant covered target tugs for the Czechoslovakian Air Force. A weapons trainer emerged as the L-39ZO. An armed trainer and light attack platform became the L-39ZA which supported air-to-air missile launching. The L-39ZAM was a Slovakian Air Force modernization of the L-39ZA mark.\n\r\nThe L-39 was then offered in a more refined form through the L-59 \"Super Albatros\" and the line further branched to include the L-159 \"Alca\". However, these did not go on to achieve the same level of success as the L-39, leaving Aero Vodochody to now offer an all-new, modernized version of the L-39 instead as the L-39NG (\"Next Generation\"). This was announced in August of 2014 with intended upgrades aimed at the avionics suite and engines (the U.S.-built Williams FJ44 series). The aircraft would serve the current military market as a low-cost advanced jet trainer alternative to more pricier mounts emerging from the West and Russia. The prototype is expected to go airborne sometime in 2016 with the product becoming available in 2018.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Aero L-39 Albatros", "aircraft_type": "Advanced Jet Trainer / Light Attack Aircraft"}, {"id": "9725fc5a-05a1-4f2b-a1d4-b9009e1477e0", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tLike the Tupolev Tu-95 \"Bear\" and the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 \"Fishbed\", the MiG-25 (NATO reporting name of \"Foxbat\") became symbolic of the Soviet air threat posed to the West (and her respective interests worldwide) throughout the latter half of the Cold War. The high-speed, high-altitude interceptor was a record-setter from the beginning and would serve in some quantity with air forces within the Soviet sphere of influence for decades. Their most notable actions occurred in the Iran-Iraq War with some modest successes and lesser so in the follow-up 1991 Gulf War, where many were destroyed on the ground by coalition forces. Regardless, the MiG-25 was a powerful aircraft in every sense of the word and was a deadly design if used in conjunction with proper facilities and expertly trained personnel. Designed to meet the proposed North American B-70 \"Valkyrie\" jet-powered bomber series that never was, the MiG-25 nevertheless went down in aviation history as a successful Soviet-era venture - one whose fruits can still be valued today, albeit in limited service numbers. The MiG-25 did well to counter the Lockheed SR-71 spy plane as well as force the pricey development (and ultimate production) of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle air superiority series. Some 1,190 MiG-25s of all types were eventually produced covering interception, reconnaissance, ELINT, training and bombing duties.\n\r\nThe MiG-25 would never be confused with a \"dedicated\" fighter by any regard for her high-operating speed, poor out-of-the-cockpit visibility and rapid use of fuel preclude her from any long-standing aerial engagement. Instead, she became a very specialized thoroughbred designed with the single-minded lethal purpose of interception - led to her targets by way of powerful ground-based radar systems - while fielding a healthy collection of hard-hitting missiles. The MiG-25 utilized some of the largest missiles (19.5 feet in length) ever fitted to an aircraft in the AA-6 \"Acrid\" series, able to engage targets some 50 miles away. Foxbats were therefore stationed along both sides of the Soviet Empire, protecting its airspace from anything the West could seemingly muster. The arms race was in full swing and every move required a critical counter-move to match.\n\r\nIn the late 1950s, the United States Air Force undertook development of a long-range, supersonic strategic bomber capable of Mach 3+ speeds and achieving altitudes upwards of 70,000 feet under the developmental designation of XB-70 \"Valkyrie\". The aviation firm of North American - designer and developer of the World War 2-era war-winning P-51 Mustang fighter - was tabbed with its creation. The idea behind such an airframe was in presenting Soviet air defenses with an untouchable target - outclassing the latest interceptors or surface-to-air missile systems then in inventory and those charged with protecting the vast airspace of the Soviet realm. The United States Air Force's Strategic Air Command envisioned a fleet of B-70 bombers in its stable, holding a distinct advantage in capabilities of reconnaissance and delivery of munitions should the Cold War ever go \"hot\". In response to the XB-70, the Soviets enacted a counter-program to shore up its aged and limited air defense network - a proposed Mach 3-capable manned interceptor to serve directly with the PVO - the Soviet Air Defense Force. Work on the aircraft began in the middle of 1959.\n\r\nThe Valkyrie was a large aircraft design, powered by no less than six afterburning turbojet engines and fielding an impressive streamlined shape. However, missile technology began evolving at such a rapid pace even before the proposed bomber took to the skies and intercontinental ballistic missiles soon took over the role of proposed high-level, fast bombers. Couple these developments with the ballooning costs of the Valkyrie program as a whole and the need for the North American product became less appealing to American warplanners. As such, the Valkyrie program was officially halted and ultimately cancelled in 1961. Despite the cancellation, a pair of prototypes were completed under the experimental designation of XB-70A (a third was under construction but never finished) and first flight was recorded on September 21st, 1964. However, the XB-70A would never serve in an operational military role, instead relegated for use as a supersonic testbed. The series continued as such from 1964 onwards. In 1966, one of the prototypes was lost to accident during a mid-air collision with a trailing observation aircraft during a photoshoot but research flights continued on until 1969. The remaining prototype ended up as a museum showpiece at the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, Ohio, where it resides today.\n\r\nWhile the Americans closed the chapter on their Valkyrie, development of the Soviet \"Valkyrie Killer\" had progressed far enough that cancellation was not in the stars - and perhaps Soviet authorities understood the impending long-term impact of the upcoming Lockheed SR-71 \"Blackbird\" Mach 3-capable strategic reconnaissance jet originating with the company's A-12 of 1962.\n\r\nAs such, the Soviet design team at Mikoyan-Gurevich - a firm having made a name for itself in World War 2 - looked to tackle several key development hurdles en route to a polished end-product. Chief among these became the \"heat barrier\" encountered by high-performance aircraft attempting high-speed flight. The team looked through their available options and realized that they would have to incorporate several different construction technologies and a mix of materials to promote a viable sustaining airframe. Titanium, though expensive and difficult to work with, was selected for its strength and high-heat resistance and tabbed to be used along the nose and leading edges - those surfaces most exposed to heat generation at high speed. Instead of riveted aluminum along other facings, welded steel was utilized. In the end, some 80 percent of the new airframe would consist of tempered nickel steel along with 11 percent encompassing aluminum alloy and the final 9 percent made up of the valuable titanium. As with any aircraft contending with high-speed, high-altitude flight, pilots of the new Mikoyan-Gurevich aircraft would be forced to wear full-pressure suits - appearing more as space-bound cosmonauts than conventional pilots - for their own safety. The designation of \"Ye-155\" was assigned to the proposed interceptor design and final Soviet approval was handed down in February of 1962.\n\r\nWith the design in place, development - and ultimate construction - began on the Ye-155-P1. On September 9th, 1964, the aircraft was sent aloft for the first time with a pair of the large Mikulin-brand R-15B-300 series turbojet engines delivering 22,500lbs of thrust each. Such power came at a price, however, for each engine was rated a service life of just 150 hours. The aircraft received the Smertch-A radar (NATO: \"Foxfire\") for the intended interception role and armament would be pairings of various air-to-air missiles tied to the powerful radar system. The Foxfire radar maintained the capability of detecting targets out to 62 miles while the aircraft's missile armament would become a mix of both semi-active and infrared-homing R-40R and R-40T series missile systems. The goal of such an aircraft was, naturally, to get aloft as quickly as possible, achieve altitude and race to a threat, detect the incoming enemy and gain initiative and ultimately engage at distance, delivering a lethal payload to the target before triggering a response. The Ye-155-P1 certainly held the qualities of such an interceptor. Subsequent evaluation of the Ye-155-P1 airframe in-flight yielded acceptable results.\n\r\nWhile the Ye-155 was always envisioned for its interception qualities, Mikoyan-Gurevich was not lost on its possible use as an untouchable \"fast reconnaissance\" platform. Even before the interceptor model was made available for its first flight, a reconnaissance prototype - the Ye-155-R1 - recorded its maiden flight on March 6th, 1964, again, proving the airframe held some multi-faceted qualities that could serve Soviet air power interests quite well. The reconnaissance model fitted one vertically-set and four obliquely-set cameras along her forward airframe and could be identified by her antennas further on up the nose assembly. \n\r\nTo further drive the apparent success of Soviet ingenuity when concerning the Ye-155 prototype, the aircraft was assigned a secret designation of \"Ye-266\" (Ye-266M) and utilized as a record-breaking platform, these records ultimately and formally acknowledged by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) and bringing attention of the Soviet design to Western observers for the first time. The first record breaking act occurred on March 16th, 1965 with Alexander Fedotov at the controls, reaching 2,319.12km/h and a 1,000- and 2,000kg payload. 2,982.5km/h was then achieved without a payload in 1967. Fedotov eventually claimed another record by reaching an altitude of 29,977m while carrying a payload of 1,000kg and later netted 35,230m with a 1,000kg payload - the latter record, however, resulting in an double engine flameout and forcing the pilot to glide his aircraft back down to safety. On August 31st, 1977, a Ye-266M fitted with a pair of R-15-BF2-300 engines set a speed record at 123,523.62 feet. Of the 29 records claimed by the new Soviet design, several were not broken until the early-to-mid 1990s while others remain even today. Lockheed's A-12 was quick to capture several records away from the Mikoyan-Gurevich aircraft by May of 1965. Regardless, for their efforts in the design of the Ye-155/Ye-266 and its counterparts, the design Mikoyan-Gurevich design team were given the \"Lenin Prize\" achievement. Incidentally, the Ye-266 record-breaking airframe would prove critical in the development and ultimate production of the upcoming MiG-31 \"Foxhound\" series - a long-range interceptor of 1982 created to overcome the performance limitations of the MiG-25 series once the latter entered service production with Soviet units in the 1970s.\n\r\nProduction of the Soviet interceptor was enacted in 1969 under the military designation of \"MiG-25\". However, reliability issues pertaining to the complex engines reared up during early use, forcing full front line service to be delayed until 1973. Once in operation, the MiG-25 was the same complicated machine as found during development and her operations were more-or-less curtailed to protect her touchy engine qualities. The engines, though inherently powerful, only allowed for short spurts of top level thrust to reach the perceived maximum Mach 3 interception speed so pilots were told to limit general usage to about Mach 2.8 to help maximize optimal engine service lives and avoid flameouts. \n\r\nOnce known to NATO - they believing the new Soviet aircraft to be an agile, dedicated fighter design - assigned the MiG-25 the codename of \"Foxbat\" to coincide with NATO practice of designating Soviet fighters with \"F\" names and bombers with \"B\" names. For much of the remaining Cold War, there stood little in the way of information or imagery concerning the elusive MiG-25. A bit stroke of luck finally formulated on September 6th, 1976, when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected from the Soviet Union and landed his MiG-25P at Hakodate Airport in north Japan. His journey began at Sakharovka Air Base and, upon landing, US intelligence personnel were on hand to take ownership of his MiG-25. It was soon under evaluation to which its ultimate strengths and inherent weaknesses became well known to the American intelligence community. The MiG-25 was by no means an agile fighter but, by then, production of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter - developed to contend with the MiG-25 - was well underway, the new American mount having already entered service in January of 1976. Belenko also brought word with him of the soon-to-arrive MiG-31 series - an interceptor now capable of engaging targets - aircraft and cruise missiles - at low altitudes.\n\r\nOutward design of the MiG-25 \"Foxbat\" was highly conventional by any standard, fitting a long slab-sided fuselage against a square-shaped airframe. The airframe design was necessitated by the installation of the large pair of engines buried deep within the design. Intakes were set to either side of the cockpit and sported sharp angles to accept airflow from the sides of the nose assembly. The nose protruded a great length ahead of the cockpit, eliminating any natural \"look-down\" capability for the pilot. The pilot's vantage point was further hindered by setting the cockpit between the two intake openings with the fuselage spine beginning aft of the canopy. The canopy was a simple two piece system but heat resistant. Wings were of a monoplane arrangement, high-set along the intake sides and swept sharply along their leading edges, less so along the trailing. To counter airflow from these assemblies, the horizontal stabilizers were set well below the main wings and featured similar sweep back, though increased moreso in comparison along their trailing edges. The engine exhaust rings promoted a smoother shape to the fuselage aft section, derailing the true boxy shape of the MiG-25 design to an extent. The engines were set close to one another in a side-by-side seating. As such, twin vertical tail fins were affixed outboard of each engine placement, though both maintained a rather straight - albeit rearward-swept - standing profile. In all, the MiG-25 was consistent with Soviet aircraft design of the time, particularly where speed was involved - utilitarian to the core. The MiG-25 would never win any beauty contests to be sure but its single-minded nature ensured that it was designed to win the aerial confrontations at hand. Its silver exterior was also consistent with many aircraft of this time period, particularly those originating in the 1950s and 1960s.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 (Foxbat)", "aircraft_type": "Supersonic Interceptor / Reconnaissance Bomber Aircraft"}, {"id": "38ac21d6-9939-47b2-bb5e-a3e703a526f4", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tAs the Tupolev Tu-95 \"Bear\" proved a successful strategic bomber across several roles for the Soviet military, a dedicated maritime reconnaissance and Anti-Submarine Warfare variant was evolved from the same airframe as the Tu-142 (NATO codename of \"Bear-F\" and \"Bear-J\"). The Tu-142 was given a lengthened fuselage and received a maritime-minded search radar within a ventral radome. It could be outfitted with anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, naval mines and sonobuoys to counter the threat being posed by more advanced ballistic missile submarines beginning to emerge from the West (armed with the \"Polaris\").\n\r\nAt the heart of the Tu-142 was its onboard equipment which was half of the system (the other being its weaponry). The equipment allowed for the detection, tracking and engagement of undersea vessels coupled with the inherent long-range qualities of the original Tu-95. Also retained was the general four-engine configuration which included swept-back wing surfaces, a traditional tail unit and a slim fuselage. The undercarriage was retractable and of the tricycle arrangement. The operating crew typically numbered 11 personnel.\n\r\nDesign work on a dedicated sub-hunter began back in the 1960s. The Tu-95PLO study emerged from this and cleared to carry upwards of 19,800lbs of ordnance but lacked the needed detection/tracking system which led to the project falling to naught. The idea of a dedicated ASW aircraft then returned in early 1963 when Tupolev was charged by the government with the same requirement. Taking the Tu-95RT (Maritime Reconnaissance and Signals Intelligence) as a starting point, the aircraft was given the proper search radar (based on the one used in the Ilyushin Il-38 \"May\" line) and full naval weapons capability. A specialized navigation system ensured proper and safe travel over water and a dedicated Electronic CounterMeasures kit was installed. An electronics package allowed for reconnaissance in the SIGnals INTelligence role. The wings were only slightly modified from the original Tu-95 with wing area increased for better lift and control. The twin 23mm cannon arrangement in the tail was reduced to one. The undercarriage was revised to a Navy requirement for operations from rough runways. The aircraft differed enough from the original Tu-95 line that it was granted its own designation of Tu-142. For NATO, the series remained under the \"Bear\" codename.\n\r\nFirst flight of a Tu-142 prototype occurred on July 18th, 1968. A second and third prototype joined the stable by the end of the year. Following the requisite testing and evaluation period, the type was formally adopted by the Soviet Navy. Deliveries commenced in 1970. Early versions were marked by NATO as \"Bear-F\".\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-142 (Bear)", "aircraft_type": "Long-Range Anti-Submarine Warfare Bomber"}, {"id": "9e8188d4-be8f-4c72-ae38-a7f2ff1084bc", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tupolev concern of Russia holds an aviation history dating as far back as 1926, having since established a name in large military and commercial aircraft designs. To supply the latter with a new medium-ranged hauler (replacing several outgoing turboprop models), Tupolev assumed a three-turbofan-engined, low monoplane wing design comparable to Western offerings of the time. The three engines were held in the aft-section of the fuselage, a configuration popular during the 1960s and 1970s, and design work on the type preceded its first flight, this recorded on October 4th, 1968. After passing trials and gaining the required certifications, the new design emerged as the Tu-154 with production beginning in 1968 and spanning until 2011. Deliveries from Tupolev to awaiting carriers began in 1970 to which formal introduction was in 1972, this with Aeroflot. 1,025 examples were ultimately produced and this breed stocked some 21 airlines during her operational tenure. Today, roughly 100 are still flying, impressive considering the type's inception over 40 years ago. Upon recognition from the West, NATO observers christened the aircraft the \"Careless\".\n\r\nUnlike Western airliner types, the Tu-154 was specifically designed for very rigorous conditions and for navigating the broad and unforgiving airspaces common to the then-Soviet frontier. The undercarriage was reinforced for operations from rough airfields while the body was developed to content with freezing conditions of the north. Since maintenance facilities in more rural areas of the country would offer little to no service for the aircraft, the Tu-154 was designed to operate for long periods of time before requiring a scheduled overhaul. Such stresses undoubtedly caused several of the 39 published accidents involving the Tu-154 series during its service life. Other factors usually centered around pilot/crew errors and accidents.\n\r\nDesign of the Tu-154 was conventional with a slim, tubular fuselage, forward-set cockpit, low-mounted swept main wing assemblies and a high-mounted Tee-style tailplane atop a vertical fin. All three engines were concentrated to the rear of the design with two straddling the vertical fin and the third buried at its frontal base (running from the fuselage spine). The sides of the fuselage were appropriately dotted with rectangular windows for passenger viewing. There were four rectangular access doors to either fuselage side for quick embarking/disembarking of passengers. Cargo was stored in the deck beneath the passenger seating area. The flight crew sat well-forward in the design with good views over the nose through a framed window set. The vehicle traveled along the ground view a tricycle undercarriage that consisted of two main landing gear legs and a nose leg. The main legs were of note for their multi-wheeled design, wheels numbering six in all. The nose leg was conventional with a two wheel set. Internally. the Tu-154 was arranged to carry approximately 164 passengers. Outwardly, the Tu-154 was highly comparable to the American Boeing 727 series and the British Hawker Siddeley Trident models - both appearing prior to the Tupolev design.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-154 (Careless)", "aircraft_type": "Commercial Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "c89cc690-1c8a-4b7a-b754-fe4caaa51aba", "year_model": "1972", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Tupolev Tu22M \"Backfire\" was/is a dedicated strategic bombing and maritime strike platform primarily serving Soviet interests (both during the Cold War and even today). The Tu-22M represented a further evolution of the original Tu-22 \"Blinder\" which failed to impress along many lines. However, the Tu-22M incorporated enough major changes that it could be considered an \"all-new\" bomber aircraft and brought about improved use of missile armament and supersonic flight as well as introducing variable geometry wings.\n\r\nWhile the original supersonic Tupolev Tu-22 \"Blinder\" medium bomber failed to live to its expectations in replacing the aging Tu-16 \"Badger\" series, work inevitably began on a \"variable-geometry\" of the same aircraft. Variable geometry wings were being researched as early as the 1930s and it was the Germans who made good progress on the subject in World War 2. The technology was furthered during the Cold War with the (arguably) best example of this type of aircraft being the American Grumman F-14 Tomcat carrier-based interceptor. Other aircraft to incorporate this technology ultimately included the Rockwell B-1 \"Lancer\", the General Dynamics F-111 \"Aardvark\", the MiG-23/MiG-27 \"Flogger\", the Panavia \"Tornado\" and the Tupolev Tu-160 \"Blackjack\". The evolution planned for the Tu-22 was nothing new to Soviet avionics for the Sukhoi Su-7 \"Fitter\" began life as a fixed-wing fighter aircraft onto to become the swing-wing Su-17/Su-20/Su-22 family of fighter bombers a short time later.\n\r\nWhat the original Tu-22 design lacked was inherently poor handling. She proved technologically complex and require high maintenance levels with poor turn-around times. She was a complex beast and, to add insult to injury, proved limited in a performance sense - the Tu-22 actually failed to improve upon the qualities of the subsonic Tu-16 in many respects, essentially labeling itself a disappointment overall. Production of the type totaled just 311 aircraft. The implementation of variable geometry wings would allow the \"new\" aircraft the ability to adjust its wing planform inflight, in direct response to changing speeds and airflow, providing stability at low and high speeds. The Tupolev concern toyed with the idea of fitting their Tu-22 with swing-wings as early as 1962 and design work on such an airframe began as early as 1962. Ultimately, the firm produced the \"Samolyot 145\" prototype to test the idea in a practical sense and a formal prototype then emerged as the \"Tu-22M0\" which took to the air for the first time on August 30th, 1968. After a short evaluation period, the \"Tu-22M\" was formally adopted for service in the Soviet Air Force. When NATO observers identified the plane as unique (this in September of 1969), it was assigned the incorrect designation of \"Tu-26\" with the codename of \"Backfire\", Western observers believing that the Tu-22M was, in fact, an all-new aircraft in the traditional sense. The initial production mark (Tu-22M1) therefore became the \"Backfire-A\". \n\r\nThe Tu-22M pre-production form was limited to just nine examples while the early Tu-22M1 was produced in another nine examples in 1971. The first truly \"definitive\" production form therefore became the Tu-22M2 (\"Backfire-B\") with its NK-22 series turbofan engines. The upcoming Tu-22M3 was given improved NK-25 turbofans and was known under the NATO codename of \"Backfire-C\" which went online in 1983 (first flying in 1976). A new nav/attack radar was introduced as were other refinements. A rotary missile launcher was installed in the bomb bay and overall performance specifications were improved to an extent. All Tu-22M-capable Tu-22M production models were then upgraded to the more modern Tu-22ME standard. The Tu-22M3 itself was upgraded to the Tu-22M3M mark with new avionics and provision for guided munitions dispensing. Tu-22M2 versions fitted with NK-23 engines were known as Tu-22M2Ye.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-22M (Backfire)", "aircraft_type": "Swing-Wing Supersonic Strategic / Maritime Bomber"}, {"id": "4316081c-b89a-4bc6-9b1b-12a776deff1e", "year_model": "1970", "description": "\r\n        \tThanks to advances in jet engine technology during the 1950s and 1960s, passenger air travel blossomed during this period of aviation history and one of the more monumental aircraft designs came to be the Boeing 747 - also known as the \"Queen of the Skies\" - which began commercial service in 1970. At the time of its inception, the then-risky private venture became the largest passenger jet airliner, doubling the size of any jet-powered airliner to date - a title that the model would hold for nearly 40 years until the arrival of the competing French-originated Airbus A380 series now taking hold. It also brought about a whole new name of oversized aircraft classified as \"Jumbo Jet\" and introduced the now-popular concept of \"wide-body\" in airliner travel. Despite its 1960s origins, the 747 continues to fly today (March 2014) and fills the product gap between the 777 and newer 787 \"Dreamliner\" models in the Boeing aircraft stable.\n\r\nThe original Boeing 747 - the first ever built - was leased as a showpiece to the Seattle-area \"Museum of Flight\".\n\r\nIn the 1960s, moving people from all points on the globe became a greater challenge than ever before as more and more took to the skies to travel and aircraft opened all new avenues. In turn, aviation companies fought to keep pace and jet technology provided the basis for ever-improved aircraft of greater size and performance. Pan American specified a new, long-range passenger hauler requirement in 1966 and Boeing engineers set to work on an all-new, four-engined design intended to surpass the capabilities of preceding models available anywhere. The resulting product would be a long-haul-route performer, capable of moving hundreds of souls across vast oceans. Christened as the \"747\", the initial vehicle went airborne for the first time on February 9th, 1969. Pan American ordered twenty-five of the new aircraft for its stable - the Boeing \"gamble\" has paid off - and the first of these was introduced with Pan Am on January 22nd, 1970.\n\r\nBoeing engineers elected for a deep fuselage to house two distinct operating floors as well as integrate a lower cargo hold. The aircraft was essentially an upscaled Boeing 707 model though heavily modified to suit the performance and internal volume requirements. The cockpit was set aft of a short nose cone, offering a commanding view of the scenery ahead. Wings were low-mounted and noticeably swept and each assembly held a pair of underslung engine nacelles for the needed power output. The empennage was raised and capped by a single vertical tail fin with swept horizontal planes fitted low. The mammoth size of the 747 required a complex undercarriage with multiple wheels - the nose leg alone featured a dual-tire design. Large flaps were affixed to the wing trailing edges. In all, the 747 was an engineering triumph for its time.\n\r\nThe initial 747 subvariant became the \"747-100\" hauler of 1970 and early forms utilized Pratt & Whitney turbofans until 1975 to which the line began use of both Rolls-Royce and General Electric-branded turbofan engines to help broaden market appeal. The 747-100 group included the modified-frame \"707-100B\" with its higher payload capacity and the \"747-100SP\" (\"Special Performance\") model which featured a reduced-length fuselage to serve in the higher-altitude, longer-range, non-stop hauling role. Boeing eventually manufactured some 250 units of the 747-100 mark with the final entry coming in 1986.\n\r\nNext followed the \"747-200\" which entered service in 1971. The 747-200 was on design tables alongside the 747-100 though development time ensured it entered service later. This mark featured greater payload capacity over that of the 747-100 models but were more or less physically indistinguishable. The 747-200 airframe was further modified to serve in the freighter role (with optional side loading door) or a combination passenger-cargo hauler as the 747-200 \"Convertible\". The 747-200 \"Combi\" was similar in its multi-mission approach. Production of 747-200 aircraft totaled 393 units with the last delivered in 1991.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Boeing 747 (Jumbo Jet)", "aircraft_type": "Long-Range Passenger / Heavy Cargo Transport"}, {"id": "123b5fb4-0780-4ec3-ad0c-050037b228c4", "year_model": "1970", "description": "Let Kunovice - Soviet Union / Czechoslovakia", "aircraft_name": "Let L-410 Turbolet", "aircraft_type": "Twin-Turboprop Utility Aircraft"}, {"id": "d586674b-0d27-4544-a47a-8ec07abc3663", "year_model": "1970", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mach 2-capable MiG-23 \"Flogger\" became the first true \"swing-wing\" fighter to enter service with the Soviet Union and went on to become a primary mount of the Soviet air services (replacing the range-limited MiG-21 \"Fishbed\") making it one of the most-produced and successful aircraft of the Cold War. The MiG-23 was made into a dedicated strike / fighter-bomber in the similar-yet-modified MiG-27 series. The MiG-23 itself went on to prove a reliable and robust performer through decades of service (and several notable wars and conflicts) and continues in active service with some air forces today. Relatively cheap for its time (between three and six million dollars a plane), the Mikoyan-Gurevich product was an easy sell to Warsaw Pact nations and Third World allies alike.

It was only some decades later that the old Western observations were upgraded to conclude that the MiG-23 was an impressive design in its own right, one that could match or (in some cases) out-best many of the available Western counterparts of the time.\n\nAbout the MiG-27 \"Flogger\"\n\r\nThe MiG-27 \"Flogger\" is a direct development of the MiG-23 detailed in this entry and has its own write-up elsewhere on this website. The MiG-27 is essentially a dedicated ground-attack fighter-bomber form of the MiG-23 \"Flogger\" fighter / interceptor. It features the same swing-swing capability but is armored for low-level strike runs, has a broadened ground ordnance role across more external hardpoints and sports new fixed intake inlets. Its engine is decidedly less-complicated and features a simpler nozzle for the reduced-performance role. The twin-barrel cannon of the MiG-23 has given way to a multi-barrel type and special target acquisition systems are standard as is a terrain avoidance radar. The MiG-27 is discernable from the MiG-23 by its sleeker tapered nose cone assembly (promoting better \"lookdown\" capabilities). The MiG-27 was developed in two major derivatives under the NATO codenames of \"Flogger-D\" and the \"Flogger-J\". Use of the MiG-27 was primarily with the Soviet Union and India and began deliveries in 1975, ultimately seeing retirement with Russia in the 1990s. India took up license production of the type under the Hindustan Aeronautics banner as the Bahadur (or \"Valiant\").\n\nBackground\n\r\nMikoyan-Gurevich began as a manufacturer of piston-powered fighters during World War 2 with their most notable creations being the \"hotrod\" MiG-1 and MiG-3 fighters. Success continued in the post-war world with the unveiling of their revolutionary single-seat, single-engine MiG-15 \"Fagot\" jet-powered fighter in the Korean War - coming as quite the surprise to NATO forces to which the North American F-86 Sabre was directly developed to counter the new threat. The MiG-15 was followed into service by the much-improved MiG-17 \"Fresco\", another single-seat, single-engine implement with greater handling and performance overall. The MiG-19 \"Farmer\" then appeared as a twin-engine solution with supersonic (Mach 1.0) capability. Mikoyan-Gurevich found additional success with the development of the MiG-21 \"Fishbed\" - a Mach 2-capable single-seat, single-engine fighter that went on to be used throughout the world as both an interceptor and a limited strike fighter. This lengthy history had cemented Mikoyan-Gurevich as a major player in the development of Cold War jet fighters and solidified valuable experience gained in the design and development of different wing systems to solve different speed criteria and furthered the firm's understanding of jet-powered machines to keep Soviet air forces on par with their American counterparts.\n\r\nBy this time, McDonnell Douglas had brought online the fabulous F-4 Phantom II, a twin-seat, twin-engine Mach 2-capable fighter with a strong dogfighting prowess and inherent strike capabilities. The F-4 featured a powerful radar system coupled with high performance specifications and quickly became the primary mount of the USAF, USN and the USMC during her reign and, later, was fielded across Europe as an ultimate Soviet deterrent. The F-111 Aardvark was another American Cold War fighter design intended to solve a need for both the USAF and USN in one fail swoop. It featured a twin-seat, side-by-side cockpit, powerful twin engines and variable geometry wings for different flight performances. However, this expensive design bloated to become a long-range strike aircraft and was far from a fighter in the end product. Regardless, the F-4 and the F-111 would be the MiG-23's principle adversaries during the latter's design and development stages.\n\nDevelopment\n\r\nThe MiG-21 \"Fishbed\" was good for what it was initially designed for - speed. It could climb fast and achieve speeds of up to Mach 2 while fielding capable avionics and a weapons system that included both short-range cannon and longer-range missiles for most jobs at hand. However, if the MiG-21 was deficient in any areas it was in operational range, combat payload and its reliance on ground-based interception to help guide the system to a target area (no self-sustained sensors were onboard to handle such actions). Jet powerplants had always proven thirsty since the days of World War 2 and post-war jet technology the world over had yet to wholly solve the need for greater range output out of their engines - though progress was sure and steady by the time of the MIG-23 development. The clipped delta wings and slim fuselage of the MiG-21 had limited its armament potential across just four hardpoints by the time of the later production models. In all, this tailed-delta design was adequate for the interception role and, though it was developed into a ground strike variant, it was far from the answer of a the true multi-role performer that the Soviet Air Force was now looking for.\n\r\nDevelopment of the MiG-23 began in the early part of the 1960s as an attempt by the MiG bureau to counter the limitations of their MiG-21 product. As the Soviet authorities were growing evermore disappointed with the range of their MiG-21s, a new official specification was formed by 1965. The specification called for a modern, larger and heavier aircraft to be produced in two varied forms - an interceptor for use by the Soviet air defense force (PVO) and a ground-attack version for use by the Soviet tactical air forces, Frontal Aviation - all this while not requiring the aircraft to use much runway.\n\r\nThe challenge to Mikoyan-Gurevich lay in getting such a large plane off of the ground in a short amount of time. Greater power and size would naturally come at the expense of added weight and require more real estate before take-off and during landing. Two Mikoyan-Gurevich design groups were formed and the first team looked to direct Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) solutions for their new jet. The second design team looked into an airframe approach utilizing a variable geometry wing (or \"swing wing\") assembly to help offset the long take-off runs while at the same time offering greater payloads by making use of underwing hardpoints as well as underfuselage weapon stations. Both designs were put into action concurrently beginning in 1964 and progress was soon realized by 1966.\n\r\nThe first design team put forth the Model 23-01 prototype type (eventually becoming the MiG-23PD). This aircraft was a similar - though larger - \"tailed-delta\" wing design not unlike the MiG-21 before it. Wings were tapered and clipped at the tips while the cockpit sat ahead of a raised fuselage spine and behind a nose cone. Intakes were fitted to the sides of the fuselage to make way for the expected radome. One major difference between the MiG-21 and the Model 23-01 was the fitting of two Kolesov RD-36-35 \"lift\" jets in the fuselage. The lift jets were situated along the center fuselage for best effect and could be used equally in landing and take-off procedures thusly resulting in shorter runway distances being used. Standard thrust would be derived from a single Tumansky R-27-300 standard powerplant placed within the fuselage amidships. Tests were started with a first flight on April 3rd, 1967, and proved the design sound. The aircraft was unveiled at the 1967 Domododevo Air Show three months later to which Western observers took note and - in true NATO fashion - assigned it the lackluster nickname of \"Faithless\".\n\r\nThe second design team took their swing-wing approach and produced the Model 23-11 prototype. Utilizing a similar fuselage as that of the Model 23-01, the Model 23-11 aircraft fitted the same Tumansky R-27-300 powerplant, nose assembly and empennage. However, along its midsection, the 23-11 made use of the heavy and complicated component needed to control the variable geometry wings. The system would allow for the required changes to the wing sweep of the aircraft depending on the in-flight action, in effect promoting better characteristics during the landing/take-off, cruise and high-performance flight categories. First flight was accomplished on April 10th, 1967. Like the 23-01 prototype, the 23-11 prototype was also debuted at Domodoevo and Western observers bestowed the name of \"Flogger\" to the type.\n\nA Decision is Made\n\r\nThe earlier 23-01 prototype was a solid attempt at solving the STOL issue. However, it quickly became apparent that the design was not going to produce a livable solution. The lift jets were effective at their given job during take-off and landing but, once the aircraft was in flight, the lift jets offered no performance  advantage while at the same time penalized the aircraft by increasing its weight. Essentially, once the aircraft was airborne there was little use for these lift jets, making them more of a novelty concept than practical fair.\n\r\nThe 23-11 swing-wing prototype (Ye-231) was promising yet held its own inherent drawbacks. The swing-wing component was a complicated affair that proved heavy and large, requiring a large housing within the fuselage for which to work in. However, the inherent applicable benefits looked to be just what Mikoyan-Gurevich and Soviet authorities were looking for. The wings could be made strong enough to sustain heavy ordnance loads - greater than that of the preceding MiG-21 - while still retaining performance. As such, priority was given to the 23-11 design, leaving the 23-01 prototype to the pages of aviation history books.\n\r\nFlight testing of the 23-11 prototype continued on into 1968 and culminated with the 98th flight - not one flight recorded any serious abnormalities in the design. The smooth development ushered in a production order and the legacy of the MiG-23 \"Flogger\" was now born.  The MiG-23 was introduced in 1970 and began entering service in 1971,being made ready in quantity by 1973.\n\nWalk-Around\n\r\nThe utilitarian appearance of the MiG-23 can work well in fooling the casual observer to quickly writing off the MiG-23 as \"just another Cold War workman-like Soviet design\". However, despite the aircraft's basic design layout and many conventional components, the MiG-23 proved that there was more to the airframe than what was exhibited. The design was capped by a conical assembly housing the radar system. The cockpit was situated just aft of this assembly and featured seating for the pilot with adequate views forward, above and to the sides. Cockpit vision was hindered by way of the raised fuselage spine and high-mounted wings, both playing critical roles in the variable geometry wing process. Rear-view mirrors helped to an extent but the priority for the design was always in forward and downward visibility from the cockpit at high speeds. \n\r\nGoing against previous Mikoyan-Gurevich jet designs and their identifiable nose-mounted intakes, the MiG-23 utilized split rectangular side intake inlets with each opening fitted to either side of the fuselage, just aft of the cockpit. From there, the fuselage took on a tubular look with slab-sides. The empennage consisted of a large single engine exhaust ring, a large-area tapered vertical tail fin emerging from the fuselage spine and sporting clipped and swept edges and strong conventional horizontal tailplanes. A ventral fin was noted just under the engine exhaust housing. One of the definitive characteristics of the MiG-23 became its tricycle landing gear arrangement with all three centered along the fuselage (as opposed to fitting the main landing gears in the wings - impossible on a swing-wing aircraft design). The complicated main landing gears retracted into housings along the sides of the fuselage and were single-wheeled. The twin-wheeled nose landing gear recessed rearwards just under the cockpit floor. When at rest on the ground, the MiG-23 definitely maintained a pronounced and distinct appearance all her own.\n\r\nOf course the most notable exception to the \"conventionality\" of the MiG-23 design lay in its wings. The wings were extended from the main fuselage body via static swept-wing \"gloves\" located at the wing roots. The variable geometry wing system allowed for three modes of flight that included take-off/landing, cruising and high-performance. The initial mode with wings fully extended sported a (approximately) 16-degree sweep angle and was sufficient in promoting stable low-speed flight by incorporating more drag and lift. The second mode, this at a 45-degree sweep angle, was used in typical cruising actions where a balance of drag and sweep was optimal. The final mode saw the wings fully-retracted by way of a 72-degree sweep, allowing for good high-performance flight at altitude by decreasing drag and forward surface area. The value of such a system would still allow the MiG-23 to carry a potent ordnance load across fuselage, wingroot and underwing weapon stations while still retaining strong performance output. Additionally, the MiG-23 afforded its operators an increase in range that would make the MiG-21 envious.\n\nArmament\n\r\nLike the MiG products before it, the  lethality of the MiG-23 was made potent by its ever-expanding weapons suite primarily coupled to the radar, HUD (Heads-Up Display) and gunsight. Standard armament became a twin-barreled 23mm Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L cannon with 200 to 260 projectile rounds (sources vary) mounted in a GP-9 gun pack under the fuselage. Six total hardpoints allowed for up to 6,600lbs of external stores. Hardpoints included two fuselage stations, two underwing \"glove\" stations and two underwing pylons for the fitting of various air-to-air missile systems. Cleared missile systems eventually included the AA-7 \"Apex\", AA-8 \"Aphid\", AA-10 \"Alamo\", AA-11 \"Archer\" and AA-12 \"Adder\" missiles of differing seeker heads and engagement range. A typical interceptor loadout became 2 x AA-7 \"Apex\"  radar/infra-red and 2 x AA-8 \"Aphid\" short-range infrared missile assortments. In 1974, \"double pylons\" - fitting two missiles to one weapon station - were fitted for increased loadouts.\n\r\nThe resulting expansion of the MiG-23 as a ground attack fighter enabled the type to bring to bear a bevy of conventional drop bombs, napalm, rocket pods and air-to-surface missiles as needed (as well as nuclear-tipped weapons). Further development would create the dedicated MiG-27 series variant.\n\nThe First Floggers\n\r\nEntry of the first MiG-23s into Soviet air service proved somewhat disappointing. The first production variant became the MiG-23S to which its \"S\" designation denoted the use of the new pulse-Doppler \"Sapfir-23\" radar system in the nose. However, delays to the Sapfir radar program caused these Floggers to instead ship with the more primitive RP-22SM \"Jay Bird\" radar systems as found on the MiG-21 \"Fishbeds\". This move, though a necessity, drastically cut down on the usefulness of the new jet as a modern interceptor. This particular MiG-23 model was now incapable of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) actions and was essentially limited against its Western counterparts right out of the gate. It limitations kept the MiG-23S model from ever materializing into a frontline operational fighter.\n\r\nTo counter the deficiencies of the initial MiG-23S production models and its \"Jay Bird\" radar installation, Mikoyan-Gurevich moved quickly to produce the improved MiG-23M (\"M\" signifying its \"modified\" state). The M-model fitted the intended Sapfir radar system when it was finally made available. The new MiG-23 officially made itself the most potent MiG product to date as the Sapfir radar raised  the capabilities of the aircraft and - coupled with the right missile system (this being the AA-7 \"Apex\" air-to-air missile) - could now be considered a feared interceptor capable of matching wits with the best of the West.\n\nFlogger Frenzy\n\r\nAs the only production swing-wing fighter in Soviet service, the MiG-23 was something of a must-have novelty for its allies and supporters. As such, interest was generated from nations wanting the system in their inventories. However, the MiG-23 (in its base production form) was something of a closely-held project for the Soviet Union, being that it utilized sophisticated and sensitive internal systems not meant for public consumption. As such, the MiG-23 had to be developed into simplified (sometimes referred to as \"sanitized\") forms for the sole purpose of export. This often occurred in two distinct forms - one for Warsaw Pact nations and another for \"trusted\" Third World export customers. Warsaw Pact nations were generally given a slightly revised version of the base Soviet models while Third World customers were given downgraded forms featuring simpler radar. Such thinking produced the MiG-23MS and the MiG-23MF export models. \n\r\nSales proved a success and the MiG-23 found its way into the inventories of many-a-nation around the world. When all was said and done, some 5,047 MiG-23s were produced between 1967 through 1984. Foreign operators became Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Czechoslovakia, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, East Germany, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, India (as the Rakshak \"Defender/Protector\"), Iran, Iraq, Libya, Namibia, North Korea, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Yemen, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. Operators were generally concentrated throughout Asia, the Middle East and North Africa (Cuba is of particular note here however, as its proximity to the United States would allow the MiG-23 to reach potential targets in Florida with relative ease).\n\nOther Flogger Users\n\r\nChina received several MiG-23 systems from Egypt and - in true Chinese fashion - attempted a program to reverse-engineer the aircraft for their own needs. The program itself proved something of a failure though lessons learned in the process lent themselves quite well to other forthcoming projects. Israel obtained a MiG-21 of Syrian origin via a pilot defection. After evaluation, this MiG-23 eventually became a \"trophy\" outside Hatzerim Airbase. Other Egyptian MiG-23s found their way to the United States via the Foreign Material Acquisition/Exploitation program. These were studied extensively and ultimately featured in war games with the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Tonopah, serving under the American designation of YF-113 well into the 1980s.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 (Flogger)", "aircraft_type": "Swing-Wing Fighter-Interceptor Aircraft"}, {"id": "ae5f9754-21cd-4bf2-a741-ef958025ee37", "year_model": "1970", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Mach 2-capable Sukhoi Su-17 \"Fitter\" was a further development of the successful Su-7 \"Fitter-A\" fighter/fighter-bomber family line detailed elsewhere on this site. The aircraft incorporated a partial variable geometry wing (\"swing wing\") system and improved upon the former's take-off and landing attributes as well as performance at the low-level as required of it during ground attack runs. The swing-wing element added to the aircraft's stability at low-speeds and altitudes while improving overall range and ordnance loads by featuring large-area fixed wing \"gloves\". Beyond its new wing arrangement, the Su-17 also differed from its Su-7 origins in that it featured a newly-designed canopy and nose assembly as well as an identifiable raised fuselage spine, giving the new aircraft a more stout appearance than the pencil-thin Fitter-A. The type served the Soviet Union well and was heavily exported to Warsaw Pact nations and trusted Third World allies alike. The Su-17 was developed into the export Su-20 and Su-22 Fitter models of varying avionics, engines and weapons. In all, some 2,867 Su-17/Su-20/Su-22 Fitters were produced with almost half of these made available to Soviet export customers. Over a dozen nations took delivery of the type, making it a staple fighter-bomber throughout the Cold War. Some air forces continue to fly the aircraft - nearly forty years after it was introduced.\n\nDevelopment - Fitter-B\n\r\nThe Su-7 (NATO codename of \"Fitter-A\") was a capable aircraft in its own right. However, there were glaring deficiencies in its operational range - no thanks to a thirsty powerplant - and ordnance-carrying capabilities. Sukhoi and Soviet authorities sought other improvements that would make the Fitter series a much more capable and versatile battlefield component. As such, a Su-7BM production model served as the demonstrator for the testing of a new swing-wing variable geometry system development. The new wing would essentially be made up of two parts - a fixed wing root/wing glove and the positional swing-wing portion making up half of the wing (at about mid-wing span). The new prototype became the Su-7IG (\"IG\" for \"Izmenyaemaya Geometriya\", also internal designation of \"S-22I\").  First flight was achieved on August 2nd, 1966. The working prototype/technology demonstrator showed enough promise during this testing phase, improving on both field performance and range of the Su-7, that it was selected for production.\n\r\nA two-seat Su-7U long-fuselage trainer was then revised. The rear instructor's cockpit would make way for additional avionics and fuel while housing the new wing component. The swing-wing configuration was devised as a way to increase the Su-7's inherent range while at the same time allowing the aircraft to carry more weaponry along its fixed wing portion without the need to implement heavy and complex swiveling weapon stations to maintain aerodynamic integrity in full sweep. A limited production run appeared under the base \"Su-17\" designation, these being fitted with the Lyulka AL-7F-1 turbojet powerplant of 22,046lbs thrust. Production of this early Fitter-B would run from 1969 to 1973. \n\r\nThe Su-17K became the export version of this base Su-17, though this was only received by the Egyptian Air Force. NATO assigned the new aircraft design the codename of \"Fitter-B\", sequentially relating this new design with that of the original Su-7 it originated from.\n\nThe Rest of the Su-17 Fitter Variants - Beginning with Fitter-C\n\r\nThe Su-17M (S-32M) became the first quantitative production version of note and was known to NATO as \"Fitter-C\".  The aircraft was fitted with an afterburning Lyulka AL-21F-3 engine of 24,800lbs output and was given an onboard SRD-5M range-finding radar (same as the one found on the Su-7BMK production models). A new navigation and attack system was installed for her intended ground attack role. The fuselage was also given a pair of forward-mounted pitot pressure measurement tubes. An Angle-of-Attack (AoA) vane was affixed as was a rear brake parachute, the latter promoting shorter landing runs. First flight was achieved on December 28th, 1971. In addition to her primary battlefield roles, some Su-17s were developed into a  limited-production - though still capable - reconnaissance variant under the Su-17R designation featuring reconnaissance pods with applicable equipment. Production of the improved Fitter-C began in 1972 with official introduction occurring in 1973. Production ceased in 1975.\n\r\nThe export version of this ground attack model became the Su-20. The prototype Su-20 first flew on December 15th, 1972. Egypt, Poland and Syria were the primary export customers of this new aircraft. The Su-20R was the export reconnaissance equivalent of the base Su-20 line.\n\nFitter-D\n\r\nThe Su-17M2 was the next definitive development and was assigned the NATO codename of \"Fitter-D\". She was essentially an improved production form of the former types and was known internally at Sukhoi as S-32M2. The nose assembly was extended by 15 inches and revised to incorporate more of a downward slope to improve the pilot's \"out-of-the-cockpit\" forward visibility - a plus in the low-level strike role. This new Fitter also deleted the ranging radar but incorporated the Fon-1400 laser rangefinder as well as additional combat-related avionics. A DISS-7 Doppler navigation radar was installed into a fairing under the nose and first flight of the aircraft was achieved on December 20th, 1973. Production began in 1974, lasting until 1977, and the Su-17M2 officially entered Soviet service in 1975. The Su-17M2 featured a fixed shock cone.\n\r\nThe Su-17M2D was another Fitter-D development but fitted with a Tumansky R-29BS-300 series engine of 25,335lbf with afterburning in a revised rear fuselage (this being a defining feature of the variant) and shorter overall fuselage. The engine offered little in the way of improved performance and limited range so was therefore only offered in forthcoming export deliveries. First flight was achieved on January 31st, 1975 and production lasted from 1977 to 1978.\n\nFitter-E - the Trainer\n\r\nThe Su-17UM was the two-seat trainer form developed from the S-52U prototype and given the NATO codename of \"Fitter-E\". Production began in 1976, with the aircraft entering service that same year. Production lasted until 1978. This new aircraft featured a deeper revised airframe to make room for the addition of the second cockpit for the instructor. This also resulted in the deletion of some internal fuel space thus limiting the aircraft's range. The original avionics of the production model were maintained while the portside cannon was omitted. The vertical tail fin was enlarged to counteract the effects of longitudinal instability (when in a high AoA). First flight was achieved on August 15th, 1975. \n\r\nThe two-seat Su-17UM went under the export designation of Su-22U and fitted a Tumansky R-29 series powerplant.\n\nFitter-F\n\r\nThe Su-17M2D export model became the Su-22 which fell under the internal Sukhoi designation of S-32M2K. The Su-22 was afforded the same K-36D ejection seat system as found on the modern-day MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" and Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" jet aircraft series and was powered by a Tumansky R-29 engine. The Su-22 also featured a fixed shock cone, laser rangefinder and Doppler radar.\n\nFitter-G\n\r\nThe Lyulka-powered Su-17UM3 (S-52UM3, NATO codename of \"Fitter-G\") was a revised conversion trainer with the deeper fuselage and revised vertical tail fin. It fitted the avionics suite of the Su-17M3 and achieved first flight on September 21st, 1978. Production lasted from 1978 until 1982.\n\r\nThe export form was offered as the Su-22UM3 and the Su-22UM-3K, each differing by their use of the Tumansky R-29 and Lyulkin AL-21 series engines respectively. \n\nFitter-H\n\r\nThe Su-17UM two-seat trainer airframe was also used in the development of the S-52, becoming the Su-17M3 (\"Fitter-H\"). The instructor's cockpit position was naturally removed and made way for additional avionics and fuel stores, the latter benefitting range. The external Doppler radar fairing was moved into an internal position and provision for AA-2 \"Atoll and AA-8 \"Aphid\" along two hardpoints under the wing gloves were added. First flight was achieved on June 30th, 1976. Production lasted from 1976 until 1981. The Su-17M3 (and its related export derivatives) model became the most quantitative Su-17 Fitter development of the series, numbering nearly 1,000 production examples in whole.\n\nFitter-J\n\r\nA downgraded export version of the Su-17M3 became the Su-22M (\"Fitter-J\", S-52K internal Sukhoi designation). The prototype Su-22M was first flown on May 24th, 1977 with production beginning in 1978 and lasting to 1984. An upgraded export version fell under the designation of Su-22M3 (internal designation of S-52MK).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sukhoi Su-17 / Su-20 / Su-22 (Fitter)", "aircraft_type": "Ground Attack / Strike Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "84ce07db-5e48-48de-bffa-37d2c171afcc", "year_model": "1969", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-26 was developed from the An-24 of 1962 for the airliner passenger / general transport role.

A plethora of variants then emerged and operators have ranged the globe with many airframes still in active service today (2014).\n\r\nThe original An-24 proved a design that was robust for the most harshest of conditions available across the vast Soviet empire - particularly in hard to reach areas of the frontier where few services were available. This propelled a new, modified form to gain traction, one in particular that included a powered loading ramp for ease of moving cargo pallets to and from the aircraft to awaiting bays or transport trucks. With a new ramp design finishing its testing phase, the installation commenced to produce the new working designation of An-26.\n\r\nAs finalized, the An-26 carried over much of the same form and function of the preceding An-24 model including its high-wing design and twin engine layout. The tail unit remained a single vertical fin with low-set horizontal planes. The flight deck was held at the extreme front end of the fuselage aft of a short nose cone. The cargo hold then made up a bulk of the available internal space remaining. Initial production models were recognized simply as \"An-26\" and were identified in NATO nomenclature as \"Curl-A\". A combo passenger/cargo-hauler form then became the An-26-100. The local Chinese variant became the Xian Y-7H military transport.\n\r\nOther limited production variants followed including an Arctic reconnaissance platform with special mission equipment, an atmospheric air lab, an assault transport prototype, various testbeds, a fire-fighting platform, and other proposed (some unrealized) designs.\n\r\nOperators have gone on to range from Angola and Belarus to Yemen and Zambia. Many military operators have since abandoned the type including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Poland, and Somalia. The United States operated An-26s through the 6th Special Operations Squadron of the United States Air Force from the period of 2003 to 2007.

Production spanned from 1957 until 1985. The Ilyushin IL-38 is an offshoot of the IL-18 design.\n\r\nThe IL-20 recorded a first-flight in March of 1968.\n\r\nThe IL-20 (also the IL-18D-36 \"Bizon\") was eventually developed into the primary IL-20M (\"Coot-A\") variant serving in the ELectronic signals INTelligence (ELINT) role.

A wheeled, retractable tricycle undercarriage is used for ground-running. With the same inherent power from the 4 x Ivchenko AI-20M turboprop engines, the aircraft has excellent range for its class - a much needed quality for an on-station aircraft in the ELINT role.\n\r\nKey physical features of the IL-20 not seen in a typical IL-18 is the long radar array (side-looking) mounted ventrally (under the belly of the aircraft) and dorsal and fuselage-side-mounted blisters signifying sensors and the like.\n\r\nBeyond the base IL-20M is the IL-20RT.

The design was based on the framework established by the earlier Antonov An-24 airliner of 1962. A first-flight, by way of prototype, was had on August 21st, 1967 and service introduction began in July 1968. From the period of 1971 to 1980, some 123 were built covering both civilian and military operators from Bulgaria and China to the Soviet Union and Vietnam.\n\r\nThe An-30 was known to NATO under the codename of \"Clank\".\n\r\nDesign-wise the An-30 retained much of the form and function of the An-24 that it was originated from. The nose section was obviously reworked for the new role but the aircraft carried a high-wing mainplane arrangement, each seating a turboprop engine at the leading edges. The fuselage was tubular and tapered noticeably at the rear to which a single vertical fin was mounted with low-set horizontal stabilizers. The undercarriage was of a tricycle arrangement and fully-retractable.\n\r\nAs built, the An-30 featured a crew of seven and a length of 79.6 feet, a wingspan of 95.9 feet and a height of 27.2 feet. Empty weight was 34,400 lb against an MTOW of 50,705lb. Power was from 2 x ZMKB Progress AI-24T turboprop engines developing 2,803 horsepower each. Maximum speed reached 335 miles per hour with a cruising speed of 265mph. Range was out to 1,635 miles and the aircraft's service ceiling was 27,230 feet.\n\r\nThe An-24FK served as the only prototype of the An-30's development and this was based on the existing An-24B with a slightly elevated flight deck and navigator's position in the glazed-over nose section. The An-30A was the first in-service production form and introduced into the civilian market through the Ministry of Civil Aviation (Soviet). Some of the stock was also sold off to export customers. The An-30B was the follow-up, militarized model for service in the Soviet Air Force and differed in its avionics suite. Later versions also had countermeasures kits fitted.\n\r\nThe An-30D \"Sibiryak\" was a long-range development of the An-30A production model. The aircraft were given increased range through larger fuel stores and were equipped with more modern and mission-specific systems. These served in the civilian market.\n\r\nThe An-30FG was a one-off Czech Air Force An-30 which carried Western radar. The An-30M \"Meteozashchita\" was a weather research platform. The An-30R became an NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) reconnaissance platform for Soviet Air Force service. This mark served handily in the Chernobyl crisis of 1986.\n\r\nThe An-30 series serves in a limited capacity today (2017) with civil operator Aero-Fret in the Congo and Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and Ukraine being the only known military operators.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-30 (Clank)", "aircraft_type": "Transport / Reconnaissance Aircraft"}, {"id": "a9afb720-6500-4849-b143-6d537d925715", "year_model": "1968", "description": "\r\n        \tDespite its entry into service back in 1968 (with air carrier Lufthansa), the Boeing Model 737 continues to fly high today (2018). Over 10,000 aircraft in the series have been built (March 2018) with production running from 1966 to the present day. The success of the model has led to a bevy of variants being realized that includes several military platforms for various global services (including the United States). At one point in its career, the Model 737 marked the world's best-selling airliner - a reason why it continues in widespread service today (2018).\n\r\nThe Model 737 was originally developed as a narrow-body passenger-hauler for the short-to-medium-ranged airliner market. Born from the framework of the Model 707 and Model 727, the Model 737 was intended to provide Boeing with the ability to offer a reliable, moderate-cost performer at every level of global interest. Engineers developed a conventional, tube-shaped passenger-hauler with low-mounted wing mainplanes, tricycle landing gear, and a single-finned tail unit. Each mainplane sported an underslung engine nacelle designed to give the aircraft the necessary range, power, and performance for the short-to-medium-range marketplace. For its construction, the Model 737 relied on up to 60% commonality of parts between its sister design - the Model 727.\n\r\nA first-flight of a Model 737 prototype was recorded on April 9th, 1967 and, following the requisite certifications period, the type was introduced with West Germany's air carrier Lufthansa on February 10th, 1968. The initial production model became the Model 737-100 with, as its designation suggests, seated up to 100 passengers. This entry was unveiled in February of 1965. Production was limited to just 30 airframes before attention turned to the dimensionally larger, stretched Model 737-200.\n\r\nThe 737-100 carried 2 x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-5, D-7, D-9, or D-17 engines varying in thrust from 14,000lb to 16,400lb each unit. The 737-200 also carried this engine.\n\r\nThe Model 737-200 was also unveiled back in 1965 and followed into service in April of 1968 with carrier United Airlines. The Model 737-200 \"Advanced\" became an improved form of the base 737-200 offering. This model was launched with Japan's All Nippon Airways in May of 1971 and sported uprated engines, increased fuel capacity and operational ranges, and automatic wheel braking systems among other qualities. Another model in this series was the 737-200C (Cargo) which added a dual (\"combi\") functionality - the aircraft serving passengers and cargo as needed by the operator. The United States Air Force (USAF) took on a stock of 19 Model 737-200 as well, designated as \"T-43\" and used in the aviation navigation role. An offshoot of this model was the \"CT-43\" which proved useful in USAF passenger hauling routes. The \"NT-43A\" was a one-off test bed for various radar fits.\n\r\nThe Model 737 \"Classic\" covered the 737-300, 737-400, and 737-500 series - second-generation forms of the Model 737. The line was established after the arrival of the 737-600, 737-700, 737-800, and 737-900 series. Nearly 2,000 aircraft were produced of all types from 1984 into 2000.\n\r\nThe 737-300, -400, and -500 all carried the CFM56-3 turbofan engine of 20,000 to 23,500lb thrust each unit. The 737-600, -700, -800, and -900 series were all given the CFM56-7 turbofan engine of 20,000lb to 27,000lb thrust output (each).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Boeing 737 (Series)", "aircraft_type": "Short-to-Medium Range Passenger Airliner / Freighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "edf6b41d-d8b8-4a2e-b35a-59a0c4d02186", "year_model": "1968", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Ilyushin IL-38 (NATO codename of \"May\") is a maritime patrol and anti-submarine platform utilized solely by the navies of Russia and India. The IL-38 is a militarized development of the IL-18, a civil passenger airliner produced by the same Soviet state bureau. Besides her similar outward appearance to the IL-18, the IL-38 shares only a few key features with the original civil airliner - the most notable of these being the turboprop engines. Additionally, the IL-38 fields a revised nose assembly making her some 13 feet, 1.5 inches longer than the IL-18. The wings have also been relocated forward along the fuselage to compensate for the added mission equipment weight and adjusted center of gravity and the cabin windows prevalent in the civilian model have been reduced in number for the IL-38. As such, the IL-38 is generally regarded as a \"new-build\" aircraft through-and-through and implementation of specialized onboard systems justify its dedicated role.\n\r\nA prototype version was first flown on September 28th, 1961. By 1967, the aircraft had entered production under the designation of \"IL-38\". The aircraft was a regular performer within the inventory of the then-Soviet Naval Aviation service until the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, the IL-38 has operated under the banner of the resurging Russian Naval Aviation service. Since production of the IL-38 completed in 1972, its primary roles have been gradually replaced by the more powerful and long-range four-engine Tupolev Tu-142 (\"Bear\"). Despite the appearance of the Bear series, the IL-38 still maintains operational value to the Russian Navy even today. Some 57 IL-38 examples are believed to have been produced for the Soviet/Russian Navy with a further 5 delivered to India.\n\r\nThe aircraft sported a smooth cylindrical fuselage and definite streamlined shape. The cockpit was held well-forward in the design, fitted just aft of the nose cone. Under the nose cone assembly lay the weather radar. Located just aft and below the cockpit flight deck was the Berkut (meaning \"Golden Eagle\" and known as \"Wet Eye\" to NATO) search radar fitted into a noticeable fuselage blister. Wings were low-mounted monoplanes set ahead of amidships. The engines - four in number - sat within slender streamlined nacelles jutting out from each wing leading edge (two engines to a wing). The empennage was more or less conventional with its tall vertical tail fin. Horizontal stabilizers were fitted slightly aft of the tail fin. Between the horizontal stabilizers and under the tail fin lay a boom housing the Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD). Mission ordnance was held within two internal bomb bays - one arranged forward of the wing assemblies to house sonobouys and the other aft to house the weapons proper. A rear starboard side cabin door was the method of entry and exit for the crew. The undercarriage was a conventional tricycle arrangement featuring a pair of four-wheeled main landing gear legs and a two-wheeled nose landing gear leg. The standard operating crew consisted of nine or ten personnel to include the two pilots, a flight engineer, sensor operators, MAD operator, tactical coordinator and applicable mission observers.\n\r\nPower for the IL-38 was delivered through two sets of ZMKB Progress (Ivchenko) AI-20M turboprop engines, each delivering upwards of 4,250 horsepower and fitting four blade propellers. This supplied the IL-38 with a maximum speed between 380 and 400 miles per hour and a range between 4,400 and 6,000 miles for an operational endurance nearing 12 hours of consistent flight time. Service ceiling was listed at approximately 32,800 feet with a rate-of-climb equaling 1,050 feet per minute. Empty weight was in the vicinity of 74,000lbs with a maximum take-off weight near 140,000lbs. Up to 20,000lbs of external and internal stores can be carried aloft, this in the form of depth charges (nuclear and conventional), mines, conventional drop bombs and air-launched torpedoes. This variety of weaponry - coupled with the onboard sensor, tracking and targeting systems- allow the IL-38 to attack various forms of enemy surface and submarine vessels.\n\r\nDespite the wide-spanning reach of the communism sphere of influence throughout the Cold War, only India became a foreign operator of the IL-38 and received at least five examples between 1975 and 1983 to be stationed from Goa-Dablomin. As in the Soviet/Russian Navy, the IL-38 served the Indian Navy and differed only in the implementation of the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile system. The Indian IL-38s were at one point flown back to Russia for modernization and upgrading of key systems and are since returning to Indian service (as of this writing) under the new designation of IL-38 SD to indicate the applied changes.\n\r\nBeyond her inherent anti-submarine and maritime patrol roles, the IL-38 airframe has proven suitable for a few notable conversions - namely an ELINT (ELectronic INTelligence) model, airborne command post, VIP transport and a dedicated general transport variant.\n\r\nOn September 10th, 2010, it was reported in the American media that an IL-38 flew several close routes near the guided-missile frigate USS Taylor in the Barents Sea, coming as close as 50 yards from the vessel's side. The incident was followed the next day by a visit from a Helix anti-submarine helicopter. Such confrontations have always been common between American naval forces and Russian aircraft since the days of the Cold War. These incidents are usually a show of force or exercises completed by either party and rarely lead to any direct military confrontations.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-38 (May)", "aircraft_type": "Anti-Submarine Maritime Patrol Aircraft"}, {"id": "6915c09a-3a53-4f71-8ef4-8b4fdc1922dd", "year_model": "1968", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Yakovlev Yak-40 (Codling) is a Soviet Cold War-era triple-engine regional passenger airliner.

The type was produced in 1,011 examples and operate across many Soviet-aligned nations (in both military and civilian market guises) including Afghanistan, Albania, Czechoslovakia, and Ukraine. While production ceased in 1981, the series continues to fly today (2021) - a total of about 130 examples were exported.\n\r\nIts design is conventional as triple-engine airliners go: the engines are set at the rear along the fuselage sides and dorsal fuselage line, reducing cabin noise to some extent. The mainplanes are mounted low and at about midships though not swept back, featuring slight dihedral (upward angle). The tail unit incorporates the proven T-style plane arrangement which seats the horizontal plane high atop the vertical fin. At the base of the fin is the dorsal engine housing. The cockpit is set at the front of the fuselage in the usual way with crew seating in side-by-side format and a short, sloping nosecone for good vision forwards. Each crewman (pilot and co-pilot) is given a control yoke and foot pedals for redundancy with throttle controls handily centered at the shared console separating the two seats. A tricycle undercarriage is provided for ground running and is completely retractable in the design.\n\r\nInitial production models were designated simply as Yak-40 while a military conversion variant followed as the Yak-40-25 incorporating the nose of a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25R and used in the ELINT role. Another military form became the Yak-40 \"Akva\" which incorporated a probe at the nose assembly and included a bevy of sensors and specialized equipment. The Yak-40 \"Fobos\" was another military mark with side viewing domes. The Yak-40 \"Kalibrovshchik\" was a modified ELINT model while the Yak-40L was proposed as a swept-wing form with 2 x Lycoming LF507-1N turbofan engines (in a partnership with Textron and Skorost). The Yak-40 \"Liros\" became another military offering and outfitted with sensors and specialized equipment. The Yak-40 \"Meteo\" was another military market form and featured dipole antenna and the military-minded Yak-40REO included IR linescan equipment and a viewing dome at the starboard side of the fuselage. The Yak-40 \"Shtorm\" military variant was identified through its added external probes and carried additional sensors and equipment.\n\r\nThe Yak-40 M-602 was evolved to become a flying testbed and data collection platform - notable for its M-602 propeller unit installed at the nose cone (this version continues to fly for Russia today). An extended range variant became the Yak-40D \"Dal-niy\" and the Yak-30EC marked export forms. The Yak-40K was a cargo-hauling conversion variant incorporating a cargo door.\n\r\nThe Yak-40M was a proposed mark with lengthened fuselage to carry up to 40 passengers. The Yak-40P added enlarged engine nacelles. The Yak-40TL was another proposed, modernized model to be powered by 3 x AI-25T turbofan engines. The Yak-40MS was an experimental form sporting 2 x Honeywell TFE731-5 series turbofan engines. The STR-40DT mark identified a proposed version to feature a composite wing.\n\r\nThe original Yak-40 was operated by a standard crew of three that included a flight mechanic. Up to 32 passengers could be carried. Overall length reached 66.9 feet with a wingspan of 82 feet and a total height of 21.3 feet. Empty weight was 20,723lb against an MTOW of 34,172lb. The engine arrangement involved 3 x Ivchenko AI-25 non-afterburning turbofan engines, each delivering around 3,300lb of thrust.\n\r\nMaximum speed was Mach 0.7 with cruising done around 340 miles-per-hour. Range was out to 1,100 miles and its service ceiling reached 26,000 feet (requiring cabin pressurization). Rate-of-climb was 1,575 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe Yakovlev Yak-42 (\"Clobber\") is a related development of the Yak-40 series, also relying on a triple engine arrangement and featuring many qualities of the original (the notable exception being swept-back wing mainplanes).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-40 (Codling)", "aircraft_type": "Triple-Engine Regional Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "66d612ae-0900-4030-8f78-c6313e655fe1", "year_model": "1967", "description": "\r\n        \tShowcasing one of the largest armies in the world during the Cold War (1947-1991), the Soviet military required many large transport-minded aircraft for airlifting men, machines and supplies. Its stable of such aircraft eventually included the Antonov An-22 \"Antei\" for heavy strategic airlifting. The product became the largest aircraft in the world to feature turboprop engines and was produced in 68 examples from the period spanning 1966 into 1976. The An-22 remains in active service today (2017).\n\r\nIts name is derived from the Greek mythology character of \"Antaeus\", the son of Poseidon.\n\r\nThe An-22 first flew in prototype form on February 27th, 1965 and, following the requisite testing scheme and earning certification, the product was introduced a short time late in 1967. To this point, the Military Transport Aviation service of the Soviet Air Force was relying on An-8 and An-12 models which fulfilled medium-lift roles and a larger transport was required.\n\r\nThe Antonov Design Bureau was charged with design and development of a shoulder-winged, multi-engined aircraft and this begat the designation of \"An-20\". The product eventually evolved under the well-known An-22 designation by the time it reached its first flight. During the 1965 Paris Air Show, the An-22 was unveiled to the public for the first time, allowing Western observers a first-hand look at the large aircraft.\n\r\nAntonov engineers created a unique-looking aircraft, though in many ways decidedly an Antonov design. The fuselage was tubular though squat, creating the wide-body internal volume required in the transport role. Bulges along the lower fuselage sides housed an array of landing wheels to coincide with the nose gear (also designed with rough-field operations in mind). The aircraft was purposefully low to the ground when landed which aided in loading and unloading cargo. The high-wing nature of the aircraft also allowed for strong lift principles and clearance of the spinning propeller blades away from ground personnel. Each wing managed a pair of turboprop engines at their leading edges. The cockpit was set well-forward in the design with a commanding view over the short nose assembly. The empennage was raised and capped by a split-rudder arrangement. The operating crew numbered. Dimensions included a length of 190 feet, a wingspan of 211 feet and a height of 41 feet.

It has seen use as a passenger transport, troop transport, vip transport, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, assault, artillery spotter and airborne command post throughout its tenure with the various nations that have purchased the aircraft. Even today, the Mi-8 remains in use as an operational-level instrument in many of the air forces and army groups that have seen value in the type. As of this writing, production continues despite some 42 years since the first Mi-8 rolled off of the assembly lines at the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant - then  under the Soviet banner.\n\r\nThe Mi-8 was developed as a replacement for the Mi-4 \"Hound\", a piston-engined transport helicopter appearing in 1953 that could seat up to fourteen personnel. Utilizing some of the successful internal workings of the Mi-4, the new Mil design featured a single Soloviev turboshaft engine of 2,700 shaft horsepower mated to an all-new enlarged fuselage. The prototype took on the name of Mi-8 (\"Hip-A\") and achieved first flight on July 9th, 1961. Follow-up developmental testing soon revealed the design to lack in power and, as such, the single engine idea was dropped in favor of a twin-engined design featuring two Isotov TV2 turboshaft engines. A five-blade main rotor was also used in this revision which produced the second prototype, first flying on September 17th, 1962. Minor revisions followed and the Mi-8 was fully introduced in Soviet Air Force service sometime in 1967. The initial production versions all fell under the NATO designation of \"Hip-C\" and constituted the base militarized model and a civilian model (noted for its square windows instead of round). Since then, the Hip series has been expanded to include a plethora of upgraded and specially-designed versions.\n\r\nExternally, the Mi-8 maintains a most utilitarian look about her.

One product of the time became the Tu-134, known to NATO under the codename of \"Crusty\", which has operated for decades since its introduction in 1967. The type went on to see considerable service in both military and civilian roles, such was its versatility, with examples still in active service today (2018) with a few users. At peak usage, the Tu-134 could claim many operators in some forty-plus countries worldwide.\n\r\nThe Tu-134's development was spurred by the French advancement of relocating an aircraft's primary propulsion away from wing mainplanes and onto the aft section of the fuselage. This had an effect on two key qualities of a passenger-minded aircraft - it reduced cabin noise by keeping the engines further away from the passenger center and it reduced over-under drag at the wing mainplanes. Large Soviet airplane-maker, Tupolev - primarily recognized for their contributions to the military bomber category, was commissioned by the Soviet government to produce a similar design to the ground-breaking Sud Aviation \"Caravelle\" and thus began the story of the Tu-134. The new aircraft would be used to begin succeeding the line of aged and outdated prop-driven passenger types then in Soviet service with its primary market being short-ranged routes across the Soviet sphere of influence - including East Germany.\n\r\nTupolev responded with a prototype form, the Tu-124A, that first-flew on July 29th, 1963. The aircraft carried swept planes at both the main and tail members. The engines were mounted on short wing stubs located along the aft-end of the fuselage and the mainplanes (swept back at some 35-degree angles) were low-mounted at midships. The cockpit was set aft of a short nosecone in the usual way (with side-by-side seating for its two pilots) and the aircraft was given a \"T-style\" tail arrangement which set the horizontal planes high about its design while the support structure was the vertical fin itself. A tricycle undercarriage was used for ground-running and, interestingly enough, a brake parachute was used to retard the aircraft's run down the runway upon landing (this was later succeeded by more conventional thrust reversers when these were added to the D-30 engines in future models).

The series was developed from the earlier single-engined DHC-3 \"Otter\" (detailed elsewhere on this site) which arrived in 1953 and has managed to maintain an active presence in the skies today (2018) - the aircraft itself a further development of the earlier DHC-2 \"Beaver\" (also detailed elsewhere on this site). The DHC-6 remains in production with operators ranging from Algeria and Australia to Venezuela and Yemen - both at the civilian and military market levels.\n\r\nThe Twin Otter makes use of shoulder-mounted, fuselage-braced wings to achieve lift in short order. To each wing mainplane member is fitted a powerful Pratt & Whitney Canada turboprop engine given excellent ground clearance for their spinning propeller blades. The cockpit, seating two side-by-side, is positioned overlooking the nose in the usual way and offers the crew excellent vision of the surrounding / upcoming terrain. The fuselage is slab-sided and incorporates the passenger cabin lined with windows. The empennage tapers ever-so-slightly and is capped by a single vertical fin with mid-mounted horizontal planes. A fixed tricycle undercarriage is used for ground running and also provides strong rough-field performance, allowing the Twin Otter to be a very versatile machine (landing on dirt airfields, sand and the like). Other forms substitute the wheeled undercarriage with twin floats to allow for operations on water (take-off / landing) allowing the aircraft to be operated nearly anywhere in the world.\n\r\nWork on what was to become the Twin Otter began in 1964 as de Havilland Canada looked for a successor to its own DHC-3. The DHC-3 framework and proven pedigree were used in the general make-up of the newer DHC-6 and a first-flight in prototype form was recorded on May 20th, 1965. A key difference between the DHC-3 and the DHC-6 became the latter's wing-mounted twin turboprop engine arrangement - whereas the DHC-3 only fitted a single engine in its nose.\n\r\nSix aircraft were constructed for the trials program under the \"Series 1\" designation and, with the seventh aircraft onwards, production ensued in 1965. These examples were known as \"Series 100\" aircraft and 108 examples were completed, powered by 2 x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A20 turboprops.

The Ka-25 became a mainstay on Soviet surface warships throughout the Cold War and played a major role in anti-submarine warfare for decades. The aircraft has since been replaced in service by the more capable Ka-32 series - another Kamov design.\n\r\nThe Kamov Ka-25 is a highly-recognizable helicopter for many reasons. Most notably are the twin main rotors, coaxially mounted and negating the need for a tail rotor. The elimination of the tail rotor, commonly found on traditional helicopters, means that the Ka-25 can be built to a shorter-in-length specification - a priceless attribute when considering onboard storage for a navy warship. Additionally, the stout fuselage design and tri-fin tail section are clear indicators of a Kamov design. This basic appearance is carried on in the Ka-27, Ka-28, Ka-29, Ka-31 and the Ka-32.\n\r\nCrew accommodations amount to a pilot and copilot seated at front, side-by-side. if properly equipped, the cabin can provide seating for up to 12 passengers. Traditionally, the system is designed for naval operations in the way of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and search and rescue (SAR) operations, meaning cabin space is utilized for specialized equipment. Armament can vary depending on the mission but traditionally, the Ka-25 is set up to take on two air-to-surface torpedoes and/or conventional and nuclear depth charges.\n\r\nNo fewer than 450 Ka-25's were produced and delivered to the Soviet Union and Ukraine along with India and Syria. The type has slowly been removed from frontline service in the Russian Navy though it may continue in some quantity with other navies. The Ka-25BSh represents the dedicated ASW variant and the Ka-25PS represents the dedicated SAR variant of the Hormone brand.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Kamov Ka-25 (Hormone)", "aircraft_type": "Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Helicopter"}, {"id": "4fd1f786-f39a-49ee-97e2-a06d31896d04", "year_model": "1965", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet helicopter industry began with the introduction of the Mil Mi-1, a simple, single engine development which appeared in 1950 and was followed in production by 2,594 examples into 1965. The next logical step in its development was the Mil Mi-2 which emerged from PZL-Swidnik of Poland in 1965. A prototype achieved first-flight in 1961 and, from there, 5,497 examples followed. It became known to NATO as \"Hoplite\".\n\r\nThe Mi-2 was larger than its predecessor and fitted two engines over its cabin. It relied on a three-point, fixed, wheeled undercarriage and could be operated by a single crewman. The cabin provided seating for up to eight passengers and could relatively easily be converted to the cargo transport role. Such was the versatility of this product that some air services of the world armed the type and modified it for other roles such as Search and Rescue (SAR).\n\r\nThe major shift on the Mi-2's design from the preceding Mi-1 was the switch from a radial engine to a turbine which was in line with developments witnessed in the West. This accordingly spurred work on a new Soviet turbine for which to use in an equally-new helicopter design, the engine designated GTD-350 and developed by one S.P. Isotov. The end-result was a more powerful rotary-wing platform which increased performance considerably and allowed a single airframe to undertake multiple roles - and compete with Western developments. The prototype went airborne on September 22nd, 1961 as the \"V-2\" and armaments trials were eventually had through the \"V-2V\" prototype that followed.\n\r\nEarly production forms were the Mi-2 \"Platan\", a minelaying platform, the Mi-2A and the upgraded Mi-2B (the latter intended for the export market). The Mi-2Ch \"Chekla\" became a smokescreener / chemical reconnaissance model and the Mi-2D \"Przetacznik\" an airborne command post with applicable equipment installed. The Mi-2FM was developed for surveying and the Mi-2P was used in the commercial passenger / cargo hauling roles. The Mi-2R became a mainstay in agriculture and the Mi-2RL was outfitted for the rescue / MEDEVAC role. Its maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) counterpart was the Mi-2RM. The Mi-2Ro was used in the reconnaissance role and a reconnaissance trainer became the UMi-2Ro.\n\r\nThe Mi-2RS \"Padalec\" was specifically developed for the chemical / biohazard reconnaissance role and the Mi-2S was an air ambulance. The Mi-2Sz and Mi-2U marks featured a dual-control scheme for training.\n\r\nMi-2T was modified to carry cargo and could haul up to 1,545lb of internal loads and 1,765lb of externally-slung loads. Performance included a maximum speed of 125 miles per hour, a range of 275 miles and a service ceiling of 13,125 feet. Rate-of-climb reached 885 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe Mi-2US was an armed version sporting a 23mm NS-23 automatic cannon in a fixed, forward-firing mount. it also carried up to 4 x 7.62mm PKT machine guns and could install another PK machine gun at the cabin door.\n\r\nThe Mi-2URP \"Salamandra\" was outfitted for the anti-tank role with the 23mm NS-23 autocannon and 4 x AT-3 \"Sagger\" Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs). The Mi-2URN \"Zmija\" became an armed reconnaissance model with 23mm NS-23 autocannon and 2 x 16-shot S-5 unguided rocket pods. Additional 7.62mm machine guns could also be installed as needed. The Mi-2URP-G \"Gniewosz\" mounted 4 x Strela-2 Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs).\n\r\nThe Mi-2 \"Plus\" was an upgraded Mi-2 model featuring GTD-350W2 series engines. it also incorporated a modernized avionics suite and composite main rotor blades. The Mi-2MSB was a modernized form and passenger hauler for the civilian market. The Mi-2MSB-V was another modernized form, though military in nature, and intended for the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\r\nOperators of the Mi-2 ranged from Algeria and Armenia to the Ukraine and Yugoslavia - many were former Soviet allied nations and states. While many operators have given up on the type, many continue its use including the modern North Korean Air Force.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-2 (Hoplite)", "aircraft_type": "Light Utility / Training Helicopter"}, {"id": "07c13277-9ac9-42ed-abd6-50b6cc5ee91a", "year_model": "1964", "description": "\r\n        \tAfter World War 2 (1939-1945) introduced the turbojet engine as a viable aviation propulsion system, the jet age was born and evolved throughout the 1950s. This period then begat a specialized group of three-engined aircraft recognized as \"trijets\" which gained in popularity during the 1960s. The first such commercial airliner to see service became the famous Boeing 727 model series, beating out the competing British-born Hawker Siddeley \"Trident\" by mere months during 1964. For the first three decades of jet-powered passenger service, the Boeing 727 proved the best-selling product in the world, making a name for itself on all-important short-to-medium-haul routes as a narrow-body, jet-powered airliner. Production of 707s eventually totaled 1,831 units spanning from from 1963 to 1984 to which some have remained in service even today (March 2014), though mainly now reserved as a cargo mover with numbers continuing to dwindle with each passing year.\n\r\nPrior to the 727, Boeing engineers accrued a good deal of experience in designing and developing the preceding four-engined 707 and 720 marks. The three-engined 727 now moved the engine nacelles aft of the main wing appendages (as opposed to underslung) and added the third engine at the base of the tail rudder, streamlining the narrow design considerably. This gave the 727 model a most distinct appearance which made it easily recognizable in the Boeing aircraft stable. First flight of the prototype occurred on February 9th, 1963 and the aircraft was soon in service with Eastern Airlines on February 1st, 1964. It's typical operating crew would number three flight crew and up to four cabin attendants.\n\r\nThe 727 brought about several unique features which gave it excellent \"hot-and-high\" performance as well as short-field qualities, allowing it access to smaller, minor airports all over the world. Its wings incorporated a new leading edge slat design as well featuring triple-slotted trailing edge slats used to provide strong, low speed handling qualities used during take-off and landings. A thrust-reversal feature aided landings on shorter runways while engines were engineered with noise reduction qualities for service at busy civil airports. During its time aloft, the aircraft received favorable reviews from its crews and passengers who appreciated its performance and accessibility. In time, the aircraft also proved a suitable VIP and business jet. The 1,000th aircraft was eventually ordered in September of 1972, marking a product milestone, such was the popularity of the 727 in the airliner market (since surpassed by the upcoming 737 model).\n\r\nThe initial production 727 model became the 727-100 of which some 407 units were delivered by Boeing (though sales initially proved sluggish). The single-class configuration could haul 149 souls while the two-class configuration moved up to 131 persons. The \"Convertible\" then followed as the 727-100C which added a side cargo loading door to access the main deck, broadening the capabilities of the 727 airframe to serve as a cargo hauler, passenger hauler or a mix of the two. Total production of the 727-100C mark was just 164 units however. 727-100s were powered by 3 x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-1 turbofan engines of 14,000lb thrust each.\n\r\nIn December of 1967, the \"stretched\" 727-200 was brought online and proved the classic and hugely popular 727 product model. It incorporated a 20-foot lengthening of the fuselage which improved internal volume while increasing gross weight. With a full passenger load, the aircraft could now carry up to 189 persons, sales eventually proving the modified 727 a commercial success with many foreign parties now entering the fray. The 727-200F became a dedicated \"freighter\" which fitted up to eleven cargo pallets in the hold, this offering adopted by cargo powerhouse FedEx in fifteen examples. Production of all 727-200 marks netted an impressive 1,245 vehicles while power to the model was served through 3 x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9 turbofan engines of 14,500lbs thrust each.\n\r\nBoeing continued evolving their growing 727 product and this dedication produced the 727-200 \"Advanced\" which introduced a wide-body fuselage approach. The design also brought about use of uprated engines and improved hauling capabilities as well as increased operational ranges. The Advanced model was made available from May 1971 onwards and power served through 3 x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17R engines of 17,400lbs thrust each.\n\r\nThe 727 saw service all over the world with operators spanning all continents. Some were also taken into military and government service where their versatility was truly tested over decades of faithful service. Its sheer availability led to it being the host aircraft to some 178 total hijackings during its career as well as involvement in 112 whole-hull-loss incidences which, rather unfortunately, produced 3,783 total fatalities.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Boeing 727", "aircraft_type": "Intermediate Range Passenger Airliner"}, {"id": "22c5db00-5bf5-4aea-ab96-a73c58470fcf", "year_model": "1962", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-24 (NATO codename of \"Coke\") is a Cold War-era twin-turboprop utility aircraft sitll operated by various air powers of the world including the Russian Air Force. Its proven capabilities, and consistent modernization, have kept it at the forefront of the transport world. where its impact has been felt for decades. First flown in prototype form on October 29th, 1959, the aircraft was formally introduced into service in 1962 and was produced from 1959 to 1979 to the tune of some 1,367 examples (though just over 100 are actively operated today - 2020). The line has also been manufactured by ally China as the \"Y-7\" and other variants include the An-26, An-30, and An-32.\n\r\nAn-24s were adopted to succeed an aging line of Ilyushin IL-14 transports introduced back in 1954 (1,348 were produced).\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the An-24 is typical for an aircraft of this class: the cockpit seats two side-by-side aft of a rounded, short nosecone assembly. The fuselage is tubular and capped by a single, large-area rudder fin at rear that sports upward-cranked horizontal planes. The wing mainplanes are shoulder-mounted and each has an underslung engine nacelle providing the necessary power, lift, and drag for Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) actions. The undercarriage is a conventional retractable tricycle configuration with the twin-wheeled main legs recessing into the engine nacelles and the twin-wheeled nose leg retracting under the cockpit floor.\n\r\nThe An-24 differed from earlier Antonov company products in that it was designed and built to stricter military requirements centered on battlefield conditions - in particular operations from makeshift runways / rough fields. Besides being utilized as a military transport, the series was also handed various other roles that included humanitarian assistance, general cargo transportation, and VIP passenger hauling (up to 52 personnel in this role). Other forms were relied upon for the atmospheric reconnaissance role and still others were used to test various engine fits and other technologies in an active airborne setting - such was the aircraft's versatility.\n\r\nAs can be expected, the An-24 was evolved into many variants. \"An-24\" was used to mark the first prototypes. The An-24AT-RD was a transport with turbojet-boosting take-off capabilities. The An-24B seated 50 passengers and used single-slotted flaps while the An-24D was a planned but abandoned long-range passenger hauler. A pair of An-24LR models carried Sideways-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) for ice reconnaissance sorties. The An-24PS was used in the Search and Rescue (SAR) role while the An-24RT became a communications relay platform.\n\r\nThe related An-26 is a tactical transport complete with cargo ramp. The An-30 is used in the photographic-mapping role and carries specialized equipment. The An-32 is the An-26 developed for better handling of extreme weather conditions. The An-34 is the unused designation for the eventual An-24T mark. The An-50 became an abandoned jet-powered project involving the An-24 design fitted with 4 x Ivchenko AI-25 turbofan engines - it was not furthered.\n\r\nThe An-24V production mark was crewed by three and could ferry up to 50 passengers. Overall length reached 77.1 feet with a wingspan of 95.9 feet, and a height of 27.3 feet. Empty weight was 30,000lb against an MTOW of 46,300lb. Power was from 2 x Ivchenko AI-24A turboprop engines developing 2,550 horsepower each driving 4-bladed AV-72 series constant-speed propellers measuring 12.9 feet in diameter.\n\r\nThe aircraft could hope to reach speeds of 280 miles-per-hour out to a range of 1,500 miles (with full payload capacity reached) and its service ceiling topped at 27,600 feet. Rate-of-climb reached 375 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nCurrent (2020) military operators of the An-24 include the North Korean Air Force (one example modified to serve in the Airborne Early Warning - AEW - role), the Russian Air Force and Navy, and the Ukrainian Air Force and Navy. Post operators include Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Iran, Iraq, Poland, Vietnam and others.

For a time, the Mi-6 represented the largest helicopter production airframe in the world and proved to be the fastest such aircraft, netting several world speed records early in her tenure. Her rugged qualities assured her active duty in the far-reaching areas of the Siberian territories and, despite her Cold War roots, she still maintains an active military presence in world air arms - a testament to her design and general usefulness. The Russians retired the type themselves in 2002 as age began creeping into the maintainability and operational costs of this fine rotary aircraft.\n\nOrigins\r\nThe Mi-6 originated in a joint Soviet Air Force/Aeroflot need for a large, heavy-lift transport helicopter system. Truth be told, the requirement was a staggering endeavor but matched carefully by the veteran engineers at Mil. The resulting design produced the mammoth V-6 prototype series. First flight of the V-6 occurred in September of 1957 with test pilot N.B. Leshin at the controls. By capability alone, the V-6 would be able to match the muscle of such fixed-wing, transport mounts as the American Lockheed C-130 Hercules, proving that the V-6 certainly had some \"kick\" to her drive train. Her engine and gearbox components were all large elements making up a most powerful internal lift system. The V-6 ultimately graduated to become a full-production model by 1960 and was showcased in the Soviet inventory under the designation of \"Mi-6\". She quickly garnered the NATO nickname of \"Hook\" for recognition purposes. It was common practice for NATO to assign (sometimes derogatory) codenames for Soviet-originated aircraft. Fighters took on codenames beginning with the letter \"F\"  (as in \"Fishbed\" or \"Fulcrum\") while bombers were given \"B\" names (as in \"Bison\" or \"Bear\"). Helicopters were, therefore, aptly given \"H\" names (as in \"Hind\" or \"Hip\"). The Mi-6 was notable in the annals of Soviet aircraft lore for she became the first turboshaft-powered helicopter to reach both production status and operational service in their ranks. Furthermore, she became the first helicopter anywhere in the world to break 300km/h, setting a speed record in the process.\n\nProduction and Marks\r\nNOTE: Soviet aircraft designations are never as \"clean\" as some might find in Western inventories where \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" models are ever-prevalent. Instead, models are designated moreso by their inherent function and marked in the Russian language so designations never truly fall into a convenient chronological listing (at least to the Western observer). \n\r\nProduction of this massive helicopter ultimately yielded over 925 examples with examples originating from Soviet factories from 1960 into 1981.\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the Mi-6 began as the V-6 prototype model (also known under the formal designation of \"Zavod No.329 Moscow\"). Development culminated in the first production models encompassing the generic \"Mi-6\" designation with these representing the base heavy-lift transport helicopter family. NATO assigned the codename of \"Hook-A\" to the first production series. These were followed by the Mi-6A, a dedicated civilian transport model that offered impressive seating for up to 90 passengers. The dedicated military transport derivative became known as the Mi-6T (also \"Hook-A\" by NATO) and sported seating for up to 70 personnel. \n\r\nOther militarized variants soon followed and included the Mi-6VKP (\"Hook-B\") Airborne Electronic Warfare (AEW) platform and aerial command post (identified by its many antenna), the Mi-6BUS (\"Hook-C\") airborne command post, the Mi-6AYaSh (\"Hook-D\") airborne command post fitting a SLAR (Side-Looking Airborne Radar) system, the Mi-6PP electronic reconnaissance platform (with AWAC detection and jamming systems), the Mi-6PRTBV fuel transport, the Mi-6R radio communications platform, the Mi-6S MEDEVAC (MEDical EVACuation) variant with room for up to 41 medical litters and the Mi-6TZ/Mi-6ATZ fuel transports, these used to refuel both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters (though while on the ground and not in-flight).\n\r\nOf particular note to the Mi-6 variants was the Mi-6M anti-submarine warfare (ASW) platform. This model fitted up to four aerial torpedoes as well as air-to-surface rockets for combating near-surface enemy submarines. The type was further backed by dedicated sub-hunting equipment onboard. Likewise, the militarized Mi-6RVK served as a test-bed for various mobile missile launching systems appearing sometime in 1965.\n\r\nThe Mi-6PS was a specially-modified Search and Rescue (SAR) variant designed to recover the Vostok and Soyuz Soviet space capsules from the sea after re-entry. The Mi-6PSA is thought to be a slightly different version of this modified platform. The Mi-6TP became a convertible hybrid helicopter that could switch from the cargo-transport role to the passenger-transport role with some modification to her cabin.\n\nMi-6 Dimensions and Weights\r\nThe Mil Mi-6 is a dimensionally large rotary-winged vehicle. Including the diameter of themain rotor blades, the helicopter showcases an overall width of 114 feet, 10 inches. Its height is 32 feet, 4 inches and its running length equals 108 feet, 10 inches. When empty, the Mi-6 sports a weight of 60,000lb. With a regular load, it weighs over 89,000lb and can manage a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) equal to 93,000lb as needed. \r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mil Mi-6 (Hook)", "aircraft_type": "Military / Civilian Multirole Helicopter"}, {"id": "f16f7680-7246-4976-b798-051e0e7aae12", "year_model": "1962", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Soviet/Russian Tupolev concern has had a long and established history in developing and producing large bomber-class aircraft for the Soviet/Russian Air Force. The Tu-22 was developed in the latter part of the 1950s and brought online in the early 1960s to provide a far-reaching offensive punch to Soviet Air Force operations. At the time of its inception, the Tu-22 became the Soviet Union's first supersonic bomber aircraft in service. Despite its impressive appearance and technological heavy infrastructure, the Tu-22 failed to live up to expectations seeing only moderate combat service and production numbers not exceeding 311 units. All have since been retired from operational service.\n\nThe Tupolev Tu-16 (\"Badger\")\n\r\nThroughout most of the 1950s, the Soviet Air Force relied on the Tupolev Tu-16 (NATO: \"Badger\") for its strategic bombing role. The type was first introduced in 1954 and built to the tune of 1,500 examples with license-production occurring elsewhere. Global operators were numerous and included Egypt, Georgia, Iraq and the Ukraine as well as the Soviet Union/Russia. The aircraft was fitted with two turbojet engines supplying 21,000lbs of thrust each which allowed for a top speed of 650 miles per hour and a range out to 4,400miles. However, the aircraft managed a history dating back to the early 1950s and was only capable of subsonic speeds.\n\r\nBy this time in the Cold War, Soviet authorities looked for a supersonic solution and authorized development of a successor to the Tu-16. The new aircraft would have strong air defense penetration capabilities and field a comparable payload to the Tu-16 it was to replace. Of course this being the Cold War, provision for nuclear free-fall bombs was also a requirement. Technology finally allowed for better aerodynamics and improved engine output which allowed the initial \"Samolet 105\" prototype by Tupolev to become the \"Samolet 105A\". First flight was recorded on September 7th, 1959 and, after testing and evaluation, the aircraft was adopted into Soviet air service as the Tu-22. The first production run revealed the Tu-22B variant and made public to the world in July of 1961. Upon identifying the new breed, NATO observers assigned the codename of \"Blinder\" the aircraft. Formal entry into Soviet air service occurred sometime in 1962. By the end of production, some 311 Tu-22 Blinder aircraft were delivered with production spanning 1960 to 1969.\n\nTu-22 Blinder Walk-Around\n\r\nDesign of the Tu-22 produced a very elegant shape though utilitarian to the core as in previous Soviet aircraft attempts of the Cold War. This route of simplicity usually led to a very capable and robust aircraft and the Tu-22 was no exception. The fuselage was highly tubular and area-ruled in its shape with a very well-pointed nose cone housing a nav/attack radar suite. The cockpit sat a ways behind the nose cone and was home to three crew to include the pilot, navigator and weapons officer. The pilot sat at the front left with the navigator at his lower right. The weapons officer was situated to the rear of the pilot. A fuselage spine defeated any useful rearwards visibility and the heavily framed cockpit hindered forward and side views to an extent. Wings were well-swept, low-mounted and fitted amidships for the required stability at supersonic speeds. Strakes were noted along the surface of each wing. The empennage the most unique design aspect of the Tu-22 for it was home to the twin turbojet engine nacelles mounted at the base of the single vertical tail fin. This allowed for more internal volume at the wings and fuselage for the carrying of ordnance and fuel. A pair of swept horizontal planes were also noted. The undercarriage consisted of a conventional nose- and main-leg arrangement. An internal weapons bay allowed for the carrying of various munition types. All told, the Tu-22 was a massive aircraft by any regard. All three crew positions featured downward-firing ejection seats.\n\r\nStandard defensive armament for the Tu-22 series was 1 x 23mm AM-23 or R-23 series cannon and this was fitted to a remote-controlled turret to be found in the tail. This weapon placement protected the vulnerable \"six\" of the aircraft and operated by the weapons officer. Offensive firepower was managed through an internal bomb bay buried in the fuselage at amidships and this could range from 24 x FAB-500 series general purpose conventional drop bombs to nuclear bombs as required. Only later production forms managed missile support. The included navigation-attack radar suite allowed for modernized support. Up to 20,000lbs of stores could be taken aloft. In the case of missile support, the Tu-22 was typically fielded with 1 x Kh-22 (AS-4 \"Kitchen\") cruise missile.\n\r\nPower for the Tu-22 was provided for by a pair of Dobrynin RD-7M-2 series turbojet engines. Output was 24,250lbs thrust on dry (each) and up to 36,376lbs of thrust with afterburner (essentially raw fuel pumped into the engine for short bursts of power and, thus, speed). Maximum speed was 938 miles per hour (Mach 1.42) with an operational range of 3,000 miles. The Tu-22 could operate as high as 40,500 feet. Maximum take-off weight was 202,400lbs.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-22 (Blinder)", "aircraft_type": "Medium Bomber / Reconnaissance Aircraft"}, {"id": "f509e914-ef0f-4eaa-862e-cad2af56daa8", "year_model": "1961", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Beriev Be-12 \"Mail\" was a successful flying boat aircraft developed for the Soviet Navy as a replacement for its troublesome Be-10 \"Mallow\" series during the Cold War. It fulfilled the role of maritime patrol and reconnaissance and showcased a turboprop design over the former's turbojet arrangement. Like the Be-10 before it, the Be-12 went on to set several world aircraft records for an aircraft of this type. The series was available in prototype form in 1960, first unveiled to the public during 1961 and entered production soon afterwards. 143 of the type were produced in all with some still flying today (2014).\n\r\nThe Be-12 was powered by 2 x Ivchenko Progress AI-20D turboprop engines mounted high on a high-wing monoplane assembly. The wings were notably cranked upwards from the fuselage in a \"gull-wing\" type arrangement. As with other flying boat designs, the use of high-mounted wings aided in lift as well as clearing the engines from the surface of the water. To prevent tipping, pontoon floats were affixed under each wing. The Be-12 was typically crewed by four to six personnel. Beyond its water-based landing and take-off, it also held an inherent amphibious quality thanks to its wheeled undercarriage - a feature retained from the preceding Be-10 design. As such, it could function as a traditional land-based aircraft from prepared runways. Beyond that, the Be-12 accommodated a MAD (Magnetic Anomaly Detection) system in the tail, a radar housed in the nose section and a glazed observation position also in the nose.\n\r\nDimensions included a length of 98.8 feet, a wingspan of 98 feet, and a height of 26 feet. Empty weight was listed at 52,800lb with a Maximum Take-Off Weight of 79,200lb. Performance from the twin-turboprop engines included a maximum speed of 330 miles per hour, a range out to 2,100 miles and a service ceiling of 26,250 feet.\n\r\nThe Be-12 bettered the outgoing Be-10 - which it succeeded in Soviet Naval Aviation service - by improving its operational ranges. Its payload included up to 3,300lbs of externally-held stores in the form of torpedoes, depth charges, mines, or conventional drop bombs.\n\r\nThe series was exported to Egypt, Syria, and Vietnam while ex-Soviet stocks fell to the Ukrainians. Additionally, ex-Soviet Navy models were reconstituted into the reborn Russian Navy after the fall of the Soviet Empire in the early 1990s.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Beriev Be-12 Tchaika (Mail)", "aircraft_type": "Maritime Patrol / Reconnaissance Flying Boat"}, {"id": "e2199f01-c836-429a-8904-1734782f3a75", "year_model": "1960", "description": "\r\n        \tPost-World War 2 swept-wing research - coupled with advanced in turbojet technology - allowed the Soviet Union to field many capable aircraft types during the Cold War decades. One, often overlooked, multi-role performer became the Yakovlev Yak-28 which began operational service as a high-speed, medium tactical bomber. The line eventually evolved to cover a wide variety of Soviet military aviation requirements including trainer, interceptor, fast reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare Aircraft (EWA) / Electronic CounterMeasures (ECM) platforms. Due to the multiple guises presented, NATO provided three distinct codenames for each of the major variants - \"Brewer\" (A, B, and C marks for the tactical bomber forms), \"Maestro\" (for the two-seat trainer) and \"Firebar\" (interceptor form). The reconnaissance variants fell under the Brewer-D marker and EWA/ECM versions retained the original Brewer name as Brewer-E.\n\r\nThe Yakovlev concern began formal operations in 1934, just prior to World War 2, and produced several well-known military aircraft in its time including the wartime Yak-1, Yak-3, Yak-3 and Yak-9 piston-engined fighters. It also developed the Yak-38 \"Forger\" Vertical/Short Take-Off  and Landing (V/STOL) fighter for the Soviet Navy.\n\nDevelopment\n\r\nFirst flight of a Yak-28 prototype - known under the model designation of \"Yak-129\") - occurred on Match 5th, 1958 and, upon passing the requisite trials, the aircraft was adopted into the inventory of the Soviet Air Force beginning in 1960. Eventual use spanned into general Soviet air defense branches and service in the post-Cold War/post-Soviet Empire service with a new emerging Russia, independent Ukraine and independent Turkmenistan. Production yielded 1,180 examples and initial delivered examples were the tactical bomber types, though in limited numbers and lacking any radar facilities.\n\r\nAs was the case throughout the Cold War years, the Yak-28 was not known to Western observers until its public display at the 1961 Tushino Air Show. The West incorrectly identified the aircraft as a further evolution of the Yak-25 \"Flashlight\" interceptor/reconnaissance line and granted the same codename. Despite some physical similarities, the aircraft was later revealed to be an all-new design and granted the \"Brewer\" codename.\n\nYak-28 Walk-Around\n\r\nThe Yak-28's design continued the highly traditional, no-frills approach consistent with other Soviet turbojet-powered aircraft of the period. It was conventional in its layout, utilizing external engine nacelles slung under the swept-wing appendages. This assisted with general maintenance and replacement but added drag when compared to airframes who buried their powerplants within the fuselage. The wings were high-mounted monoplanes with good clearance for underwing stores across two hardpoints outboard of the engine nacelles. The fuselage was tubular in its general shape with a pointed nosecone assembly, framed canopy set ahead of midships and a swept tail unit with high-mounted horizontal planes. The planes were also swept in their appearance to promote maximum aerodynamic efficiency at the expected higher operating speeds. If there was one facet of the Yak-28 that was unconventional it was in its undercarriage which utilized a twin-wheeled nose leg and a twin-wheeled rear fuselage leg. Support for each wing during ground running was facilitated by single-wheeled stems near the wingtips. Overall, the undercarriage gave the aircraft a pronounced \"nose-up\" appearance with the fuselage sitting quit close to the ground.\n\nYak-28 Bomber Variants\n\r\nThe Yak-28 was born as a medium-class tactical bomber and initially delivered in the basic, limited production Yak-28-designated form. This was followed by the Yak-28B (\"Brewer-A\") bomber variant which added weapon-assisted radar functionality and support for Jet-Assisted Take-Off (JATO) pods, the latter for quick-reaction take-offs. Another tactical bomber form was the Yak-28L (\"Brewer-B\") which installed a ground-based targeting system, production of this model peaking at 111 examples. The Yak-28I (\"Brewer-C\") integrated an onboard ground mapping radar with targeting system for improved tactical value. Production of this mark totaled 223 units.\n\nThe Yak-28P Interceptor\n\r\nThe Yak-28P became the dedicated long-range, missile-armed interceptor which could be called upon, in relatively short order, to take on marauding Western bombers or spy planes. The type was born in 1960 and entered service as soon as 1964. These versions lacked the internal bomb bay of their tactical bomber brethren which allowed for more onboard fuel stores to be exercised. An interception radar was standard and fitted in the nose cone assembly while integrated with the aircraft's missile-only payload. Production resulted in 435 aircraft.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Yakovlev Yak-28 (Brewer / Firebar)", "aircraft_type": "Twin-Seat Multirole Aircraft"}, {"id": "3ae5857a-f6ea-4602-9c14-0793b3bfd20d", "year_model": "1959", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-12 (NATO codename of \"Cub\") was the primary medium-lift military transport of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and allies during the Cold War decades. It operated in similar form and function to the American Lockheed C-130 Hercules which proved exceedingly popular in the West. The An-12 held a direct origin to the An-8, a twin-engine, high-winged light military transport adopted by the Soviet Air Force as well as the civilian passenger airliner concern of Aeroflot. The An-10 was then born of the An-8 to become a four-engined passenger hauler with lengthened fuselage for Aeroflot and, from this, was delivered the military-minded An-12 - retaining the former's four-engine design and high-mounted wings while introducing a rear cargo access ramp akin to the preceding An-8 design.\n\r\nWith more land area to defend than any other superpower of the time, the Soviet military was faced with the daunting prospect of finding ways to mobilize and transport large amounts of men, equipment and weapons to hotspots wherever they may arise. As such, the nation went through an extended period of developing medium and heavy freighters (which continued to this day) to help fill this important logistical role.\n\r\nThe An-12 was designed by Russian Oleg Antonov whose bureau shares his name. First flight of an An-12 prototype was on December 16th, 1957 and powered through 4 x Kuznetsov NK-4 turboprop engines. This same prototype was then severely damaged on a landing approach in 1958, perhaps serving as a symbol of the aircraft's troubled existence still to be realized. Further testing finally cleared the type for military service as the An-12BP and these were outfitted with 4 x Ivchenko AI-20 series turboprop engines. Production of the type spanned from 1957 into 1973 to which 1,248 were produced under various configurations and designations.\n\r\nThe value of such platforms as the An-12 lay in their short runway capabilities and hauling qualities. This was aided, in part, by the high-mounted wings and four engine installations. The high-mounted wing allowed for strong lifting qualities while also clearing the spinning propeller blades from ground personnel moving around the outside of the aircraft. The raised tail unit also allowed unrestricted access to the cargo hold by way of a powered door and loading ramp. With the cockpit set well-forward in the design, the fuselage could largely serve to manage cargo as well as fuel stores and other mission-pertinent components. While traditionally unarmed, some Zn-12 variants featured a 2 x 23mm NR-23 cannon installation at the tail to counter perusing aircraft - a common practice seen in many large aircraft of the Cold War period. A typical crew numbered five personnel to include a pair of pilots, a flight engineer, a navigator and a radioman.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Antonov An-12 (Cub)", "aircraft_type": "Military Transport Aircraft"}, {"id": "4cc716f0-30b7-4d1f-92d7-6c0071f77e97", "year_model": "1959", "description": "\r\n        \tThe MiG-21 was undoubtedly the most successful Cold War fighter in terms of reach, operating in over 50 air forces around the globe and seeing production well past the 10,000 example mark. The aircraft was developed with lessons learned in the Korean War based on after-action reports and valuable pilot input. The end-product for the Mikoyan-Gurevich firm would be the pinnacle of MiG fighter development that began in 1938 during World War 2 and culminated in over a decade of research, testing and development to produce the exceptional MiG-21. Despite having limited range (common in many of the early thirsty jet-powered implements), the MiG-21 was none-the-less easy to operate, easy to maintain and cost-effective to the point that many-a-nation went on to field the type - some even to this day.\n\nBackground\n\r\nMikoyan-Gurevich was formed in the relatively early stages of World War 2 by the Soviet government. The firm's initial production offerings became the modestly-successful MiG-1 and MiG-3 piston-engined fighters that helped to stave off the German advance into Russia. While not an overly spectacular aircraft - utilizing a basic conventional light airframe with a very powerful engine - it gave Mikoyan-Gurevich some level of successful to build a foundation on for developments to come. By the end of World War 2, the firm had produced their first production jet-powered aircraft in the MiG-9 \"Fargo\". While unspectacular in itself and very prone to accident, the Fargo was still produced in nearly 600 examples and set the stage for the firm's next success  in the smallish MiG-15 \"Fagot\".\n\r\nThe jet-powered, swept-wing MiG-15 appeared as something of a surprise to UN pilots in their straight-wing Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars and Republic F-84 Thunderjets. It was not uncommon for UN piston-powered aircraft to square off against these silver-colored nimble machines as well. The MiG-15 proved more than a handful to her adversaries - especially when in control by Soviet airmen - to the point that a counteragent - the North American F-86 Sabre - was brought in to force a political and military \"tie\" to the conflict, an \"uneasy peace\" more or less. Over 12,000 MiG-15's were ultimately produced with a further few thousand more coming under license outside of the Soviet Union.\n\r\nThe MiG-15 was bettered in the development MiG-17 which was already in the works during the Korean War and made operational in the Soviet inventory in 1952. Though not utilized in the Korean conflict, it went on to see notable action in the Vietnam War and elsewhere. While an improvement over the MiG-15 in most regards, the MiG-17 was still a subsonic performer - that is, operating under the mach 1 speed ceiling. Production still topped over 10,000 examples.\n\r\nEverything changed with the arrival of the much-improved MiG-19 \"Famer\" appearing in 1955. The aircraft was a second-generation, twin-engined jet fighter with similar wing sweep and gave Soviet airmen their first taste of sustained Mach 1 flight. Over 2,000 of the type were manufactured with license production occurring in China. Like the MiG-17 before it, the MiG-19 also later fought in the skies over Vietnam.\n\nThe Call Comes In\n\r\nIn the fall of 1953, the Soviet government issued a requirement for a lightweight Mach 2-capable interceptor fighter for its Frontal Aviation branch of the Soviet Air Force. The interceptor would have to make use of a radar-ranging sight for gun accuracy and have the capability to retrofit missile armament once the technology was made available while sustain an impressive rate-of-climb (this was to be an interceptor after all). Mikoyan-Gurevich jumped at the challenge and held something of an advantage in that the firm had already been experimenting with varied wing forms, airframes and available engines by this time.\n\nThe Prototypes\n\r\nA complex system such as the MiG-21 was born from a variety of prototypes and developmental flight models. This began with the Ye-1, a design study fitting the Mikulin (Tumansky) AM-11 turbojet engine. This spawned another \"one-off\" model in the Ye-50, essentially a Ye-1 mounting the AM-9Ye turbojet engine with a liquid-propellant rocket booster for added thrust. The Ye-2 became another design left waiting for an AM-11 engine to become available and was therefore fitted with the AM-9B as found on the MiG-19 \"Farmer\" instead. The Ye-2 also introduced large ventral strakes towards the rear of the fuselage. Another Ye-2 design was given the now-available AM-11 turbojet and became the Ye-2A. Two delta-winged designs became the Ye-4 (fitting the AM-9B turbojet) and the Ye-5 (fitting the AM-11 turbojet). All five of these prototypes were ordered built (Ye-1, Ye-50, Ye-2a, Ye-4 and Ye-5) and would feature the identifiable conical assembly in its nose intake, a single vertical tail fin, integrated ejection seat system, tricycle undercarriage and similar internal components.\n\r\nThe Ye-2 was ahead of the group in terms of development and went airborne on February 14th, 1955 with good results, albeit a little slow than expected. The similar Ye-4 followed suit on June 16th, 1955, though this prototype fitted a near-triangular, small-area pointed pair of delta wings along with conventional tailplanes along the empennage sides. These thin wings forced the design to take on \"blisters\" above and below the wing roots to fit the upright main landing gear wheels. Performance of the Ye-4 was only marginally improved over that of the preceding Ye-2. The Ye-5 and Ye-50-1 both went airborne on January 9th, 1956. Confident that production would soon follow on either design, Mikoyan-Gurevich had two company designations reserved for the two models - \"MiG-21\" went to the tailed-delta wing version while \"MiG-23\" was reserved for the swept-wing version (this MIG-23 not to be confused with the later development of the MiG-23 \"Flogger\").\n\r\nIt should be noted here that true delta-wing forms generally did not make use of tailplanes as their main wing systems of large surface area replaced the need for such. Delta wings offered excellent lift but poor maneuverability. Additional inherent benefits could include in-wing fuel storage and multiple underwing hardpoints when compared to a conventional swept-wing aircraft. Of particular note here is that MiG had little to no experience in dealing with delta-winged products to this point - hence the interesting approach in their design of the Ye-4 prototype. While the Ye-4 did use a delta-wing approach, these implements were smaller-area assemblies and the design still made use of tailplanes - these all-moving surfaces by the way.\n\r\nVersions of each aircraft (the swept- and delta-wing prototypes) later appeared over the Moscow Tushino airfield during the annual Aviation Day celebration on June 24th, 1956. Western observers were quick to note the types and NATO immediately assigned the swept-wing version the codename of \"Faceplate\" while the tailed-delta design received the  codename of \"Fishbed\".\n\r\nDevelopment continued at Mikoyan-Gurevich. Several more prototypes were produced with redesigned portions as dictated by testing. In 1957, three Ye-6 prototype appeared sporting the tailed-delta wing of the Ye-5 but with clipped wingtips and a redesigned nose cone (this among other changes throughout). Flight testing began on May 20th, 1958 of the Ye-6. the program hit a delay when prototype Ye-6/1 was lost to engine failure, resulting in the death of the test pilot from injuries received in the crash. The pilot valiantly tried to restart the engine to no avail.\n\r\nYe-6/2 did away with wing boundary layer fences in early prototypes (and these as found on the MiG-15, -17 and -19 before it). Instead, smaller wing fences were installed in their place to help with stability. Additionally, cannon armament was now officially installed in the Ye-6/2. The Ye-6/3 was the first prototype to feature a centerline fuel tank to help increase the design's endurance - a product limitation. The prototypes officially bested the required maximum speed goal of Mach 2 by hitting Mach 2.05. Production forms soon followed and a public appearance of the finished aircraft occurred in 1961, greeting many in the West who were convinced all along that the swept-wing MiG-23 \"Faceplate\" would become the Soviet Union's next frontline fighter.\n\r\nThe MiG-21 began deliveries to the Soviet Air Force in late 1957 and continued into 1958. The type was officially introduced as the MiG-21F in 1959. In the Soviet/Russian inventories alone, the aircraft served for decades until a viable air superiority replacement was finally found in the MiG-29 Fulcrum, to which led to the gradual retirement of the MiG-21 throughout the 1990s. \n\r\nProduction of trainers and fighters ran from 1959 through 1985 and was split between three major plants in Gorkiy, Moscow and Tbilisi. Gorkiy produced no less than 5,278 systems while Moscow accounted for 3,203. Tbilisi delivered some 1,660 aircraft. The official total topped 10,158 aircraft while overall totals ranged up to 11,496.\n\nThe Missile Solution\n\r\nThe missile solution for the MiG-21 was solved when an American AIM-9 Sidewinder was passed to the Soviet Union by way of China in their fight with Taiwan. The missile was dissected (reverse engineered) and eventually became a Soviet \"rip-off\" in the K-13 (NATO codename of AA-2 \"Atoll\"), an infrared homing short-range air-to-air missile. The missile promptly entered service with Soviet forces in 1960 and became standard use on the MiG-21 and the later swing-wing MiG-23 \"Flogger\" as well as the Sukhoi Su-17, -20 and -22 fighters.\n\nWalk-Around\n\r\nThe MiG-21 production Fishbeds were little different that the preceding prototype designs. Wings were of the tailed-delta configuration with both pairs swept and mid-mounted to the fuselage. The main wings were thin and near-triangular shapes with clipped wingtips. It was expected that later forms of the aircraft should be able to accept missiles as the technology became more entrenched and this was eventually made possible with the arrival of the AA-2 \"Atoll\". As such, the Fishbed had a set of pylons added to her wings and provision was eventually made for the aircraft to field up to four such missiles. While all other early MiG fighters (the MiG-15, -17, and -19) all made use of heavy boundary layer fencing along the dorsal side of the wings, the MiG-21 did away with these large implements and instead settled on two smaller fences placed just ahead of the ailerons - one to each wing. The fuselage was a near-circle form, capped at the front with a nose-mounted cone placed within the nose intake. Ductwork ran along the sides of the cockpit to feed the single engine. Like other MiG fighters before it, the fuselage was also designed to be detached at the base of the empennage for ease of maintenance and repair.\n\r\nThe cockpit in earlier Fishbeds offered up relatively good visibility thanks to its lower spine. Later models incorporating a raised spine from the rear of the canopy to the base of the vertical fin obscured the rear view but increased endurance. Also in original Fishbeds, the single-piece canopy was hinged to open forward while later models were issued a new two-piece system hinged to the right. The canopy was designed to eject with the ejection seat and pilot, affording the pilot a set time of protection while in the air (the canopy was directly connected to the top of the seat) and ultimately detaching itself from the pilot and seat altogether. Framing was apparent in the front windscreen and reminiscent of earlier MiG fighter designs.\n\r\nThe undercarriage was of a tricycle arrangement and featured a conventional layout of two main landing gears and a nose wheel system. All systems were single-wheeled with the nose wheel noticeably smaller than the main wheels. While the nose landing gear recessed forwards and up into the fuselage, the main landing gears operated in a distinct way. The struts folded forward and angled while the wheels remained upright during the entire process. Due to her thin wings, the main gears had to retract into the underfuselage sides. As such, slightly noticeable blisters above and below the wing roots became a standard design feature in the Fishbed.\n\r\nStandard armament most always comprised of cannons mounted in an underfuselage pod rear of the forward fuselage but ahead of amidships. While early Fishbeds were fielded as such, others either deleted one of the cannons or deleted the entire armament station altogether. The addition of wing pylons in later production models expanded the Fishbeds role into both air superiority and ground strike making for one true multi-role performer.\n\r\nThe empennage was dominated by the large vertical tail fin, integrated at the base by the pipe fairing (or the raised spine in later models) running from the rear of the cockpit to the start of the swept-back fin surface. The vertical wing was of relatively large surface area and held the rudder. The horizontal tailplanes were all-moving and situated slightly above and behind the main wings and highly swept with slight anhedral (some models sporting anti-flutter devices at the tips). The large ventral strakes were clearly visible in all later development Fishbeds and ultimate production systems. The large single engine exhaust port completed the rear fuselage details.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (Fishbed)", "aircraft_type": "Single-Seat Supersonic Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "9ea643e4-4d4f-410e-b062-4db4fcf2dd5f", "year_model": "1957", "description": "\r\n        \tThe 1950 and 1960s were a tremendous period of growth and advancement for commercial / passenger flight. The end of World War 2 in 1945 allowed all-new technologies to be employed in non-military circles and this included turbojet and turboprop engines. Ilyushin, the storied big-plane manufacturer of the Soviet Union, delivered one of its best-known products in this window - the Ilyushin Il-18.\n\r\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet passenger carrier Aeroflot, founded in 1923, released a new requirement calling for a budget-friendly 75- to 100-seat airliner for its various routes. This work begat the Ilyushin Il-18 which earned itself the NATO codename of \"Coot\". The aircraft went on to see a considerable service career in both civilian and military industries and did much to further Soviet air travel during the 1960s and 1970s. The airframe also served well beyond its given passenger-hauling role, adopted for maritime patrol, airborne command post and ELINT (ELectronic INTelligence) activities. Production of the ultimately 678 total aircraft spanned from 1957 to 1985 from Moscow Machinery Plant No. 30.\n\r\nTo go along with the new aircraft directive was also development of all-new turboprop engines. This fell to Kuznetsov and Ivchenko while Ilyushin and Antonov would each focus on the airframe. The Ilyushin submission became the four-engined \"Il-18\"and Antonov pushed its four-engined \"An-10\". The engine of choice was to eventually become the Kuznetsov NK-4 series.\n\r\nA prototype of the Ilyushin design was revealed in June of 1957 and testing ensued throughout thate summer with a first-flight recorded on July 4th, 1957. The Il-18 was selected to succeed the aging line of Il-14 aircraft on the Ilyushin production lines and the initial market form became known as the \"Il-18A\", this offering seating 89. The engines, the NK-4 series, proved so unreliable that a move was made to the competing Ivchenko AI-20 after only twenty aircraft were completed with the original engine fit. The shift in powerplant then produced the \"Il-18B\" designation and a prototype of this form first flew on September 30th, 1958 and became the first major mark of the series. Then followed the Il-18 \"Combi\" which combined passenger and cargo functionality into one suitable airframe.\n\r\nThe Il-18D carried more powerful AI-20M engines (4,250 horsepower) and increased seating for up to 122 as well as an extra internal fuel tank for increased ranges. A communications model was born from this mark as well and three were produced to the standard for the Russian government. The Il-18D \"Pomor\" was a one-off Il-18D model for use in the fisheries industry. The Il-18D \"Salon\" was the VIP transport version of the Il-18D line.\n\r\nThe Il-18D featured a crew of nine with up to 120 passengers. It sported a length of 35.9 meters with a wingspan of 37.4 meters and height of 10 meters. Empty weight was listed at 35,000 kilograms with a MTOW of 64,000 kg. Maximum speed was 675 kmh and cruising was int eh 625 kmh range. Operational range was 6,500 kilometers and the service ceiling became 11,800 meters.\n\r\nA pair of Il-18D aircraft served as the basis for the Il-18DORR fisheries industry model. The Il-18E was based on the Il-18I but lacked the increased fuel capacity and, therefore, decreased its operational range. The Il-18E \"Salon\" was its VIP model. The Il-18Gr was completed as a converted cargo form.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Ilyushin IL-18 (Coot)", "aircraft_type": "Turboprop-Powered Passenger Airliner / Maritime Reconnaissance Platform"}, {"id": "eb79d3df-0638-496e-bd80-3d154bbfa5ce", "year_model": "1956", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Cessna Model 172 is the most successful light aircraft in history with 44,000 production units made since series introduction occurred in 1956 (and production continuing today - 2018). The Model 172 was developed from the earlier Model 170 which appeared in 1948 as a single-engine, shoulder-winged general aviation aircraft with fixed, \"tail-dragging\" undercarriage through 5,174 examples. The follow-on Model 172 found huge success in the general aviation market as well as the military sphere and, despite its Cold War-era introduction, continues to \"fly high\" even today (2018).\n\r\nThe Cessna 172 was drawn up as an improved version of the original Model 170. The series was first-flown in January of 1955 as the \"Model 170C\" and carried a Continental O-300-A engine driving a two-bladed propeller unit at the nose. The tailfin and elevators were both redesigned from the original and were given an increase to surface area for added stability and control. Further changes (following certification) of the C-model ultimately introduced the iconic fixed, wheeled tricycle undercarriage common to Model 172 aircraft today. Cabin seating allowed for four-to-five persons to be carried including the pilot. Forward positions numbered two (side-by-side) with the remaining three in the back (side-by-side-by-side). In this revised form, the aircraft was first-flown on June 12th, 1955 and was introduced for service as the \"Model 172\". The type proved immediately popular with thousands being manufactured in the first few years of availability alone.\n\r\nThroughout the course of its operational service life, the Cessna 172 underwent an evolution that saw both minor and major revisions to the line - increasing gross weights, aerodynamic efficiency, performance, ergonomics and the like. Modifications allowed for floatplane /amphibious models to emerge and the type was also taken into military service by the USAF as a flight trainer through the T-41 \"Mescalero\" variant (detailed elsewhere on this site). The Model 172A of 1960 introduced the modern swept-back tail fin while the \"Skyhawk\" deluxe package was introduced in the Model 172B of late-1960. The Model 172I of 1968 was the first to switch over to the Lycoming O-320-E2D engine of 150 horsepower (thereby increasing some performance figures).\n\r\nVarious other military powers soon adopted the type in useful numbers for both land- and sea-based service to undertake a plethora of roles. The Model 172 has since evolved to much more modern forms today (2018) all the while retaining its versatility, reliability, and popularity - making it a sound choice for first-time student flyers and veteran general aviation buffs alike.\n\nThe Cessna 172 as a Record-Setter\r\nIn 1958, the Cessna 172 was used to set an endurance record in which the aircraft covered 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in a flight originating from, and ending at, McCarran Airfield in Las Vegas, Nevada. With some modifications in place as well as a very detailed flight plan, the aircraft with its crew of two were able to make the round-the-world journey in the light airplane. The flight went down in the history books and the record stands to this day.\n\nPerformance\n\r\nThe base Model 172R form offers a cruising speed of 140 miles per hour with a range of 800 miles. Its service ceiling is 13,500 feet and rate-of-climb reaches 720 feet-per-minute. Empty weight is 1,700lb against an MTOW of 2,450lb.

The aircraft owed much to the two preceding developmental designs, both of which were cancelled after just prototypes were completed and evaluated though all could trace their lineage back to the Tupolev Tu-4 \"Bull\". While the Tu-4 was produced under the Soviet Tupolev brand label, it was nothing more than an unlicensed copy of the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress of which three was force-landed on Soviet soil and confiscated during World War 2 (1939-1945) following raids on Japan. The B-29 offered Soviet engineers the necessary data on producing long-range heavy bomber types which were then lacking in the Soviet air arm amidst growing concern over the American reach and its nuclear program. The Tu-80 utilized conventional propeller-driven power which ultimately lacked the qualities desired when compared to the promising Tu-85 and its reciprocating engines. However, both eventually lost out to the turboprop-powered \"Tu-95\" development which went on to have a very healthy service life that continues even today (December 2013).\n\r\nThe decision to move towards the turboprop form over a turbojet configuration promised better endurance as jets still proved fuel-hungry propulsion systems. The offer for a new, swept-wing ,jet-powered strategic bomber initially fell to the competing concern of Myasishchev who sold the Soviet military on the idea of a 590 mile per hour bomber with 8,070 mile range. No to be outdone, engineers at Tupolev went hard at work on a competing type and this was initially based on captured war-time plans from Germany for a swept-wing , jet-powered bomber. The Myasishchev design was eventually adopted as the jet-powered, swept-wing M-4 \"Bison\" but Tupolev persisted in its own design goal nonetheless, and influenced, in part, by its existing large-body aircraft programs in the Tu-4 and Tu-85. Swept-wing design experience would be forged through the existing Tu-16 \"Badger\" and Tu-88 products.\n\r\nTwo Tupolev design forms then became apparent: one was a four-engined jet development competing against a four-engined turboprop variant. While logic of the time favored the jet, Tupolev was sold on the range of the turboprop approach with its propeller-driven configuration. The technology for this was formed through the captured German Junkers Jumo 022 system. By this time, the Tupolev product was granted the working designation of \"Aircraft 95\" - better known as the \"Tu-95\" - and offered official support from the government though, on several occasions, Tupolev owner A.N. Tupolev himself had to fight governmental hierarchy to keep his Tu-95 project alive - authorities still favoring a jet-powered design form.\n\r\nFirst flight of a Tu-95 prototype was finally recorded on November 12th, 1952. The design exhibited a lengthy, tubular-yet-squat fuselage with wide-spanning, high-mounted, swept-back wings. Each wing managed a pair of turboprops in long nacelles found at the leading edges. These turboprops drove two four-bladed propellers in a contra-rotating fashion. The cockpit was stepped and sported heavy framing though all four engines could be clearly seen from the seat positions. The nose was glazed for the bomber crew. The fuselage tapered slight to form the empennage to which a single, high-reaching vertical tail fin was mounted along with low-set, swept-back horizontal tail planes. The undercarriage was fully-retractable and of the tricycle configurations - this traced back to the original Boeing B-29 approach. The prototype was recognized internally at Tupolev as the \"Tu-95-1\" and power was served through 4 x Kuznetsov 2TV-2F coupled turboprops. Standard armament included 1 or 2 x 23mm AM-23 radar-controlled cannons in the tail - a common fixture of large Soviet bombers of the period. The bomb-carrying capacity reached nearly 20,000lbs and eventually would include support for missiles.\n\r\nWith the program proceeding, the gearbox ultimately delivered trouble during testing and this led to the loss of prototype 95-1 when engine No. 3 caught fire in flight. It eventually broke free of its mounting and caused the aircraft to crash, amazingly killing only four of its eleven crew on May 17th, 1953. This particular event steered the design team away from the original Kuznetsov engines and towards the Kuznetsov NK-12 series instead. This move begat the \"Tu-95-2\" prototype.\n\r\nAfter passing all of the requisite testing and evaluations, the Tu-95 was officially adopted for service in the Soviet military with production spanning from 1952 to 1994. Some 500 units would be built in all with formal introduction of the aircraft occurring in 1956. The aircraft carried the NATO codename of \"Bear\" once properly identified.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-95 (Bear)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Reconnaissance / Heavy Bomber Aircraft"}, {"id": "2fae6b20-b4a3-451c-9edc-1f11ecf94978", "year_model": "1955", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Myasishchev M-4 (NATO codename of \"Bison\") was developed to a Soviet Navy requirement for a jet-powered, long-range maritime reconnaissance platform with a secondary strategic bombing role -capable of reaching targets within North American territories. By the end of its service life, the metal-skinned aircraft would see extended service as a dedicated inflight refueler and missile carrier platform. Two prototypes were eventually realized before some 91 production aircraft followed. Since retired by the mid-1990s, the M-4 certainly gave Western observers great pause during the tumultuous years of the Cold War with overstated capabilities being reported as in so many other secretive Soviet-originated systems. However, unlike other Soviet products of the period, the M-4 series was never exported beyond its home borders to allies or satellite states and none were ever utilized in combat actions.\n\r\nThe short-lived Myasishchev concern was established in 1951 by Vladimir Myasishchev for the purposed of the M-4 strategic bomber program. The firm went on to add several other designs and concepts throughout its active years, most notably producing the supersonic, four-engined M-50 \"Bounder\" series of 1959 of which only two ever existed. The M-55 high-altitude reconnaissance and research aircraft was another interesting addition that mimicked the scope of the American U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance platform, essentially becoming the definitive Myasishchev product and legacy. The concern operated only until 1960 before it was formally dissolved.\n\r\nThe M-4 was crewed by eight personnel made up of pilots, mission specialists and gunners. Dimensionally, it sported a running length of nearly 155 feet with a wingspan of 165 feet, 7 inches. When at rest, the M-4 stood at 46 feet, 3 inches atop its centerline retractable undercarriage, the drooping wingtip supported by smaller wheeled legs. The design encompassed a sharply-pointed nosecone assembly to which the flight deck was fitted just ahead of the shoulder-mounted wings. The wingroots contained the 4 x Mikulin AM-3A turbojet engines, aspirated along the wing leading edge and exhausting through the trailing edge. The wings themselves were well-swept in accordance to the growing aerodynamic direction encountered throughout the 1950s. The fuselage then trailed into a tapered, raised empennage to which a single, high-reaching vertical tail fin was affixed. This mounted a pair of horizontal tail planes designed to clear the exhaust of the four-engine wing setup. The four-engined configuration allowed for a top speed of 588 miles per hour to be reached. Range was 5,000 miles with a near 3,500 combat radius. The M-4 exhibited a service ceiling of 36,000 feet.\n\r\nWhile a bomber by trade, the M-4 was defensed through a network of 9 x 23mm NR-23 cannons (this arrangement could be replaced by 6 x 23mm AM-23 cannons). The cannons were dispersed through dorsal, ventral and tail fuselage barbettes for optimal reaches about the aircraft. The cannon armament was standard and intended solely for defense of the crew and airframe. However, as a strategic bombing platform, the M-4 could field up to 53,000lbs of internal stores - both conventional and nuclear in nature though a typical load of 19,800 was generally utilized. Later M-4 models could make use of Soviet-designed cruise missiles along externally-mounted, underwing hardpoints to broaden the tactical reach of the bomber, particularly in the armed patrol role.\n\r\nThe M-4 was originally born as the Izdeliye (\"Product M\") /  SDB (\"Strategicheskiy Dahl'niy Bombardirovschik\") program designation. Initial production aircraft were designated simply as \"M-4\" and included two prototypes followed by 35 production-quality airframes. These received the NATO reporting designation of \"Bison-A\". M-4 aircraft were then modified for the air refueling role as the M-4-2 (retaining their NATO designation of Bison-A). The 3M designation was reserved for \"improved\" M4 models fitted with uprated Dobrynin VD-7 powerplants (becoming the NATO \"Bison-B\"). The 3M-5 were similarly improved through new Dobrynin VD-7 engines and support for KSR-5 air-to-surface missiles (also Bison-B). The 3MD was a refined cruise missile carrier of 1960 with new search radar functionality and received the NATO reporting name of \"Bison-C\". The 3ME was a one-off 3M production model with updated avionics and radar (Bison-B). The 3MS-1 was a new generation Bison with a specified bomber role and Mikulin RD-3M or AM-3A series engines (NATO Bison-B). The 3MS-2 was an in-flight refueler platform with Mikulin engines. New engines greeted the 3MN-1 long-range bomber designation as did the 3MN-2. The 3MSR-1 featured base engines with upgraded avionics. Cargo variants were recognized as the VM-T - primarily used to shuttle the Buran space module. The M-6 designation recognized re-engined 3M aircraft (also NATO Bison-A).\n\r\nM-4 airframes were eventually given up through the various arms limitation treaties emerging throughout the 1980s and advancing missile technologies, leaving very few as existing museum pieces. Both the Soviet Navy and Air Force became operators of the type throughout its service life.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Myasishchev M-4 / 3M (Bison)", "aircraft_type": "Strategic Heavy Bomber"}, {"id": "265f7843-a9c9-4e26-8f41-06955ae5f188", "year_model": "1954", "description": "\r\n        \tFrom the 1960s to the early 1990s, the Soviet Air Force and Navy - as well as several other global military services - operate the technological success that was the Tupolev Tu-16 strategic bomber  (codenamed \"Badger\" by NATO). The type was developed to a specific Soviet defense requirement calling for a fast, high-altitude, medium-class, nuclear-capable bomber to penetrate enemy airspace and unleash a lethal war load at range. As such, the design was outfitted with the most powerful turbojet engines available to Soviet engineers at the time and featured swept-back wings for high-speed flight - the first Soviet-originated bomber to feature this quality. Before the end, just over 1,500 examples were completed and these went on to serve with Soviet-aligned nations such including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Egypt, Georgia, Indonesia, Iraq, and Ukraine. The reborn Russian Air Force (as well as other global players) simply absorbed the existing fleet of Tu-16s with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1991. Amazingly, these final forms were not retired until 1993 - not bad for an aircraft born in the 1950s!\n\nDevelopment\n\r\nFollowing World War 2 (1939-1945), the East and West were divided in what became known as the \"Cold War\" (1947-1991) pitting the Soviet Union and its allies against the United States and its allies. As such, the militaries of these two powerful global players were often in a tit-for-tat affair with one another in which technology gains were the deciding factor. In time, nuclear weaponry became the ultimate deterrence and both sides strove to develop ever-more potent weapons-delivery platforms to outdo the other side.\n\r\nWith the widespread adoption of turbojet technology in military aircraft following the close of World War 2, bomber platforms simply became faster and higher-flying than ever before. This led the Soviet Union to invest heavily in development of various bomber designs, particularly those able to carry and deliver nuclear-minded payloads over range and at altitude. At this time, the Soviet Air Force could only deploy its limited fleet of Tupolev Tu-4 \"Bull\" heavy bombers but these were four-engined, prop-driven aircraft simply illegal, reverse-engineered from captured American Boeing B-29 Superfortress with technology rooted in the fighting of World War 2. As such, more was expected from the Soviet bomber fleet leading to the rise of a new generation of aircraft still to come.\n\r\nAround this time, Soviet engineers were also making great strides in the field of aerospace aided largely by access to the British Rolls-Royce \"Nene\" turbojet engine as well as captured wartime German data and technology. The Mikulin AM-3 turbojet series was a development of the period that would prove instrumental to providing Soviet engineers with a capable powerplant to drive medium-to-heavy-class platforms. Its development began in 1948 and ultimately encompassed the original Am-3 offering as well as the later AM-3A, AM-3D, and AM-3M-200 model engines (this series was also copied by the Chinese as the \"WP-8\"). The engine would eventually go on to power the Tu-16 and Myasishhev M-4 products (the latter detailed elsewhere on this site).\n\r\nTupolev was in competition with Ilyushin for the lead in the new Soviet medium jet-powered bomber project. Tupolev went on to develop their \"Aircraft 88\" (or \"Tu-88\" or \"Aircraft N\") while Ilyushin laid down the framework for what was their \"Il-46\" twin-engine jet bomber. Both companies supplied prototypes for state acceptance trials to which Tupolev won out on the grounds of better performance from their Tu-88 offering. The Tupolev prototype recorded its first-flight on April 27th, 1952.\n\r\nThe Tu-88 was followed by \"Aircraft 97\" which led to the \"Aircraft 103\" model form. Serial production (to come out of Kazan) was then ordered in December of 1952 which led to series introduction  occurring in 1954 under the formal designation of \"Tu-16\". Once recognized by NATO observers, the series was given the codename of \"Badger\" so early-form Tu-16s were appropriately codenamed \"Badger-A\". The Tu-16 directly succeeded the line of Tu-4 bombers in same role with the Soviet Air Force.\n\r\nIn May of 1954, no fewer than nine new Tu-16 bombers were featured in a Moscow flyover in Red Square festivities - officially marking the unveiling of the advanced bomber.\n\nVariants\n\r\nThe Badger-A codename covered several Tu-16 operational marks: Tu-16A, Tu-16Z, Tu-16G, Tu-16N, Tu-16T, Tu-16S, and Tu-16Ye.\n\r\nThe Tu-16A was modified to carry nuclear war loads and production reached 453 units before the end. The Tu-16Z was modified to serve as an aerial tanker but retained their combat profiles. The Tu-16G was a specially-developed mailplane and crew trainer while the Tu-16N of 1963 was another tanker form and carried a \"probe-and-drogue\" fuel delivery system. The Tu-16T was utilized in the torpedo bomber role with the Soviet Navy and could carry an armament load out consisting of aerial torpedoes, depth charges, and naval mines as needed - some 26 were built to the standard. The Tu-16S was used in the Search-and-Rescue (SAR) role and the Tu-16Ye in the Electronic Warfare (EW) / ELectronic INTelligence (ELINT) roles.\n\r\nNext came the Tu-16KS in late 1954 to form the \"Badger-B\" variant. These were equipped to carry air-to-surface missiles primarily for the anti-ship role. One hundred seven examples were built from 1954 until 1958 and these were operated under the banner of the Soviet Navy for their time in the air. Additionally, both Egypt and Indonesia purchased the type.\n\r\nThe Tu-16K-10, or \"Badger-C\", also served the Soviet Navy and was, again, outfitted with anti-ship missile armament but now a radar system was installed in the nose section - considerably expanding the lethality of the bomber. Some 216 were produced from 1958 until 1963.\n\r\nThe Tu-16RM-1 (the \"Badger-D\") was built in 23 examples and used in the ELINT maritime patrol role. It was armed through missiles and also carried radar in its nose section. The Tu-6R (the \"Badger-E\") was a dedicated maritime reconnaissance platform complete with ELINT equipment and support for missiles. Sub-variants of the R-model were the KSR-2 missile-armed Tu-16RM-2 and Tu-16KRM target drone carrier.\n\r\nThe Tu-16K and Tu-16K SR fell under the NATO codename of \"Badger-G\" and operated as maritime reconnaissance bombers and missile carriers. Sub-variants were the Tu-16K SR-2, Tu-16K-11-16, Tu-16K-26, and Tu-16K-26P. All appeared during the 1960s and the G-models were regarded as the \"definitive\" Badgers.\n\r\nThe Tu-16 \"Elka\" (\"Badger-H\") and used in the dedicated EW / ECM roles. The Tu-16P \"Buket\" followed in a similar role and was known to NATO as \"Badger-J\". Another ELINT model became the Tu-16Ye \"Badger-K\" form. The Tu-16P was a modernized ELINT model and recognized as \"Badger-L\".\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Tupolev Tu-16 (Badger)", "aircraft_type": "Multirole Twin-Engined, Jet-Powered Fast Bomber"}, {"id": "36533b82-d249-4f74-af2f-46b16b1feab4", "year_model": "1947", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Antonov An-2 is a multi-role light utility biplane initially produced under the Soviet flag.

The An-2 goes under the NATO codename of \"Colt\" and is designated in US DoD nomenclature as the \"Type 22\". The Soviet Union/Russia, Poland and China have all lent a hand in production of local base and specialized variants. Operators are numerous and range from those with military service to those with civilian-minded needs.\n\nAntonov An-2 Walk-Around\n\r\nExternally, the An-2 shares many similarities with other light aircraft of this class. The engine - powering a four-bladed propeller - is held in the extreme forward of the fuselage to which the cockpit is situated directly aft. The cockpit is heavily glazed and observation port windows can be seen along the fuselage sides. The wing arrangement on this aircraft is of a sesquiplane (uneven span) biplane assembly with the top wing noticeably wider than the lower element. Each wing is connected via a single large vertical strut making up a single wing bay and each wing system showcases dihedral (upward angle). The fuselage tapers slightly into the empennage to which is affixed a single large, smooth-edge vertical tail fin and its applicable stabilizers mounted to either tail fin side. Like other aircraft of this classification, the An-2 sports a pair of fixed landing gear legs complimented by a smaller tail wheel.  The main landing gear legs feature wheel bogies decidedly angled inwards with each leg braced at two points along the underside of the fuselage. Power is supplied from a single Shvetsov ASh-62IR 9-cylinder, supercharged radial piston engine of 1,000 horsepower. Maximum speed is a reported 160 miles per hour with a listed range of 525 miles and a service ceiling equal to 14,750 feet.\n\r\nAccommodations are generally made for a crew of one pilot but an observer/co-pilot is preferred.

The CL.II was found to be a perfect platform when used in the close-support role and, as such, the CL.IV was designed as its replacement with that specific role in mind. Fielded in 1918, the type served in the final major campaigns of the First World War, taking on sorties that ran the gamut of light bombing, ground strafing, nightbombing and interception while still being capable of dogfighting.\n\r\nThe CL.IV was of an orthodox design with a crew of two. The pilot occupied the forward cockpit area just behind the trailing edge of the upper wing. Visibility was somewhat obscured due to the wing placement but views above, left and right were generally good. The pilot had access to a synchronized 7.92mm Spandau LMG 08/15 machine gun. The engine was mounted to the extreme forward of the fuselage just in front of the pilot and was of a 160 horsepower Mercedes D.III 6-cylinder, in-line, water-cooled engine type operating a two-blade propeller. The observer/gunner sat to the pilot's rear (directly behind actually, separated only by a wood panel) and operated a ring-mounted 7.92mm Parabellum LMG 14 machine gun. Externally, the CL.IV was designed to carry up to five 10 kilogram bombs. Wings were of equal span with single bays supported by parallel struts. The undercarriage was traditional, with two main wheels and a tail skid.\n\r\nThe new design proved a great deal better than her forerunner. The CL.IV was a stronger aircraft with good maneuverability. Though an exceptional aircraft when taking on ground targets, protection afforded to the crew was less than stellar, forcing the pilot to utilize the maneuverability of the CL.IV to avoid ground fire. With this in mind, the CL.IV was fielded in handfuls for collectively devastating attacks on ground forces through use of machine guns or bombs. Despite their effectiveness in this role, victory was falling ever farther from Germany's reach until the country officially capitulated.\n\r\nThe CL.IV was designed by Halberstadt chief designer Karl Thies.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Halberstadt CL.IV", "aircraft_type": "Ground Attack / Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "9fd15c7f-c2cb-45e2-9d47-5e147b6c994a", "year_model": "1918", "description": "\r\n        \tThe French Salmson concern was founded in 1890 by Emile Salmson and produced a variety of automobiles prior to World War 1. Just prior to the war, Salmson turned to manufacture of aero engines and this continued throughout the conflict, well into the 1940s. Before the company went defunct in 1946, Salmson undertook various design and production initiatives regarding military-grade aircraft - among these being the \"Salmson 2\" biplane series of World War 1 fame.\n\r\nThe Salmson 2 was developed to a French Air Force requirement for a reconnaissance-minded platform intended to supplant the outgoing Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutter and Dorand A.R. series in the same role. To this, Salmson developed a highly conventional biplane arrangement with a roughly streamlined fuselage mounting the engine at the front and a crew of two seated inline in separated, open-air cockpits. The wings sported equal span assemblies with parallel support struts and applicable cabling throughout. The empennage was traditional with a single vertical tail fin and associated horizontal tailplanes. The undercarriage was a fixed assembly of struts tied to the underside of the fuselage and lower wing assembly, sporting a pair of landing wheels. A simple tail skid assisted the rear of the aircraft when at rest.\n\r\nAs Salmson already held an established history of aero engine production, the Salmson 2 design made proper use of the in-house Salmson 9Za series radial piston engine outputting 230 horsepower and powering a wooden two-bladed propeller assembly. This supplied the completed airframe with a maximum speed of 116 miles per hour with a range out to 300 miles. The aircraft's service ceiling was listed at a useful 20,500 feet.\n\r\nConsistent with other evolved designs of the war, the Salmson 2 showcased several machine guns for which to take to the offensive or defensive as the situation in the air permitted. The pilot managed a single 0.303 caliber Vickers machine gun mated to an interrupter gear controlling the propeller. This arrangement allowed for the firing of the machine gun through the spinning propeller blades without harm to the aircraft - a technology first perfected by the Germans in the war. The rear crewman - considered an observer in the reconnaissance role and gunner in the defensive role - managed a pair of 0.303 caliber Lewis machine guns on a trainable mount. His primary role was in defense of the critical rear quadrants of the aircraft as this was where pursuing intercepting enemy aircraft would most likely originate from.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Salmson 2", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance Biplane Aircraft"}, {"id": "903a861a-834c-4c6b-ab6f-d9631ba8a857", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThe LVG C.V was a general-purpose, two-seat reconnaissance aircraft utilized by the German air service in World War 1. Despite her reconnaissance classification, the C.V proved a heady fighter in her own right, going on to become one of the best German fighter aircraft of the war. Her combination of two crew, offensive/defensive armament and excellent performance  allowed her to go beyond her reconnaissance origins and evolve into a lethal fighter platform. She achieved first flight in 1917 and entered German service the same year, ultimately being produced and fielded in number along the Western Front from 1917 to 1918. Manufacturing was handled by Luft Verkehrs Gesellschaft (aka \"LVG\").\n\r\nDesign of the C.V was highly conventional and characterized by her biplane wing assemblies. Each unstaggered wing featured two bays  and were of equal span, supported by parallel struts. The lower assembly connected at the fuselage underside while the upper assembly was supported onto the topside fuselage by way of a strut network located ahead of the pilot. Of note to the wings were the aerodynamic balances affixed to the ailerons and fitted to the upper wing assemblies. Construction consisted of a covered semi-monocoque frame. Accommodations were for two - a pilot and the observer/rear gunner - seated in tandem, open-air cockpits consistent with the times, though supplying unparalleled views obstructed only by the aircraft structure itself. The rear gunner held the better view of the critical \"six\" area behind and to the sides of the aircraft, manning a trainable machine gun for self-defense. The engine was fitted to the extreme forward end of the fuselage and powered a two-bladed propeller. The radiator was clearly identifiable by its raised \"horn\". The forward fuselage maintained an aerodynamic appearance while the middle fuselage sported slab sides. The fuselage tapered off at the extreme end of the empennage. The tail system was made up of a single, rounded vertical fin with similar horizontal tailplanes attached to the fuselage frame. The undercarriage was fixed and made up of two large-wheeled main legs supported by struts under the forward fuselage. The rear was held off the ground by way of a simplistic tailskid and came into play when the aircraft was at rest.\n\r\nPower was supplied from a single Benz Bz.IV series engine of 200 horsepower. This allowed the aircraft to achieve a maximum speed of approximately 106 miles per hour with a service ceiling equal to 21,300 feet while maintaining a rate-of-climb around 1,100 feet per minute. Mind you that these statistics were quite excellent for World War 1 standards, putting the C.V at the top end of the fighter spectrum. Endurance from the Benz powerplant was listed at about 3 hours and a half, keeping the bird \"in the fight\" longer than most.\n\r\nPrimary armament centered around a single fixed, forward-firing 7.92mm LMG 08/15 machine guns, these controlled by the pilot and aimed by positioning his entire aircraft at a target. The rear observer/gunner manned a single trainable 7.92mm Parabellum MG14 series machine gun, primarily covering the rearward areas of the aircraft. When called upon to strike at ground targets of note, the C.V could make use of up to 90lbs to 254lbs (sources seem to vary wildly) of bombs held externally. As the C.V was a reconnaissance platform first, the limited use of bombs was negligible.\n\r\nThe Polish Army  utilized some 150 captured examples after the war. Several examples (collectively numbering thirty in all) were distributed for service with the likes of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Russian Empire. Other post-war examples found a \"second-life\" as civilian movers.\n\r\nBy 1918, the last year of World War 1, the C.V was joined by the improved C.VI model - a version alone produced in 1,000 examples.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "LVG C.V", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance / Fighter Biplane Aircraft"}, {"id": "7e8d0571-12a3-48d2-af57-0ca4dcc99d6b", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Nieuport Nie.27 (or simply Nieuport 27) was designed by Gustave Delage and became an advanced trainer and frontline fighter, serving with units of the Aeronautique Militaire of France, the Royal Flying Corps of Britain and the Corpo Aeronatico Militaire of Italy during World War 1. Service for the type began in 1917 with production handled by both Nieuport of France and Nieuport-Macchi of Italy. Despite it being categorized as a fighter, the aircraft was generally utilized as an advanced trainer for most of her war-time career. The design was, in essence, a continuation of the successful Nieuport 17 of 1916 attempting to build upon the successes of the former. \n\r\nDesign of the Nie.27 ran in line with the smattering of offerings found throughout World War 1. As a biplane fighter, the Nie-27 made use of a staggered and equal-span wing assembly with the upper surface area noticeably larger than that of the lower. The lower wings were connected to the lower fuselage just below and aft of the engine mount. The upper wing sat some distance above the engine mount and was braced to the upper forward fuselage via four main struts. The wings themselves were set between the engine and the cockpit when viewed in the profile and featured V-struts in a single-bay arrangement. Nie-27s were the last Nieuport fighters to feature this type of wing strut. The engine was fitted to the extreme forward portion of the fuselage complete with a curved cowling and powered a two-blade propeller. The pilot sat in an open-air cockpit with reasonably good views. The empennage was conventional and sported a single vertical tail fin with applicable horizontal planes, all with rounded edges. The undercarriage was fixed and featured two main landing gears and a simple skid at the base of the tail.\n\r\nWhen armed, Nie.27s were fielded with Vickers (French and Italian Nie.27s) or Lewis machine guns (British Nie.27s). If a Vickers was used, a single machine gun was fitted to the forward fuselage over the engine compartment just forward of the pilot's windscreen and synchronized, via an interrupter gear, to fire through the spinning propeller blades. If a Lewis-type machine gun was utilized, the weapon was fitted to a special Foster Mount arranged atop the upper wing assembly. It was not uncommon to two machine guns on an Nie.27, though at the expense of some performance. Trainer Nie.27 mounts were unarmed.\n\r\nGeneral performance for the Nie.27 resulted in a maximum speed of 116 miles per hour with a service ceiling of approximately 18,200 feet. A rate-of-climb to 16,400 feet could be achieved in 22 minutes with an operational range of about 150 miles. Power was initially from a Le Rhone Rotary engine of 130 horsepower (as found on the Nie.24bis series) but this was oft-replaced in the trainer role by lower-rated 110- or 120-horsepower versions.\n\r\nMost all Nieuport fighters still utilizing the \"V-strut\" wing supports were given up for good during the spring fighting of 1918, eventually replaced by more able-bodied types - such was the short-lived service life of the Nieu.27.\n\r\nOperators of the aircraft included France, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia (later overtaken by the new powered governing the now-Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. For the United Kingdom, the Nie.27 served with Nos. 1, 14, 17, 29, 40, 60, 67, 111, and 113 Squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps. Poland operation of the aircraft resulted in only a single example being procured. The United States fielded the aircraft as a training mount through the American Expeditionary Force as well as the later United States Army Air Service (1918).\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Nieuport 27", "aircraft_type": "Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "54c78312-a98a-4fd6-a5c9-a2ff1affdda1", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThough the Sopwith Camel (the official designation being Sopwith Biplane F.1) was designed as a replacement for the Sopwith Pup, the Camel was in fact a further development of the type. The single-seat biplane fighter provided a pivotal punch to the Allied air campaign and saw large numbers in service by the end of February 1918. The type took part in what was believed to be the largest airborne battle of the war on November that same year. By war's end, the Camel became the most important British fighter of the conflict and would go on to achieve a respected existence in pop culture for decades to come.\n\r\nThe prototype Camel featured a Clerget 9Z engine of 110 horsepower. First flight was achieved at Brooklands in February of 1917 paving the way for a pre-production batch of F.1/3-designated models. The Camel entered frontline service in June of 1917 and immediately claimed its first air victories against the stunned German aviators unfortunate enough to square off against a capable pilot behind the Camel's controls. The major production model became the Camel F.1 (the formal Sopwith Biplane F.1 designation was largely disregarded).\n\r\nIn configuration, the Camel featured equal-span, staggered bi-plane wings (the lower with some dihedral) featuring only a single pair of parallel support struts. Construction consisted of an underlying structure made up mostly of wood covered in fabric with some light alloy skinning over the forward fuselage near the engine. The pilot sat to the rear and underneath the upper wing element. In fact, all major systems were purposefully positioned in the front 7 feet of the fuselage, this including the main landing gears, engine, wings, armament and pilot. Armament consisted of 2 x 7.7mm Vickers-type machine guns firing through the propeller via an interrupter gear (i.e. synchronized). The designation of \"Camel\" came from the hump created by the fairing over the breeches of these gun installations. Power of the F.1 model was derived from a Clerget 9B 9-cylinder rotary engine of 130 horsepower providing speeds of 115 miles per hour, a ceiling of over 20,000 feet and a range of 485 kilometers.\n\r\nIn practice, the Camel proved a handful to fly, particularly with novice pilots, so much so that it earned a nasty reputation of killing off the less-than-capable aviators. The powerful gyroscopic effect of the Clerget engine coupled with the forward-positioned center of gravity seemingly forced Camel pilots to work for the aircraft's respect. Conversely, the same torque and forward placement of all major systems improved maneuverability beyond those as showcased by her contemporaries to the point that a Camel pilot could count on a responsive right-hand turn almost at will. The natural torque generated by her engine allowed the pilot to achieve quicker turns by using this force to his advantage in a close-knit dogfight. The aircraft was, however, noted for having a particularly brutal spin effect in response to any stalls no doubt due to this very same torque effect. As production progressed, a series of engines were found aboard Camels and included the Clerget types along with the Bentley BR1, the Gnome Monosoupape and the Le Rhone 9J series.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sopwith Camel", "aircraft_type": "Single-Seat Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "b7ceee61-8438-4b79-9d87-c99f2627e865", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThe storied engineering career of Frenchman Louis Bechereau  spanned decades and several popular designs during World War 1 (1914-1918). Hired by Armand Deperdussin to head design at Societe de Production des Aeroplanes Deperdussin (\"S.P.A.D.\"), Bechereau delivered the early SPAD S.VII and later SPAS S.XIII. In between these two notable designs fell the oft-forgotten SPAD S.XI, a two-seat reconnaissance-minded biplane fighter attempting to fulfill Specification C2 for the French Air Service. The SPAD S.XI did not prove itself an outright success as other SPAD designs did and witnessed only a short shelf-life during the war, dogged by issues throughout its career. This led to a rather limited production reach of about 1,000 aircraft in the series.\n\r\nTo fulfill the French air Service (Aeronautique Militaire) requirements, Bechereau attempted to continue using the proven qualities of his previous single-seat biplane fighter offerings. A longer fuselage was necessary when incorporating a second observer's/gunner's cockpit aft of the pilot. Sections of the wings were cut out for improved viewing while many other qualities of the design remained consistent with the period - the front-mounted engine driving a two-bladed wooden propeller, parallel struts and cabling to stiffen and control the \"over-under\" wing structure and conventional single-finned tail unit. The undercarriage was wheeled though fixed through reinforced struts and the tail supported by a simple skid. The pilot was given a single fixed, forward-firing 7.7mm Vickers series machine gun and the observer could manage an optional 7.7mm Lewis machine gun on a trainable mounting. The aircraft emerged under the company model number of \"SPAD 11\", also written as SPAD S.XI.\n\r\nPower to the S.XI was served through 1 x Hispano-Suiza 8Bc series V-8 water-cooled engine of 200 horsepower and this allowed a maximum speed was 112 miles per hour with an mission endurance time of approximately 2.25 hours. The aircraft's service ceiling was listed at 23,000 feet with a rate-of-climb of 9,850 feet reached in roughly 12.5 minutes. Some airframes were also fitted with a Renault 12-cylinder engine instead of the aforementioned Hispano-Suiza installation, though this powerplant actually reduced performance figures and was not popular.\n\r\nThe SPAD S.XI joined the war during 1917 and eventually proved itself not a success. The modified single-seat fighter approach for a larger two-seat design made the airframe tricky in its handling while performance from the engine of choice proved underwhelming. The type did hold characteristics that superseded some existing types then in service with French forces so the aircraft still managed to serve in notable numbers. It managed a frontline status until the fall of 1918 before being replaced by the SPAD S.XVI - itself a direct offshoot of the S.XI though outfitted with a Lorraine-Dietrich engine of 250 horsepower. These proved no better than the originals but were kept in action nonetheless.\n\r\nOperators beyond the French Air Service became Belgium, Italy, Japan, Russia (into the Soviet Union years), Uruguay and the United States (American Expeditionary Force - \"AEF\").\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "SPAD S.XI", "aircraft_type": "Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "5dc14d61-5ca4-4881-a12a-ea20b9c04dd4", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tFrench flying ace Georges Guynemer pushed the idea of a cannon-armed fighter plane after his experiences in aircraft such as the SPAD S.VII. This led the Societe Pour l'Aviation et ses Derives (SPAD) company to develop such a system. The follow-up design came to be known as the S.XII (or S.12) and featured a 37mm cannon along with its standard single machine gun armament.\n\r\nExternally, the SPAD S.XII looked every bit as a further development of the SPAD S.VII model. Due to the extra weight imposed on the airframe by the new cannon armament, the fuselage was lengthened over that of the S.VII. A Hispano-Suiza engine was once again used by SPAD and consisted of the 8Bc or 8Bec types, each offering 220 horsepower. What made the 8Bec unique was that the 37mm cannon could be nestled between the cylinder banks. Subtle changes to the wings were also necessitated by the increase in weight.\n\r\nFirst flight for the SPAD S.XII was achieved on July 5th, 1917 with limited production examples following. The system proved a handful for the inexperienced but lethal in the hands of a proven military aviator. As the cannon system extended into the cockpit, the aircraft was not controlled through a traditional flight stick. Additionally, reloading the cannon while flying the plane added another responsibility while in-flight. The standard single 7.7mm Vickers machine gun remained a part of the offensive toolbox for the S.XII, a carry-over from the S.VII design.\n\r\nThough the cannon-mounted SPAD S.XII's initially proved successful, they really required an experienced pilot at the controls of both aircraft and armament. With more and more resources being dedicated to the already proven S.VII and S.XIII designs, the S.XII was limited to a mere 300 production examples and, as such, the system never equipped an entire unit. In any case, the idea of a cannon-armed aircraft was intriguing and perfected to the extreme in the Second World War and beyond.\n\r\nLike the SPAD S.VII before it and the SPAD S.XIII after it, the SPAD S.XII was designed by Louis Bechereau.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "SPAD S.XII", "aircraft_type": "Single-Seat, Single Engine Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "79092109-be63-410a-b2f4-eb426be10f02", "year_model": "1917", "description": "\r\n        \tThe SPAD S.XIII (S.13) was a further development of the successful SPAD S.VII (S.7) design, the latter eventually becoming outclassed by the newer and better German aircraft designs of World War 1. The S.XIII would prove a success for SPAD (Societe Pour l'Aviation et ses Derives), adding yet another fine fighter aircraft to its resume and a formidable platform to the conflict. The S.XIII featured an increased wingspan, more powerful engines and dual machine gun systems along with more subtle changes in design over the S.VII. In the end, over 8,400 examples would roll off the assembly lines.\n\r\nConfiguration of the S.XIII was similar in most respects to the S.VII before it. The pilot, wings, landing gear and engine were all mounted to the forward end of the fuselage. Construction was of an internal wood structure with a fabric covering along with light alloy used near the engine area. The biplane wings were of equal span, with the lower component aligned directly with the upper. The pilot sat to the rear of the upper wing assembly in an open-air cockpit with a forward view overlooking the twin 7.7mm Vickers machine guns - these synchronized to fire through the spinning propeller via an interrupter gear. The S.XIII achieved first flight on April 4th, 1917 and was in operational service along the frontlines by May of that year.\n\r\nIn combat, the S.XIII proved its worth (and pedigree for that matter). The aircraft was able to out-fly the German D.VII types well enough and compared favorably to even the fabled Sopwith Camel. Structurally, the S.XIII was sound enough to withstand a good deal of punishment before inevitably giving in. This structural integrity generally made diving a supreme tactic for S.XIII users. If the design sported any major flaw it was in its reduced maneuverability at slower speeds - this alone led to dangers in both combat and in bringing the aircraft in for a landing.\n\r\nNevertheless, the S.XIII proved a popular mount for allied aces including American Eddie Rickenbacker and Frenchmen Rene Fonck and Georges Guynemer (Guynemer personally making a case for an improved S.VII, eventually leading to the development of the S.XIII). The type served with air forces across the globe even in the post-war years.\n\r\nLike the S.VII before it, the S.XIII was designed by Louis Bechereau.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "SPAD S.XIII", "aircraft_type": "Single-Seat, Single-Engine Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "c8587899-c9e1-4687-a35d-c56c3abd46f1", "year_model": "1916", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Anatra D was one of the few homegrown Russian aircraft developed for the Imperial Russian Air Force and operated during World War 1 (1914-1918). The aircraft served as a twin-seat reconnaissance platform and was built in 380 examples across the major and minor variants presented. The Anatra D was the Anatra company's first original design - the concern, owned by an Italian banker in Odessa - began operations producing a local copy of French Viosin aircraft. In the case of both designs, the aircraft were not fondly remembered.\n\r\nThe Anatra D-series aircraft were attributed to Elysee Alfred Descamps.\n\r\nThe Anatra D had its first-flight on December 19th, 1915, and appeared prior to the October Revolution of 1917 that kicked the Russian Empire out of World War 1 and into internal turmoil. Its design was influenced some by the German Aviatik biplane series captured during the earlier part of the conflict and attempted to carry over some of the series' better qualities. Wood and fabric (with some steel tubing and aluminum skinning) were involved in the construction and a twin-bay biplane wing arrangement was used. The wheeled undercarriage was fixed and the engine, driving a wooden two-bladed propeller, was appropriately situated at the nose. The crew of two, in open-air cockpits, sat in tandem within the slab-sided fuselage. The tail unit was traditional - a single vertical fin with low-mounted horizontal planes.\n\r\nAs completed, the type exhibited a wingspan of 40.6 feet, a length of 26.5 feet and a height of 10.4 feet. Weight was 1,905lb empty and 2,566lb gross. Armament was centered on 2 x 7.7mm machine guns - one in a fixed, forward-firing mount (Vickers) operated by the pilot (and synchronized to fire through the spinning propeller blades) and the other on a trainable mounting for the rear gunner / observer (Lewis Gun). A modest bombload of 50 kg could also be carried aloft.\n\r\nThe Anatra D entered formal service during May 1916 and managed a career in the air until the early 1920s. To major types were produced during the period - the original D \"Anade\" model (170 examples) and the improved DS \"Anasal\" variant (184 examples - this name was formed from \"Anatra Salmson\"). The original Gnome Monosoupape rotary engines of 100 horsepower of the original aircraft proved highly unreliable and the design exhibited inherent structural weaknesses with overall shoddy construction. The DS model - first flown on July 16th, 1916) attempted to improve upon some of these deficient qualities by introducing a Salmson Canton-Unne water-cooled radial piston engine of 150 horsepower. While this helped to improve performance qualities some, it did little to endear the design to Russian airmen - who were more or less forced to fly the deathtrap under combat conditions.\n\r\nThe base aircraft design (DS model) could manage a maximum speed of 80 miles per hour up to a ceiling of 14,110 feet out to a range of 250 miles but little else. Reliability issues persisted and aircraft were known to inexplicably crash or break up in midair - leaving the Anatra aircraft to become one of the more forgettable Russian Empire aircraft ventures of World War 1. It continued for some time longer in service under the Soviet Air Force banner, at least until 1923. Other global operators became the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Czechoslovakia (postwar use of 23 aircraft), Hungary and Poland (postwar use of five aircraft).\n\r\nThe DDS was a limited-number variant fitted with the Salmson 9U radial piston engine of 160 horsepower which further increased performance figures (up to 90mph maximum speed). At least one Anatra \"Anadis\" was completed as a promising single-seat fighter in 1916 but not furthered into a serial production form.\n\r\nThe type was also in combat service during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Anatra D-Series", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance Biplane Aircraft"}, {"id": "094e27f9-10c0-4077-92a3-ca892dc8b2c8", "year_model": "1916", "description": "\r\n        \tAviation technology during World War 1 (1914-1918) moved at lightning speed as both sides attempted to gain the advantage in the skies over Europe. This led to many variants and all-new aircraft designs being fielded, some lasting just a few short months at they became quickly outclassed by enemy designs. The French-originated Nieuport line of fighters ended as a deep family tree made up of various fighting aircraft with origins in the Nieuport 10 of 1914. This product advanced through popular forms like the Nieuport 1 \"Bebe\" and the larger, more powerful two-seat Nieuport 12 model (both detailed elsewhere on this site). The Nieuport 16 (Nie 16) was an offshoot of the line, appearing in January of 1916, and brought with it a reinforced structure and a new engine fit. It went on to operate with the air services of France, Britain, Belgium (limited), Russia (locally-produced by Dux) and Italy during its brief time in the air.\n\r\nAt its core, the Nieuport 16 was the Nieuport 11 aircraft modified to accept a new, more powerful engine installation in the Le Rhone 9J rotary of 110 horsepower. However, in both form and function its appearance and battlefield role changed very little and, as such, it retained much of the capability of the earlier design. This led to an aircraft with a heavy frontal section and deteriorated handling characteristics due to high wing loading. Lacking synchronized gear, a single Lewis Gun machine gun was set over the upper wing element to help clear the spinning propeller blades and this kept the weapon awkwardly far from the pilot's reach in the event of an ammunition misfeed. The biplane wings, retained from the Nie 11, were of equal span and braced by V-struts.\n\r\nThe Nie 16 was introduced on January 5th, 1916 and operated in the fighter / bomber escort / balloon-busting role. In the latter, the V-struts supported four Le Prieur rockets to each wing for added firepower. Once available in number, the Nie 16 quickly superseded Nie 10 and Nie 11 fighters in circulation and some of the stock were eventually given Alkan synchronization gear so machine guns could be fitted to the fuselage and fired through the spinning propeller blades. Of course this also meant that even more weight was added to the frontal section of the aircraft which further worsened the \"heavy nose\" attitude already exhibited by the aircraft.\n\r\nThe Nieuport 16 was eventually superseded itself by the Nieuport 17 model (detailed elsewhere on this site) which offered improvements in both performance and handling - leaving the Nie 16 as nothing more than a stepping stone design on the road to a more viable fighter type.\n\r\nIn its finalized form, the Nie 16 showcased a maximum speed of 103 miles per hour.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Nieuport 16", "aircraft_type": "Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "341635b7-281f-4528-ae00-7d0110a8aa9f", "year_model": "1916", "description": "\r\n        \tFresh off of the heels of the success that was the Nieuport 11, the Nieuport 17 was a direct development intended to improve upon the former design. The Nieuport 11 was born of the prewar Nieuport 10 competition airplane which was abandoned as a competition mount and adopted for military service by several world powers instead. The Nieuport 11 was then a militarized version of the Nieuport 10 and retained the excellent qualities of the design including its sesquiplane biplane wing configuration, single-seat open-air cockpit and strong handling characteristics. The Nieuport 11 was critical in turning the tide of the dreaded \"Fokker Scourge\" in 1916 as it outpaced and outperformed the German monoplanes with relative ease. Nieuport then attempted to improved the Nieuport 11 even further with the Nieuport 16 though its selection of engine made for a significantly nose-heavy design. As such, next came the Nieuport 17 which ended its tenure as one of the best Allied fighter designs in all of World War 1.\n\r\nThe Nieuport 17 incorporated a dimensionally larger airframe and biplane wing assembly while retaining the same general single-seat layout. Additionally, a more powerful engine was utilize for improved performance at altitude - this being a Le Rhone 9J series 9-cylinder rotary engine of 110 horsepower. The airframe, therefore, could reach speeds of 110 miles per hour and fielded an endurance of nearly two hours while being able to fight at altitudes reaching 17,400 feet. Rate-of-climb was listed at 9,800 feet within 12 minutes.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Nieuport 17 following along the lines of accepted World War 1 fighter design. The engine and wing arrangement were all set well-ahead in the layout, the engine powering a simple two-bladed wooden propeller in a \"puller\" configuration. The upper and lower wing assemblies were of uneven span utilizing \"V-struts\". Such a wing development was traced back to the sesquiplane arrangement on the original Nieuport 10 racer which essentially identified a lower wing assembly that was decidedly smaller than the upper assembly. The wings were completed with single-bays so only a single instance of the V-strut support was apparent to either side of the fuselage. The engine compartment was covered over in a rounded metal cowling which was well-integrated into the boxy fuselage constructed primarily of canvas and wood. The open-air cockpit was situated behind and under the upper wing assembly. The fuselage tapered off at the aft end to which a single, shallow rounded vertical tailplane was fitted as well as a pair of horizontal planes. The undercarriage was fixed and consisted of two landing wheels set about a reinforced structure with a tail skid at the rear. This arrangement gave the Nieuport design a noticeable \"nose-up\" appearance when at rest. Such aircraft were also called to operate from rough airfields and did so under many circumstances during the war.\n\r\nAs one of Nieuport's famed \"fighting scouts\", the Nieuport 17 was a scout airplane primarily armed with a single machine gun. In French Air Service, the aircraft was eventually (Nieuport 17bis) fitted with a synchronizer which allowed the machine gun to be operated just ahead of the pilot, firing through the spinning propeller blades, within easy reach for clearing jams. Original production models incorporated a machine gun across the upper wing span. In British service, the type retained the upper wing machine gun fitting for the duration of their frontline service, jams cleared by lowering the machine gun to the pilot's position by mechanical means. The French utilized the Vickers series of proven aerial machine guns while the British made use of the Lewis system on a Foster mounting - both in 0.30 caliber chambering. In addition to the machine gun (and as in the Nieuport 11 before it), the Nieuport 17 was cleared to fire 8 x Le Prieur rockets against reconnaissance balloons or ground targets as required.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Nieuport 17", "aircraft_type": "Fighting Biplane Scout Aircraft"}, {"id": "3141bf8d-d178-402c-a606-593b97bce0d9", "year_model": "1916", "description": "\r\n        \tDesigned by Ukrainian aviation engineer Igor Sikorsky, the S-16 was developed to a Russian Empire requirement for a capable two-seat biplane fighter to serve as escort for the large, ponderous, multi-engined Ilya Muromets bomber. The bomber itself was a design from Sikorsky and the world's first four-engined bomber type when it appeared in 1913. Over 85 were built for the Imperial Russian Air Service and saw combat in World War 1 (1914-1918). The S-16 fighter appeared some years later and its production totals were much less. It was also recognized under the designation of RBVZ S-XVI which noted the manufacturer (\"Russo-Baltic Wagon Works\").\n\r\nExternally, the S-16 featured a conventional arrangement for the period and was constructed largely of wood with fabric skinning. An equal-span biplane wing arrangement was selected which featured single bays and parallel struts. The fuselage held slab-sides and mounted the engine in a frontal compartment shrouded over in thin metal. The tail utilized a shallow vertical fin and low-set horizontal planes. The undercarriage constituted two main legs, via a strut network, and double-wheeled bogies were seated under the center mass of the aircraft. Interestingly, the crew of two was seated side-by-side in a staggered, open-air cockpit arrangement. Initially intended to carry a French Le Rhone engine of 100 horsepower, the S-16 was instead finalized with a Gnome air-cooled rotary engine of 80 horsepower driving a two-bladed wooden propeller unit due to limited supplies of the 100 horsepower form. This would ultimately derail the fighter's performance when compared to its contemporaries. Performance specifications included a maximum speed of 75 miles per hour and a rate-of-climb nearing 410 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nArmament amounted to a single 7.7mm Lavrov (or British Vickers) type machine gun fitted over the engine cowling. The weapon was synchronized (with Lavrov synchronization gear) to fire through the spinning propeller blade marking the S-16 as one of the first combat aircraft of the war to feature this revolutionary trait. About 500 7.7mm rounds were afforded this gun.\n\r\nFirst flight of an S-16 prototype occurred on February 6th, 1915 and service introduction came during January of 1916, the stock formed from a contract order for eighteen of the type. In practice, the line was agile enough but its underperforming engine would not allow it to become a classic of the war. Additionally, the events of 1917 and the immediate period following took the Russian Empire out of its war with Germany and forced the S-16 to be used in anger against Russians themselves during the Russian Revolution. The Soviet Union was born in place of the Empire during 1922 and those S-16 aircraft that remained in service were taken into the inventory of the newly-formed Soviet Air Force. These did not survive much longer for the line was retired in full in 1923.\n\r\nBefore its end, engineers attempted several experiments through the S-16 design including an additional machine gun installation (along the upper wing), floats for water-born landings and take-offs and different wing and engine fits.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sikorsky S-16 (RBVZ S-XVI)", "aircraft_type": "Biplane Fighter / Bomber Escort Aircraft"}, {"id": "5f66d83a-978c-4ae3-9f88-b2047d3a1c21", "year_model": "1916", "description": "\r\n        \tLike other Sopwith Aviation Company aircraft, the wartime Sopwith 1-1/2 Strutter owed its existence to the arrival of the Sopwith Tabloid, a boxy, competition aircraft that sat two in a side-by-side arrangement constructed while being constructed of canvas and wood. The Tabloid design proved a success, earning speed and performance accolades that pushed it to the attention of the British military Despite its limited value as a military mount, the Tabloid nonetheless paved the way for more capable Sopwith designs to come. The 1-1/2 Strutter held two British aviation \"firsts\" when it was adopted for service - becoming its first \"puller\" engine arrangement (the engine mounted at the front of the fuselage) two-seater and its first to implement an effective machine gun synchronizer.\n\r\nBritain went to war in the summer of 1914 and all manner of aircraft were sought for the initiative. This included the Sopwith Tabloid and its floatplane derivatives, the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Schneider. While these aircraft proved adequate for their given roles of scout (sometimes being armed for the role, sometimes not), they were hardly military-grade end -products built for the rigors of war time abuses. As such, Sopwith engineers took to designing a whole new biplane fighter in the same mold though with changes to incorporate the latest in construction methods while attempting to fulfill the military requirements of a rapidly evolving war in Europe.\n\r\nCompany founder, Thomas Sopwith, along with engineers R.J. Ashfield and Herbert Smith ironed out a new aircraft fuselage with a biplane wing arrangement and inline seating for two - a pilot and an observer/gunner. The powerplant of choice was the French Clerget 9Z rotary engine of 110 horsepower. A single .303 machine gun was fitted in a fixed, forward-firing emplacement, synchronized to fire through the two-bladed spinning propeller blade via a Vickers-Challenger interruptor.

The wings were supported by struts in a conventional way through full-length, staggered parallel struts making single bays - though half-length struts were used to connect the upper wing assembly to the fuselage (known as cabane struts) and, thusly, this garnered the aircraft the nickname, and ultimately its formal designation, of \"1-1/2 Strutter\" (One-and-One Half Strutter\"). An adjustable rudder surface was added to the vertical tail fin and the wings proved notable in their implementation of pivoting surfaces which were essentially equivalent to later dive brakes.

The undercarriage was typical of biplane aircraft of the time - fixed and wheeled main legs under the forward mass and a simple skid under the tail.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sopwith Pup", "aircraft_type": "Biplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "f51e9b82-9874-43e3-876a-4b4321cf0ea2", "year_model": "1916", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sopwith Triplane (dubbed \"Triplehound\" by her pilots) was a three-wing fighter design built by the Sopwith Aviation concern of Britain and based on the strengths of the successful Sopwith \"Pup\" biplane fighter (detailed elsewhere on this site). The aircraft strayed from conventional aviation design of the time, where biplanes proved the accepted norm for most major air services, and sought to combine additional lift and maneuverability by the addition of a third wing element. This resulted in the first-ever operational deployment of a triplane fighter in the Sopwith Triplane. For a short time in World War 1 (1914-1918), the Triplane had no equal though its eventual end came with the arrival of the Sopwith Camel biplane - the classic fighter aircraft of the war. Triplanes continued to see second-line service as trainers from mid-1917 onward.\n\r\nFirst prototypes were developed during the early part of 1916 and a first-flight was recorded on May 28th, 1916. Such was the promise of the aircraft design that it was rushed to the frontlines, seeing formal service introduction as soon as December of 1916. Initial operational use was outstanding enough to warrant serial manufacture and some 147 were ultimately delivered - the primary operator being the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS).\n\r\nBeyond its triplane wing arrangement, the aircraft exhibited traditional qualities of fighters of the period - a slab-sided, tapering fuselage with open-air cockpit for one, a fixed, twin-wheeled undercarriage for ground-running, and a single-finned tail unit. To brace the three wing pattern, a thick, large strut joined the planes outboard and shorter struts connected the upper wing assembly to the upper fuselage ahead of the pilot. The pilot sat just behind the wing assemblies which did hinder visibility. However it was in maneuverability and rate-of-climb that the Triplane excelled - giving the pilot a considerable advantage in aerial firefights that were close-ranged.\n\r\nArmament was typically a single 7.7mm Vickers machine gun firing through the spinning propeller blades by way of a synchronizer. There were some attempts to field a twin-gunned version but it was found that a single gun approach was more effective - the weight gained from the addition of a second machine gun, along with its ammunition supply, degraded overall performance of the fighter.\n\r\nPower stemmed from a single Clerget 9Z series, 9cylinder rotary piston engine driving a two-bladed wooden propeller at the nose. This allowed for speeds to reach 117 miles per hour as well as a service ceiling up to 20,500 feet. The aircraft held a mission endurance window of 2.75 hours and time to 6,000 feet was nearly six minutes.\n\r\nResults for the Triplane were exceptional in the early-going - for a period in 1917 the series racked up over 100 enemy kills. However, the machines proved complicated to maintain and repair and steep diving actions often resulted in the wing elements giving way. Its single machine gun also lacked the firepower seen in other twin-gunned contemporaries. These inherent deficiencies ultimately led the Triplane to see a very short operational career over the battlefields of Europe in the war.\n\r\nNevertheless, for its time, there proved few equals. Indeed, the Germans respected the Triplane enough to put forth a reward to any German aircraft-maker that could deliver a similar fighter. Anthony Fokker responded with what would become the Fokker Dr.I Triplane (detailed elsewhere on this site). There were many other \"multi-winged\" creations (some simply aerial monstrosities as aircraft go) seen during this period as well though few ever saw the light of day.\n\r\nBeyond its service with the British Navy, the Sopwith Triplane found homes in the inventories of France (Navy), Greece (Navy, single example) and the Russian Empire (single example). The French received seventeen examples. The sole Russian Empire example fell to the Soviet Air Force when it was captured.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sopwith Triplane", "aircraft_type": "Triplane Fighter / Trainer Aircraft"}, {"id": "5e9e8dec-fb6f-465a-a4ae-eb0b8c245a0b", "year_model": "1916", "description": "\r\n        \tThe SPAD S.VII (or \"S.7\") was one of France's best single-seat fighters of World War 1 (1914-1918). The type epitomized the quintessential \"dogfighter\" in every sense of the word with its rugged qualities and solid performance figures, embodied by its appearing in extensive numbers by various air groups of the Allied powers during the conflict including those of the United Kingdom, Belgium and United States. The S.VII more or less became the first successful warplane design effort by Societe Pour l'Avions et ses Derives - otherwise known by the letters S.P.A.D. The SPAD concern was originally founded by Armand Deperdussin prior to the war in 1911 with most of its wartime designs generated by engineer Louis Becherau (including the S.VII itself), many of his aircraft serving into the 1920s and ultimately being considered \"classics\".\n\r\nDesign-wise, the SPAD VII exhibited a very conventional design layout for its time. It was a biplane design in its basic form consisting of a low wing assembly complemented by a relatively low-set high wing assembly for maximum stability, lift and visibility. The engine, powering a two-bladed wooden propeller, was set at the extreme forward end of the fuselage and covered over in light alloy. The wings and fuselage featured an internal wood structure covered over in fabric. The wings sported dual-bays with parallel struts and equal bay spans. Cabling was used extensively for both structural support and in managing the various flight control surfaces. The open-air cockpit was set just aft of the engine compartment and upper wing assembly with a simple windscreen protecting the pilot from the front. There was a short fuselage spine to help provide a headrest for minimal comfort. The open-air nature of the cockpit made for relatively excellent views despite the large complex wing arrangement allowing the pilot to raise up and peer over the aircraft sections when attempting to spot his enemy or ground target. All major internal components of the aircraft were essentially concentrated towards the front of the fuselage while the empennage was conventional with a single vertical tail fin and a pair of horizontal tail planes. The undercarriage was fixed and consisted of a pair of single-wheeled landing gear legs at the front with a simple tail skid at the rear.\n\r\nThe SPAD VII was armed rather modestly with a single 0.303 Vickers machine gun, proving adequate in engaging enemy aircraft. The machine gun was mounted ahead of the pilot, aft of the propeller and over the engine compartment - synchronized to fire through the spinning propeller blade. This placement was quite a departure from earlier Allied aircraft which saw machine guns mounted over the upper wing assembly as no viable synchronizing feature had yet been perfected. The pilot now had access to his machine gun within relatively easy reach to help clear jams of the ammunition feed. Inline with many similar aircraft of the type, the SPAD VII fielded no other armament options.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "SPAD S.VII", "aircraft_type": "Single-Seat.

The system served initially with the French air force but was put to good use in the hands of British, Italian and Russian pilots thereafter. Produced in two variants (the earlier B.2 and the later A.2) the Caudron G.4 appeared to the tune of some 1,421 total aircraft.\n\r\nThe G.4 was developed from the similar G.3 reconnaissance series as a dedicated bomber platform. From the outset, the design centered around how much of a bombload the aircraft could maintain whilst provided for decent flight characteristics. Power was derived mainly from twin Le Rhone rotary-type engines producing some 80 horsepower each. The engines proved better than those used on the G.3 series and allowed for an additional crewmember to be seating in the nose with a defensive machine gun and a capable bomb load underwing.\n\r\nThe G.4 design was characterized not only by its twin-engine layout and biplane wing assembly but also by the four rudder system mounted at rear. The two-person crew consisted of a pilot and a gunner/observer. Defensive armament was limited to usually the one 7.7mm machine gun and the bombload capacity varied between 220lb and 250lb.\n\r\nThe appearance of the G.4 was delayed by production problems, not surprising considering the aircraft was in its relative infancy at the time and designing during wartime added a new element of thinking. The G.4 first appeared in the skies for service in 1915 as the Cau 4B.2. This particular model, however, suffered from an extremely high loss rate and would be phased from service by November of 1916. The Cau 4A.2 followed and was put to more successful use in the reconnaissance and artillery spotting role.\n\r\nThe Cau G.4 was produced in Britain as well as France and was used by the major Allied powers including Russia. British flyers used the type to continually disrupt seaplane and Zeppelin airship bases throughout Belgium with good success while the Italians utilized the high altitude performance of the aircraft to good effect in the Alps. The French and Russian both utilized the type in the reconnaissance role where the onboard radio proved useful in the artillery spotting role as well.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Caudron G.4", "aircraft_type": "Heavy Bomber Biplane Aircraft"}, {"id": "0eb538db-0dad-416c-bd95-f6f316d85187", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Russian Empire did not field many indigenous aircraft designs during World War 1, instead relying on purchase or local production of foreign-born types. One locally-designed system, however, became the oft-forgotten Lebed Type XII, a practical two-seat reconnaissance biplane that saw only a few hundred produced do to lingering issues. The Lebed manufacturing facility was based in St. Petersburg, Russia and previously handled reconstitution of captured/recovered Imperial German aircraft as well as license production of British Sopwith Tabloids. The Lebed Type XII, therefore, attempted to put into practice the methodology and techniques displayed by competing foreign examples.\n\r\nWorld War 1 began in the summer of 1914 with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Serbia on June 28th. Austria-Hungary then declared war on Serbia on July 28th which prompted Russia to mobilize its forces. Germany followed this mobilization by declaring war on Russia on August 1st. Russia joined the Triple Entente which included France and Britain while Germany joined Austria-Hungary and Italy to form the Central Powers (though Italy did not enter the war at this time).\n\r\nFully committed to the great gamble by 1915, the Russian concern of Lebed began work on a new reconnaissance biplane to which a prototype was made ready by December. The prototype was powered by a 130 horsepower engine. The aircraft underwent testing throughout the early part of 1916 and proved satisfactory enough to warrant a production order for 400 units in February. However, in April the contract was amended to reduced the count to 225 aircraft. It was also suggested that a more powerful 150 horsepower engine be fitted to offset handling issues encountered during evaluation which necessitated some considerable changes to the aircrafts design while also delaying production. Testing of a revised form continued into October before production-quality systems were delivered in early 1917.\n\r\nThe Type XII included seating for two crew, a pilot in the front open-air cockpit and an observer/gunner in a rear open-air cockpit (tandem seating). Its structure consisted of wood and fabric construction while steel tubing was used in the tail section. The method was essentially garnered from the captured German examples and utilized to good effect by Russian engineers. The general layout was conventional with the engine fitted to a forward-most compartment, the cockpits aft of the engine and a traditional tail unit sporting a single tail fin and a pair of horizontal planes. The undercarriage consisted of two landing wheels affixed to struts in the usual fashion. The tail was supported by a simple skid. As a biplane aircraft, the Type XII made use of an upper and lower wing assembly, these joined by a network of parallel struts and cabling.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Lebed Type XII", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance Aircraft"}, {"id": "b88fdac0-3148-4ef5-9b1e-8c3b44fd0f36", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tPrior to production of military aircraft, the LVG concern (\"Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft\") was focused on manufacture of dirigibles which proved useful in reconnaissance sorties and artillery spotting, however vulnerable they were to ground and aircraft fire. The LVG B-series of aircraft became the company's first foray into military aviation and consisted of a lightweight two-seat biplane design which saw service in World War 1. Categorized as a reconnaissance aircraft, the system and its crew were charged with reconnoitering over enemy held territory, detailing enemy movements and positions in after-action reports and debriefings alike. Unlike later two-seat reconnaissance platforms encountered during the war, the B-series was unarmed and wholly susceptible to all kinds of aerial and ground dangers.\n\r\nThe initial production model, the B.I, was of a typical biplane configuration with an upper and lower wing assembly of unequal span joined together by various struts and cabling. The wings sported double bays with parallel struts and shorter supports at the fuselage. The engine was fitted at the extreme forward end of the fuselage with a conventional three-plane tail section at the rear. Power was supplied by a Mercedes D.I series inline liquid-cooled piston engine developing 100 horsepower. This supplied the aircraft with  a top speed of 65 miles per hour with a four-hour endurance window. The pilot and his observer sat in tandem aft of the cockpit and under the upper wing assembly - the pilot in the rear and the observer to his front. The undercarriage consisted of two main landing gear wheels supported by struts under the main bulk of the fuselage and a tail skid at the rear. As stated above, the B.I was unarmed.\n\r\nThe German Luftstreitkrafte (air force) took deliveries of the B.I and, shortly thereafter, LVG began offering an improved form under the new designation of \"B.II\". This version introduced a more powerful Mercedes inline engine outputting 120 horsepower. Additionally, the upper wing assembly sported a \"cut-out\" section intended to better the views from the pilot's position. A trainer derivative - the \"B.III\" - was also introduced to help train upcoming pilots in the nuances of flight. The B.III was given a reinforced understructure to help contend with \"rough flying\".\n\r\nDue to the inherent limitations of the aircraft line as a whole and advancing aeronautical technology throughout the war, the B-series was eventually removed from active frontline reconnaissance duties and relegated primarily to training. From then on, it was formally replaced by more capable types.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "LVG B (Series)", "aircraft_type": "Unarmed Reconnaissance Scout / Trainer Biplane Aircraft"}, {"id": "230e733e-1cb7-4064-9f6d-e62740874ae6", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Moraine-Saulnier Type N (or simply \"Moraine-Saulnier N\") was a French fighter aircraft of the First World War. It appeared in limited production numbers (just 49 total aircraft) and was quickly replaced by more advanced platforms. The aircraft was in itself a great aerodynamic triumph utilizing an air-deflecting spinner at the front of the design and wing-warping (a Wright Brothers patented design technique) instead of moving surface planes more common in other aircraft of the war.\n\r\nThe Type N entered service in 1915. It appeared as an advanced aerodynamic monoplane design with most of the fuselage width dedicated to the Le Rhone 9C rotary piston engine of 110 horsepower. Wings were held well-forward in the design and mounted high. Landing gear were made up of two bicycle type wheels, also held forward. The pilot sat directly aft of the engine placement in an open-air cockpit with a clean look over the nose and under the wings, nothing but a small windshield to deflect oncoming debris. The distinct propeller spinner was the most notable part of the Type N's design as it lent the aircraft a design look well ahead of its time. Unfortunately for posterity's sake, it was soon found that the large metal spinner was actually the cause of engine overheating and was removed from future deliveries. This effectively solved all engine heating issues for the Le Rhone but removed one of the most ingenious parts of the aircraft in the process. Interestingly enough, the removal of the component did little in the way of enhancing or decreasing the aircraft's overall performance specs.\n\r\nArmament consisted of a single .303 caliber machine gun which could be interchangeably of a Vickers or Hotchkiss design. At this time, synchronized or interrupted firing of machine guns through the propeller blades was generally still being reviewed and developed, forcing the Type N to take make-shift approach developed by Raymond Saulnier himself. The machine gun fired directly into the spinning propeller blades with each blade mounting deflector wedges. The wedges were known to decrease the performance of the spinning blade somewhat but allowed for firing of the machine gun nonetheless.\n\r\nIn essence, the operator could fire his machine gun at leisure though the actual amount of projectiles getting through the spinning blades would seemingly become random and hardly practical in a dogfight - still, the idea fared better than carrying rifles and pistols aloft. Though both sides inevitably released their synchronized firing mechanisms into the war, the Germans would get credited with first use of the concept via their Fokker platform in 1915. Interruptible machine gun systems would see use up until the Korean War, to which the jet age revolutionized every facet of dog fighting from there on.\n\r\nThe Morane-Saulnier Type N was utilized by French Air Forces (as the MS.5C.1) along with the British (referring to it as the \"Bullet\" for its spinner attachment) and the Imperial Russian Air Service. In practice, the aircraft proved to be a handful to fly and land. The wing-warping approach no doubt added to the operational dangers and it would take a well-trained pilot to fly the machine for any length of time. A high landing speed was reported, adding yet another element of danger for the man at the controls.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Morane-Saulnier Type N", "aircraft_type": "Single-Seat, Single-Engine Monoplane Fighter Aircraft"}, {"id": "214678df-a6f7-4d52-967c-de289c235528", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Nieuport 11 \"Bebe\" (or \"Baby\" - known officially as the \"Nieuport 11 C1\") was one of the first true Allied fighters of World War 1. Developed from a prewar design intended for competition, the militarized form brought with it the expected excellent performance inherent in a racing platform. Designed in a mere four months, the Nieuport 11 - retaining the \"Bebe\" nickname of its predecessor - proved instrumental in ending the dominance of German Fokker-based aircraft during 1916 in what came to be known as the \"Fokker Scourge\". The French Nieuport series, as a whole, would end up becoming one of the best fighter lines in all of World War 1, eventually becoming collectively recognized by the name of \"Nieuport Fighting Scouts\".\n\r\nSociete Anonyme Des Etablissements, established in 1909 and founded by Eduoard de Nie Port, had delved successfully into racing sesquiplane airframes for some time prior to World War 1. The sesquiplane approach was something of a biplane configuration though the lower wing assembly was decidedly smaller than the upper. With the war reaching its stride by August of 1914, and a growing faith in biplane winged aircraft, the Nieuport firm was charged with production of Voisan biplane aircraft which sported a \"pusher\" propeller arrangement, necessitated by the lack of a competent machien gun synchronization system when firing through a spinning propeller. These platforms proved adequate attempts at countering German fighter designs of the time but German offerings were seemingly always one step ahead which helped to maintain the tactical advantage for the interim.\n\r\nNieuport Chief Designer Gustave Delage began designing a new type of biplane prior to World War 1 which would have competed in the 1914 Gordon Bennett Trophy Race. The aircraft was of a sesquiplane wing arrangement and given the company designation of \"Nieuport 10\". However, with France's commitment to open war in the middle of 1914, thought turned to developing the single-seat Nieuport 10 into a militarized form capable of competing with German offerings on equal terms. The aircraft's staggered wing configuration required support of distinctive V-aligned struts and applicable wire bracing - the latter common to aircraft of the period. The Nieuport 10 was itself adopted as a general purpose mount (sometimes armed with an upper wing Lewis machine gun) and two-seat trainer platform by the French Air Force during the war. It garnered the nickname of \"Bebe\" - or \"Baby\" - a name that stuck with the militarized version for the span of her operational career. The Nieuport 10 was further adopted by Britain, Belgium, Brazil, Finland, Italy, Japan, Russia, Serbia, Thailand, Ukraine, the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\r\nIn the new militarized form, Delage attempted to retain much of the excellent performance specifications inherent in the preceding competition-minded racer. This approach would lay the foundation for a whole line of excellent French fighting aircraft still to come and make the Nieuport name a household brand by war's end. Delage's pursuit eventually realized the \"Nieuport 11\", a lightweight, single-seat fighter-type with the same single-bay sesquiplane wing arrangement of the Nieuport 10. The Nieuport 11 was the quintessential fighter of its time featuring a fixed two-wheel undercarriage with tail skid, an open-air cockpit and biplane wings. The aircraft owed its fine lines, smooth contours and general pedigree to the Nieuport racer prior and were fielded with a front-mounted 80 horsepower Le Rhone 9C, 9-cylinder, air-cooled rotary piston engine powering a two-blade propeller. The pilot sat positioned just behind and below the upper wing element with a generally good view out of the cockpit.\n\r\nPrimary armament was a single Hotchkiss- or Lewis-type 7.7mm (.303 caliber) machine gun fitted in the center of the upper wing as the Allies still lacked a viable synchronized machine gun solution that the Germans were already operating with. However, early Nieuport 11s were not armed in any way, being true scouts in their reconnaissance role (primarily with British and French scout squadrons). Only when armed did they become \"fighting scouts\" and could be operated in a fighter-type role when countering enemy aircraft and balloons. The Nieuport 11 was later cleared to fire up to 8 x Le Prieur anti-balloon rockets - these weapons, crude by modern standards, looked like nothing more than oversized bottle rockets fitted in a staggered arrangement along the sides of the V-struts.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Nieuport 11 (Bebe)", "aircraft_type": "Fighting Scout Biplane Aircraft"}, {"id": "42f15cc6-fa2f-4383-8731-efb19d198219", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tAir superiority became a back-and-forth affair for the air services involved in World War 1 (1914-1915). This opened the field of military aviation for a slew of companies to make their mark on history. The famous French concern of Nieuport became a prominent player in the war and revealed its first purpose-built fighter through the Nieuport 11 \"Bebe\" of 1915. The Bebe held its origins in the earlier Nieuport 10 of 1914 and both aircraft were designed by Gustave Delage beginning his successful wartime career for the Frenchman.\n\r\nWhile the single-seat Nieuport 10 begat the popular single-seat Nieuport 11 model, it also formed the basis of a new production mark in the two-seat Nieuport 12 - conceived of as an artillery reconnaissance platform and fighting scout before ending her days as a trainer. The \"Model 12\" became essentially a dimensionally larger version of the Model 10 with a new engine installation. It followed typical biplane design of the period with a front-mounted engine driving a two-blade propeller, an upper and lower wing assembly, and a traditional single-finned tail unit. It sat two crew in tandem with the pilot under the upper wing mainplane and the rear gunner/observer aft of the structure.  A consistent physical design quality of these early Delage aircraft was their use of \"V-struts\" between the upper and lower wing spans. The undercarriage was fixed with wheels under center mass and a simple tailskid at the rear. Power could be served through either a Clerget or Le Rhone engine developing 110 to 130 horsepower output depending on installation.\n\r\nAs an armed scout, the Nieuport 12 was fitted with a .303 Lewis machine gun at the rear cockpit. This gun sat on a Nieuport/Scraff ring to allow it to be trained on incoming enemy threats from the vulnerable rear areas of the aircraft. A second Lewis gun was sometimes fitted over the upper wing element and within reach of the rear gunner - allowing for some frontal offensive \"punch\".\n\r\nThe Nieuport 12 series was produced in a variety of countries throughout its service life but primarily, during the war years, by both France and the United Kingdom (through Beardmore). British models replaced their rear cockpit Nieuport gun rings with the Scarff type system and a .303 Vickers was installed for the pilot.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Nieuport 12", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance / Fighter / Trainer Aircraft"}, {"id": "db183954-83ca-4297-aae0-833dff5fd5ab", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tDeveloped in the mold of a \"fighting scout\", the French-originated SPAD S.A served in the armed reconnaissance role for a short time during World War 1 (1914-1918). The series was introduced during 1915 at a time when  viable synchronization/interrupter gear (allowing a machine gun to fire through spinning propeller blades) was still a way off for the Allies. Societe Pour L'Aviation et ses Derives (S.P.A.D.) delivered the A-series scout as a hasty solution with adequate frontal firepower previous attempts lacked. It sat its observer/gunner in an open-air nacelle ahead of the nose and propeller blade/engine - the pilot maintained control of the airplane from a traditional placement aft and under the upper wing assembly.\n\r\nThe SPAD S.A marked the first military aircraft entry for the company which would go on to make some of the more classic biplane fighters of the entire conflict.\n\r\nInitial production models were the A.1s and eleven examples followed to this standard, outfitted with the Le Rhone 9C of 80 horsepower driving a two-bladed wooden propeller unit. The propeller turned behind the gunner's position and his nacelle was made detachable/foldable (down) to allow clearance for starting or maintaining the engine. A wire mesh mounted aft of the gunner was used to screen him from the dangerous blades directly behind him and to also protect the blades from foreign debris incoming. To aspirate the engine, intakes were built into and around the nacelle. The base crew numbered two and armament was a sole 0.303 inch Lewis machine gun fitted to a trainable mounting at the nose. This weapon was fed from the conventional Lewis Machine Gun ammunition drum.\n\r\nNext came the A.2 variant which introduced the Le Rhone 9J air-cooled 9-cylinder rotary engine developing 110 horsepower. Performance indicated a maximum speed of 112 kilometers per hour with a service ceiling up to 3,000 meters.\n\r\nThe A.3 was a dual-control trainer carrying the 9J engine as well and armament was increased to 2 x 0.303 Lewis guns - one per crewman. Two were built in this form. The A.4, based on the A.2 standard, carried the 9C engine of the A.1 and production totaled 59 examples. The S.D was a \"one-off\" entry that was dimensionally larger than previous iterations and a second machine gunner added to a new open-air tub behind the pilot. The engine was a Renault 98Fg series of 220 horsepower output.\n\r\nAt least two aircraft made up the S.G variant which replaced the gunner with nacelle-mounted machine guns. One was a new-build aircraft while the other modified from the existing stock. The S.H was a proposed form which fell to naught as a production fighter - however it lay the groundwork for future SPAD biplane fighters to an extent.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "SPAD S.A", "aircraft_type": "Biplane Fighter / Reconnaissance Aircraft"}, {"id": "45a93b03-68d6-481d-8954-3e0a4563b43d", "year_model": "1915", "description": "\r\n        \tThe French Voisin Type 5 bomber was developed from the proven Voisin III series and saw action in the First World War. Though the III series accomplished what was expected from it, it soon became apparent that aircraft with larger bomb loads were more appropriate for the changing face of the fronts. The III series was used as the basis of a new class of bomber featuring a stronger airframe and more powerful engines among other subtle engineering changes. This new development was now classified as the Voisin Type 5 and served for a time alongside the III models eventually replacing them on the production lines. Valued for a short time, the Type 5 was eventually relegated to bomber training and limited bombing sorties.\n\r\nOn the whole, the Voisin Type 5 (or simply \"Voisin 5\" or \"Type 5\") was a single engine aircraft powered by a \"pusher-type\" propeller arrangement mounted to the rear of a central nacelle. Wings were of the biplane variety - with the top assembly shifted forward - and stemmed from the rear of the nacelle over and under the engine placement. The empennage consisted of Vee-shaped cable-and-strut arrangement leading to the extreme rear where a single vertical tail fin was located, crossing an elongated elevator. The undercarriage was of a quadruple type and remained static in flight, one wheel to a landing gear strut. Seating consisted of a single pilot/gunner/bombardier seated in the forward portion of the nacelle just forward of the engine mounting. This forward position - offering up unparalleled views - held the standard primary armament that consisted of a single 7.7mm machine gun or a 1 x 37mm cannon. Up to 132 pounds of external stores in the form of bombs could be carried. Aside from this base Type 5 model, other developments included an experimental twin engine model appearing for a short time. This particular airframe was used to test a \"pusher-puller\" engine design layout approach (one engine pulling the aircraft whilst the other pushed it along) to the existing airframe but apparently came to naught.\n\r\nIn action, the Type 5 held its own for the most part but were not very highly sought after by pilots as the weapon she was marketed to be. Despite the beneficial additions and changes to the III series design, the Type 5 was not that much better than the design it replaced. Performance gains were minimal and the increase in power led only to a small increase in overall payload capacity. In the end, yet another attempt at a pusher-type aircraft produced very little operational fruit for the system proved to have some very serious inherent drawbacks including susceptibility to rear attack (no defensive armament was afforded the rear as the engine took up this space) and a single crewmember was expected to fill three onboard roles at once.

At its core, the aircraft was a traditional biplane with its engine mounted at front and seating for one just aft. It was used primarily in the reconnaissance role serving warplanners and ground commanders with relatively up-to-date information on enemy positions and movements while also supporting artillery-spotting and the like. The G.3 first flew in prototype form prior to the war in late-1913 and was introduced in time for combat during 1914. It went on to stock various air services beyond that of the French including the United States, Poland, and Finland.\n\r\nOutwardly, the G.3 appeared a largely awkward design due to its use of a stubby, short, slab-sided centralized nacelle housing engine, fuel stores, and pilot. The nacelle sat between the upper and lower wing assemblies in the biplane arrangement with the upper wing assembly noticeably wider in span than that of the lower - this quality termed \"sesquiplane\", the idea being that drag between the wings was lessened during flight. Early versions of the aircraft relied on basic \"wing warping\" for control until ailerons were added in later production models that followed. The engine at front drove a two-bladed wooden propeller in a \"puller\" arrangement. No fixed, forward-firing machine guns - and hence no interrupter gear - were fitted to these early aircraft to allow for firing through the spinning propeller blades. The aircraft featured twin tailbooms which were left in their basic skeletal framework (uncovered) with twin, shark-fin-like rudders featured along with a wide-spanning horizontal plane. The undercarriage was fixed and sported two main, twin-wheeled landing gear legs under the forward mass of the aircraft. A network of struts was seen across the undercarriage for support while the wing elements were joined by parallel struts and wiring.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Caudron G.3", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance / Trainer Aircraft"}, {"id": "80a3ab9b-c403-4014-91fe-535b9079c693", "year_model": "1914", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Farman MF.11 \"Shorthorn\" was a development of French aeronautical engineering and was essentially an early-war biplane design fielding limited armament and a rear-mounted, rear-facing engine. The MF.11 came about before the Triple Entente (the \"allies\" of World War 1) had developed the synchronized interrupter gear that allowed machine guns to fire through a spinning propeller. As such, she was fitted with her engine at the rear of the nacelle in what was known as a \"pusher\" arrangement (in contrast, conventional prop aircraft utilized \"puller\" engine arrangements) freeing up the frontal area for armament and generally unfettered views. Officially designated as the Farman MF.11 after her designer - Maurice Farman of Farman Aviation Works - she eventually became better known by the nickname of \"Shorthorn\", this name having been derived from the preceding MF.7 \"Longhorn\" design though lacking the forward elevator assembly and forward skids of the original. The MF.11 would become the first armed aircraft platform to participate in aerial warfare in World War 1.\n\r\nFarman Aviation Works was founded by brothers Henri and Maurice and undertook the construction of aircraft from 1908 up until 1936. In 1941, after the French nationalization of aerospace industries, the firm remerged as the Societe Anonyme des Usines Farman (SAUF). By 1944, the company was officially absorbed by Sud-Ouest. Despite Marcel Farman's (Maurice's son) attempt to resurrect the family firm in 1952, the new company was deemed a failure by 1956.\n\r\nThe MF.11 featured a centralized, open-air nacelle housing the engine compartment and positions for two crew seated in tandem as well as placement for defensive armament and applicable flight control systems. The nacelle sat suspended within the network of interplane parallel struts and necessary cables with the upper wing assembly overhead of the crew and the lower wing assembly running under. The nacelle itself was slab-sided with a rounded front end topped by a small windscreen. Construction was typical of the time with a wood frame covered over in tight canvas.  Struts extended out from the upper and lower wing assemblies to generate rudimentary support for the empennage (tail section) to which was affixed a large-area horizontal plane mounting a pair of vertical tail fins. The engine was situated ahead of the tail system and aft of the crew, powering a simple two-bladed wooden propeller. The undercarriage of the airframe was typical World War 1 - a collection of double-tired, bicycle-type wheels held in place by a network of reinforced struts, these supports attached to the underside of the lower wing assembly. Each landing gear \"leg\" was afforded a ski-type structure to help prevent \"nose-over\" accidents while on the ground. There was no tail wheel, rear support being provided by a simple tailskid. This gave the MF.11 a noticeable \"nose-up\" appearance when at rest.\n\r\nIn her early production form, the MF.11 sat the pilot at the front of the aircraft with the observer to his  rear. While this afforded the pilot unobstructed and unsurpassed views of the upcoming terrain, this severely restricted defensive options and viewpoints for the observer who sometimes doubled as a machine gunner when his position was armed as such. It was only in the revised MF.11bis that the seating arrangement was reversed, giving the observer/gunner a better view with a better field-of-fire at the front of the nacelle while relocating the pilot and the flight controls to the rear. Machine guns generally ranged in the 7.5mm caliber but were often the model and make of the respective operating country (Hotchkiss, Lewis and Fiat types were known to be used).\n\r\nLike many other aerial implements of World War 1, the rickety MF.11 led a relatively short life on the Front, quickly being outclassed and outmoded by the new German Fokker monoplane in 1915. Once her period of usefulness as a frontline system was over, the MF.11 - and all her family - was generally relegated to trainer duties for upcoming aviation personnel. Nevertheless, the Farman design was an important contributor to early operations for both France, Britain, Italy and Russia in the early stages of the air war over Europe.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Farman MF.11 Shorthorn", "aircraft_type": "Reconnaissance / Bomber Aircraft"}, {"id": "123ffb37-8d9e-416e-870a-9bf4d65b40b7", "year_model": "1914", "description": "\r\n        \tLong before the Sopwith name became associated with the war-winning Sopwith \"Camel\" biplane fighter of World War 1 (1914-1918), the company entered the aero-business by developing racing aircraft. This was embodied by the Sopwith \"Tabloid\", an early biplane-winged form which first-flew in November of 1913 and was formally introduced in 1914. Though not intended as a combat warplane from the outset, it type was impressive enough by 1914-standard that it was pressed into such service when Britain declared war on the German Empire.\n\r\nAs designed, the aircraft seated its crew of two in a side-by-side, open-air cockpit. The cockpit was located behind the upper wing assembly which ran over the lower span. These elements were braced by the usual combination of cabling and parallel struts (warping was used for lateral controlling). The engine was fitted to the forward section of the aircraft in the usual way and nearly all of the powerplant was covered over in a metal, aerodynamically-refined cowl. The fuselage was given a slab-sided appearance consistent with aircraft of the period and the undercarriage was fixed during flight (a floatplane/seaplane derivative - the \"Schneider\" racer - sported large pontoons under center mass and carried a smaller pontoon under the tail). The aircraft utilized basic wood-and-canvas construction though some aluminum was present near the engine section.\n\r\nIn its original form, the Tabloid flew with a French Gnome \"Lambda\" rotary-piston engine of 80 horsepower output turning a two-bladed wooden propeller at the nose. Trials over Farnborough saw the type reach speeds in the lower 90mph range and endurance could surpass two hours. Interested in such astounding capabilities for the time, the British government contracted for forty of the aircraft to be built for military service.\n\r\nThe Schneider racer form of 1914, with its pontoon equipment and all, was entered into the Schneider air races and flew with a Gnome Monosoupape 9-cylidner engine of 100 horsepower. During the speed trials that followed, the Tabloid showcased its performance well above that of the participating competitors and a star in aerial racing was born. During the action, pilot Howard Pixton claimed a new air record (regarding seaplanes) as he hit speeds of 92 miles-per-hour toward the end of the circuit.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sopwith Tabloid", "aircraft_type": "Racing Biplane-Seaplane / Military Scout / Light Bomber Aircraft"}, {"id": "d32400d8-e877-4282-baf7-395f7b0f89b0", "year_model": "1913", "description": "\r\n        \tThe British-originated Avro \"Type 504\" biplane series of aircraft would become the most-produced and influential aircraft designs of the World War 1 period, being fielded from 1913 into the early part of the 1930s. The design's service originally began as an armed reconnaissance biplane until, eventually, the outmoded series was relegated to the training role with the arrival of new and better-performing fighter aircraft seen in The Great War. However, it was in this new role that the Avro 504 would go on to make a name for itself with the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and others for decades to come.\n\r\nThe Avro Type 504 followed tried-and-true design and construction practices for its make-up and was centered around a single engine biplane (over-under) design. Depending on the production variant, the aircraft could seat one or two crewmen and machine gun armament was usually 1 x 7.7mm Lewis machine gun on a trainable, rear-facing mounting at the rear cockpit. Both cockpit positions were of the open-air variety. The aircraft could further be armed with conventional drop bombs at underwing hardpoints for ground-attack sorties. Early production models also contained a landing skid in addition to its fixed landing gears for additional support when landing, though this assembly was removed in future operational forms when found to add little.\n\r\nIts single Gnome rotary-based engine developed 80 horsepower though, in practice, it was closer rated to 60 horsepower driving a two-bladed propeller unit at the nose. Performance figures (Type 504K) included a maximum speed of 95 miles-per-hour though cruising was closer to 75 mph. Range was out to 250 miles and its service ceiling reached 16,000 feet. Rate-of-climb was near 700 feet-per-minute.\n\r\nThe legacy of the Type 504 began when a further development of the Avro \"Type 500\" basic trainer biplane was drawn up. An order was then placed by the British Royal Navy and Army services and pushed the Type 504 in formal operational service during 1913, just prior to the events beginning the First World War. Early combat experience saw the Type 504 conduct limited strikes against enemy ground targets with the more-than-occasional Zeppelin-busting sortie mixed in. Though a relative success in these critical roles, the advancing technology of the war meant that the Type 504 was drawn back to airman training as soon as 1914 - the year the war began.\n\r\nDespite this, the Type 504 proved to be a versatile performer as proven by the myriad of variants manufactured and operated and these would, in turn, produce minor structural revisions, new designations for specialized roles, and a plethora of engine fittings. The Type 504K model represented the two-seat version while the 504C was a specialized anti-Zeppelin gunnery platform. The addition of float components in place of the traditional undercarriage produced the Type 504L floatplane while the Type 504M was a transport-minded development. By the end of the war, the series was still in serial production, such was its importance to the British war effort, and would see nearly 600 more units added to the existing grand total of 10,000+ between the years of 1925 and 1932. Newer mounts were designated Type 504N and were of either new-build or conversion measures, the latter pulled form existing stocks of Type 504 aeroplanes. For the British, Type 504s would eventually be superceded by the Avro \"Tutor\" biplane series in the same training role.\n\r\nIn the end, the remarkable Type 504 series would become one of the most impressive and respected aircraft of its generation. Many-a-military pilot certainly \"owed his wings\" to having trained on the platform at one point or another and many more civilian pilots would join them throughout the post-war period. The Type 504 would become a mainstay of the famous \"Barnstorming\" touring groups of the 1920s-1930s as well as going on to become prized collector pieces for avid flyers able to afford the type.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Avro 504", "aircraft_type": "Biplane Reconnaissance / Biplane Trainer Aircraft"}, {"id": "d703292a-bc25-4091-8062-2cd17a43f51c", "year_model": "1913", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Sikorsky Ilya Mourometz series of aircraft were the world's first four-engine bombers in operational service. Igor Sikorsky, his name synonymous in the modern world for the company's line of American helicopters, was already making a name for himself in Russia as chief designer at the Russo-Baltic Railroad Factory. There, he developed the world's first four-engine aircraft - the 1913 Russky Vitaz (S-21). This spawned the basic design for the Bolshoi Bal'tisky (\"Great Baltic\") Type B aircraft which flew for ten minutes on May 13th, 1913. The Bolshoi Bal'tisky became the basis of the larger Ilya Mourometz (S-22). \n\r\nThe aircraft was conceived of as a four-engine, luxury commercial passenger transport featuring such revolutionary amenities as cabin windows, an in-flight berth  complete with a washroom, a heated and lit passenger compartment separated from the crew cockpit and relatively comfortable passenger seating for up to 16 on wicker chairs. The cabin floor was also glazed over to allow for a unique passenger perspective of high-altitude flight. Doors on either side of the fuselage permitted mechanics to service and repair the engines in flight.\n\r\nThough hardly a spacious aircraft by today's standards, the Ilya Mourometz (IM) was ahead of its time in many ways, much to the credit of Sikorsky's forward-thinking vision. Electricity for the cabin was provided for by a wind-powered generator while heating was accomplished through radiators. First flight of the Ilya Mourometz was achieved on December 13th, 1913 while the aircrafts first passenger flight occurred a short time later on February 25th, 1914. In this event, 16 passengers were carried over Moscow for five hours, hitting an altitude of just over 6,500 feet and reaching speeds over 60 miles per hour. Production was handled at the Russo-Baltic Carriage Factory (RBVZ) in Riga beginning in 1913.\n\r\nDesign of the IM was dominated by her large unequal-span biplane wings with vertical struts and heavy cabling. The wings fitted over and under the central fuselage nacelle which contained the glazed cockpit (appearing much like a glass box) and passenger compartment. The four engines were placed between the top and bottom wing spars and each featured two-blade propellers. The IM proved a large design to say the least, towering some two stories from the top wing to the bottom of the wheels when at rest. The fuselage was a conventional straight surfaced design while the empennage was distinctive in incorporating three vertical tail fins along with a traditional tailplane surface. The undercarriage was fixed and featured two main landing gears and a tail skid.\n\r\nDuring development, the IM was test flown around the nearby areas of the Russian Imperial Capital to much fanfare. Distance flights were a common display of any new aircraft development in an effort to showcase capabilities and work out any design kinks. One such flight occurred from June 30th to July 12th, 1914 - a single-stop, 14.5-hour, round trip flight from St. Petersburg to Kiev. The arrival was noted for an engine fire that was put out in-flight while the return trip was without incident. Some unstable air forced the crew to fly above the clouds at times, this being accomplished without any sort of access to visible navigation markers on the ground.\n\r\nIt seemed as though Sikorky's vision of the IM as the world's first dedicated, four-engine passenger transport was all but fulfilled until the arrival of World War 1. Sikorsky worked with the Russian Ministry of War to adapt his new aircraft to become the world's first purpose-designed strategic bomber. Supply of the German Argus engine series was in doubt so the Russians were forced, in some cases, to use the less-capable French-made Salmson series. Ten such aircraft were ordered for military use followed by a further 80 as the war progressed. These converted bombers were now armed with a variety of defensive machine gun and cannon armament while the passenger compartment was revised to take on internal racks for bombs. Protection in the form of armor (as thick as 5mm) was allocated to the engines. The aircraft was accepted into Russian Air Force service in August of 1914 and was formed into the world's first dedicated bomber squadron, Eskadra Vozdushnykh Korablei (\"Squadron of Flying Ships\") in February of 1915. Deliveries of the first of 10 IM bombers began on December 10th, 1914.\n\r\nSince the origins of Sikorky's aircraft lay in a commercial passenger venture, there were no military-trained personnel available to teach incoming IM recruits the subtleties of the large aircraft. As such, civilian pilots with IM flight experience were enlisted to do just that. Despite itself being a capable and sound airframe, these sort of events were beginning to build a very negative image for the IM. Its civilian-inspired origins, lack of trained combat crews and pilots coupled with the requests of a wartime government all worked in painting a dreary early picture of the Ilya Mourometz line. Combat experience, however, would prove the IM detractors wrong.\n\r\nThe IM quickly became the showcase of the Imperial Russia Air Force bombing offensive. The aircraft proved her worth, capable of delivering respectable bombloads with accuracy across distances against railroad targets and key transportation routes including bridges. The lethality of a single IM element was reportedly capable of rendering enemy positions destroyed for weeks. Imagine what an entire flight of IM systems could bring. The bombsight in these militarized IM's was of particular note at a time where a pilots vision and prowess were utilized moreso than reliance on any sort of bombing assistance devices. Accuracy and resulting successes improved the opinion of IM aircrews to the point that they would sometimes give up their defensive machine gun armament to take on a greater bombload instead.\n\r\nThe IM doubled as an intelligence-gathering platform in the reconnaissance role. Its high-flying, long-distance and well-defended gun positions played up to the IM's strengths.\r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Sikorsky Ilya Mourometz (Series)", "aircraft_type": "Heavy Bomber / Reconnassaince Aircraft"}, {"id": "4b75cad0-d174-45b3-a410-ea7a16356fc0", "year_model": "1909", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Bleriot XI was one of the first notable monoplanes to achieve any level of fame. Primitive by today's standards, the system became a standard all its own in the early 1900s. The type served in a limited capacity during the opening salvos of World War 1 and would achieve fame by crossing the English Channel under the direct control of Bleriot himself. The aircraft will forever be remembered for its stable design and its use of \"wing-warping\" to control roll. At any rate, the Bleriot XI served to cement the legacy of Louis Bleriot in the realm of aviation history.\n\r\nDesign of the Bleriot XI is credited to Louis Bleriot (7/1/1872 - 8/2/1936) and Raymond Saulnier. Saulnier went on to make his own name in the aviation business under the banner of Morane-Saulnier. Bleriot was an engineer by education and credited with the invention of the automobile headlight. Using funds from his successful headlight business venture, he began producing his own working studies of the concept of towed glider flights and began to forge his love of aviation in the process. After a short partnership with Gabriel Voisin (another aircraft engineer whose name preceded some World War 1 fighter design designations all their own), Bleriot took to start his own aviation firm, at first producing the unsuccessful Bleriot V. The Bleriot V became Louis Bleriot's first design to achieve sustained flight.\n\r\nThe VII, complete with its covered-over fuselage, soon followed and proved more in line with front mounted aircraft designs to come. The aircraft was primitive to the core, appearing as something out of a child's imaginary airplane built out of cardboard boxes. The fuselage was a near-perfect rectangular shape while the main wings were low-mounted with noticeable dihedral (upward angle from root to tip). Additional, this design carried a more conventional empennage (tail section) with a single low-fitted vertical tail fin and large area horizontal stabilizers with tailplane elevons. The pilot sat in an open-air cockpit directly behind the engine in the forward fuselage. The engine powered a four-blade paddle-type propeller with broad tapered blades. Power was supplied through a single Antoinette 50-horsepower 8-cylinder water-cooled piston engine. Cruising speed was listed at 50 miles per hour. Bleriot and his VII made a total of six flights before the machine was lost to accident in December of 1907. \n\r\nThe Bleriot IX was an experimental monoplane design fitting an Antoinette engine of 100 horsepower and an off-shoot of the VII but with tandem horizontal tail surfaces. This design succeeded in making a few short \"hops\" about the ground though never achieving sustained flight. The Bleriot X was another of Louis Bleriot's concept attempts and followed more the design path of the American Wright brothers featuring a \"pusher\" type propeller/engine arrangement and biplane wings. Construction of this design was never completed. However, the early attempts (and those all-important subsequent failures) proved to secure the foundation needed to produce the first serviceable monoplane in the Beriot XI, achieving first flight on January 23rd, 1909. The system was showcased at the December 1909 Exposition de la Locomotion Aerienne show in Paris.\n\r\nLouis Bleriot helped to put his creation to the test by completing the first flight across the English Channel. The flight was part of a 1,000 pound prize as put forth through a competition arranged by the London Daily Mail. Matching up against two other would-be winners, Louis Bleriot and his XI took to the skies on July 13th, 1909 and spanned some 36 minutes and 55 seconds, setting the new European endurance record with a distance of 36.6 kilometers from Les Barraques, France to Dover, England. One competitor, Hubert Latham was forced into the sea after developing engine troubles while a test flight for the third entrant, Charles de Lambert, ended in a crash with injuries sustained. Bleriot landed his XI and earn the 1,000 pound prize, though foul weather played a role in the rough landing that caused damage to the propeller and undercarriage. Nevertheless, Bleriot's legacy was sealed as \"The Man Who Crossed the Channel\" for the rest of history.\n\nWalk-Around\n\r\nBy today's standards, the design of the Bleriot XI seems downright archaic. By early 1900s terms, however, the system was one of the first true stable monoplane airframes available to burgeoning pilots. The pilot sat in an open-air cockpit just aft the engine mount, this set to the extreme forward of the fuselage and operating at between 25- and 140-horsepower depending on the powerplant used. The engine powered a simple-though-contoured Chauviere two-blade wooden propeller (a four-blade metal propeller was used in the original design but didn't match up well to the design). \r\n\t\t", "aircraft_name": "Bleriot XI", "aircraft_type": "Trainer / Reconnaissance Monoplane Aircraft"}], "ships": [{"id": "0dea6f59-9fc0-406c-857e-7aab3d68d9bc", "year_model": "2027", "ship_name": "Project 23900 UDC", "ship_type": "Helicopter Carrier / Amphibious Assault Vessel"}, {"id": "b404bda6-91ca-4680-b1b8-c9e0276b033f", "year_model": "2022", "description": "\r\n        \tBelgorod (K-329) is a new Russian Navy nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable submarine belonging to the Project 949A \"Antei\" class (NATO codename of \"Oscar II\".

Onboard stores allow the vessel to stay at-sea for about one month.\n\r\nThe Fregat M2EM serves in the air-search role while the 3Rs-25E Garpun-B, MR-212/201-1, and Nucleus-2 6000A all form the surface-search suite. Fire Control is directed by the JSC-5P-10E \"Puma\", 3R14N-11356, and the MR-90 Orekh SAM systems. Electronic Warfare (EW) involves the TK-25E-5 suite and 4 x KT-216 systems are used to launch decoys.\n\r\nInstalled armament is comprised of a mix of ballistic and missile weapon types. 1 x 100mm A-190 Arsenal turreted main gun is seated over the forecastle. 1 x 8-cell UKSK Vertical Launch System (VLS) can fire both Kalibr and 3M55 Oniks surface-to-surface missiles at range. 2 x 12-cell VLSs are used to house 3S90M Shtil-1 series surface-to-air missiles. Additional anti-aircraft defense is through 8 x Igla-1E missile launchers and 2 x Kashtan Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs). 2 x Twin-tubed 533mm torpedo launchers can counter surface and submarine threats while the latter threat is also addressed by installation of the RBU-6000 Anti-Submarine ROCket (ASROC) launcher unit.\n\r\nAdmiral Makarov maintains an active status in the Russian Fleet as of this writing (2018).\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Makarov (799)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "2a77f7b4-4fb2-4f4d-a7a8-6b0be5c21bb1", "year_model": "2016", "ship_name": "Admiral Essen (751)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "81ae80a6-e277-4320-a45c-118d8052de9a", "year_model": "2016", "ship_name": "Admiral Grigorovich (745)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "d3ce9a12-2f1a-4850-9d19-81783edce872", "year_model": "2014", "ship_name": "Vladimir Monomakh (K-551)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "362bc2a8-ae7b-4331-8bd9-19454c822e9b", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Alexander Nevsky (K-550) is a relatively new ballistic missile submarine commissioned by the Russian Navy as part of a major rearmament and modernization program concerning all of the main Russian service branches. The vessel is nuclear-powered, giving it essentially unlimited range under water, while its armament fit gives it the capability to deliver nuclear payloads. Such power serves as both a deterrence and a defense against foreign meddling and military incursions against the Russian state.\n\r\nThe Nevsky began its construction on March 19th, 2004 by shipbuilder Sevmash of Severodvinsk, Russia. She was launched on December 6th, 2010, conducted her sea trials during 2011 and was formally commissioned on December 23rd, 2013 as the second boat of the advanced Borei-class of ballistic missile submarines. The class represents the Russian Navy's first such vessels to be commissioned since the end of the Cold War (1947-1991). Led by the Yury Dolgorukiy, the group was adopted as a successor to the \"Delta III\" and \"Delta IV\" series boats (detailed elsewhere on this site) as well as the massive \"Typhoon\" line of the Soviet era. A total of eight to ten boats are intended for the class.\n\r\nThe vessel displaces at 14,720 tons (short) when surfaced and 24,000 tons (short) when submerged. Its dimensions include a running length of 557.8 feet, a beam of 44.2 feet, and a draught of 32.9 feet. Her profile is very traditional with a rounded nosecone, forward-set sail, and finned aft section. Along her spine and aft of the sail are the Vertical Launch Systems (VLSs) for her primary nuclear payload while her bow contains conventional torpedo launchers. Propulsion is by way of an OK-650B nuclear reactor along with an AEU steam turbine driving a single shaft. Maximum speeds reach 28 knots making her a very fast submarine while attention has been paid to her construction in regards to helping her run quiet. The typical crew complement is 130 officers and enlisted.\n\r\nIn terms of armament, the primary war load of the Nevsky is 16 x 3M30 \"Bulava\" (NATO: SS-NX-32) Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). These three-stage, solid-fuel/liquid-propellant systems stand some forty feet tall and feature a 6.6 foot diameter, capped by a warhead which can fit up to ten re-entry vehicles each featuring a nuclear yield of 150 kilotons. The submarine also carries a basic torpedo-launching function made up of 21\" (533mm) six tubes and these also support the launching of RPK-2 \"Viyuga\" cruise missiles against land-/ship-based targets.\n\r\nDespite setbacks in the Bulava missile program, the Nevky's commissioning was pushed forward. It is said that the vessel has already completed successful launching of the troublesome missile which is a good step forward for the class as it grows to strength. As of this writing (2015), the Alexander Nevsky maintains an active presence in the Russian Fleet.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Alexander Nevsky (K-550)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "27f79b27-6d2a-40db-83e5-9681dc8926cf", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tThe modern Russian Navy currently (2017) fields five Steregushchiy-class guided-missile corvettes. Some twelve are planned with seven completed and five in active service. Among the group is the Boikiy (532) built by Sevemaya Verf of St. Petersburg. Her keel was laid down on July 27th, 2005 and she was launched to sea on April 15th, 2011. The warship was formally commissioned on May 16th, 2013 and is assigned to the Baltic Sea Fleet.\n\r\nBoikiy displaces 2,100 tons under full load and has a length of 343 feet, a beam of 36 feet and a draught of 12 feet. Her propulsion scheme is a COmbined Diesel And Diesel (CODAD) arrangement allowing either full use, or partial use, of the marine diesels to accomplish full-speed dashing actions or general cruising as an economical measure as needed. Power is through 4 x 16D49 series diesel units developing 24,000 horsepower to 2 x shafts. 4 x Diesel generators (630 kW output) are also installed. This arrangement allows the warship to make headway at 26 knots and range out to 4,000 nautical miles. Endurance with onboard stores and fuel supply is about fifteen days for the crew of 100.\n\r\nThe Boikiy mounts the Furke-E 3D air-search radar and the TK-25E-5 Electronic CounterMeasures (ECM) systems. 4 x PK-10 series launchers serve decoys as needed. Armament is 1 x 100mm A-190 turreted deck gun along with 2 x AK-630M Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs). 2 x 4 330mm torpedo tubes are also carried as are 2 x 14.5mm MTPU heavy machine guns for extreme-close-range actions.\n\r\nAt the heart of the Boikiy's armament suite, however, is the 32-cell missile launcher housing either 9M96E/M or 9M100 Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs). There are also 8 x 3M24 missile launchers featured allowing the warship to tackle just about any incoming ranged threat. To further broaden the vessel's over-the-horizon capabilities is a helipad set over the stern managing a single Kamov Ka-27 Anti-Submarine / Anti-Ship helicopter.\n\r\nThe Boikiy's silhouette is very modern with most of the mass centered on the superstructure. The superstructure is well-contoured to the existing shape of the hull, reducing protrusions that may increase the vessel's signature to prying radar systems. Over the forecastle is the turret housing the main deck gun. The bridge is integrated into the superstructure and offers a commanding view over the forecastle and to port and starboard. The smoke funnel is also integrated and of a low-profile design. The superstructure is stepped down towards the stern helipad deck.\n\r\nBoikiy was one of the Russian warships featured in the April 2017 incident in which several ships passed through the English Channel and were noted by the British Royal Navy. HMS Sutherland was called to escort the ships as they passed through the waters.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Boikiy (532)", "ship_type": "Guide-Missile Corvette / Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "78ccd7fd-c963-4b13-bdb4-49675acf3155", "year_model": "2013", "ship_name": "Severodvinsk / Yasen-class (Project 885/885M)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "8611d06e-ff97-4f1a-a2f6-51258976b4a3", "year_model": "2013", "description": "\r\n        \tFor 2013, the Russian Navy is continuing its programs that will see all-new nuclear-attack submarines, missile-minded frigates, advanced helicopter carriers and fast missile corvettes join the modernization initiative. Decades removed from the disastrous turnover experienced at the end of the Cold War, the Russian military budget is consistently growing in an effort to reassert Mother Russia's will in the Asia-Pacific and central Asian regions. One procurement program has produced fruit to become the Borei-class ballistic missile submarine which has since yielded its first vessel-in-class - the \"Yuri Dolgoruky\" (K-535). The Dolgoruky was laid down on November 2nd, 1996 and officially launched on February 13th, 2008. She was formally commissioned on January 10th, 2013. Construction of the boat was handled by Sevmash in Northwest Russia.\n\r\nOutwardly, the Dolgoruky exhibits a conventionally-arranged exterior with a largely cylindrical hull design capped by a bulbous nose cone, the hull running rearwards in a long grand shape before tapering at the stern. The sail is set ahead of amidships while the tail consists of dorsal and ventral vertical tail fins to serve as the rudder with horizontal planes straddling either side of the rear hull. The propeller extends a short distance away from the tail unit. Dimensionally, the Dolgoruky is a massive machine, measuring 170 meters from bow to stern while showcasing a beam of 13.5 meters with draught of 10 meters and carrying a submerged displacement of 24,000 tons. The boat is crewed by 130 officers and sailors divided into shifts with access to onboard shower, dining and sleeping facilities as standard. Power for the Dolgoruky is primarily served through a single OK-650B series nuclear reactor which provides for essentially unlimited operational ranges and decades of service following proper maintenance routines. The nuclear propulsion system is coupled to an AEU steam turbine and the configuration drives a single shaft at the extreme rear of the vessel. A maximum surface speed of 25 knots is listed with a suggested submerged speed of 32 knots being estimated.\n\r\nOverall, production of the Dolgoruky was slow by modern standards as showcased by its laid-down year of 1996 and its launch date of 2008. Some public issues regarding its hastened construction were revealed before the vessel was brought to sea as various equipment and sensor packages had yet to be added. Regardless, construction eventually completed to the point that sea trials were underway by the end of 2009 as a base crew and engineers ironed various issues out of the design. Delays in the program ensured a formal handover did not occur until 2011. After successfully passing her evaluation period, the Dolgoruky was officially handed over for Russian Navy service by late 2012. Since early 2013, the boat has been undergoing limited operational service that will most likely range throughout the year before large-scale service begins in 2014.\n\r\nKey to the design of the Borei-class submarines is her armament which consists of no fewer than 16 x Bulava Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). The Bulava type missiles are an advanced family of new submarine-launched missiles having entered service only recently in early 2013. These weapons were developed through the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology with production handled by the Votkinsk Plant State Production Association. Each missile measures approximately 40 feet long and weighs in at 40 short tons, powered by a  three-stage solid propellant and liquid-based fuel system providing a range out to 5,000 miles. Each missile yields 150 kilotons of lethality with guidance supplied by an inertial and GPS-based system. Originally, the Borei-class was to be outfitted with the \"R-39M\" series missiles but the project was cancelled after lackluster results. The Dolgoruky also fields 6 x 533mm torpedo tubes for anti-ship/submarine sorties and supports the SS-N-15 \"Blizzard\" cruise missile.\n\r\nThe Borei-class of submarine will eventually number ten in all. The second boat - Aleksandr Nevsky - is expected to join the Dolgoruky with commissioning sometime in late 2013 or, more likely, early 2014. The third boat - Vladimir Monomakh - is expected to be commissioned sometime in 2014. Other sister boats will follow as completed, all expected to have entered operational service by 2020.\n\r\nThe arrival of the Dolgoruky is rather significant to the future plans of the Russian Navy, who now sees a renewed expansion in its capabilities thanks to a greater political (and therefore financial) commitment by Russian authorities. With President Vladimir Putin at the helm for another term, the Russian military expects to further expand the lethal reach of her ocean-going force in the decades to come with some $132 billion dollars already earmarked for various ongoing naval programs.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Yuri Dolgoruky (K-535)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "00c2e90f-0982-4e1f-bde3-c4eecb78ecef", "year_model": "2012", "description": "\r\n        \tINS Chakra (S-71) of the modern Indian Navy is a Russian-made Akula-class nuclear-powered attack submarine at its core. The class was introduced by the Soviets in the mid-1980s and some 21 boats were planned for the series - though only 15 were eventually realized due to the deterioration of the Soviet Empire into the 1990s. Ten remain in active service as of 2016 with Nerpa (K-152) on loan (via lease) to the Indian Navy where it carries the name of \"Chakra\" (named after the weapon of the god Vishnu).\n\r\nThe Russian Navy agreed to lease the boat to the Indian Navy in a 2004 deal. The hand over was delayed by a 2008 incident which left 20 onboard personnel dead (by asphyxiation). The Indian Navy took ownership of the boat on December 30th, 2011 marking the start of a lease period set to span ten years. The crew of Chakra had already been trained in St. Petersburg waters on the nuances of operating and maintaining a nuclear-powered underwater vessel. An official commissioning ceremony for the Chakra was held on April 4th, 2012.\n\r\nThe Chakra follows a Charlie I-class boat of same name, this vessel operating with the Indian Navy from 1988 until 1992. Charlie I boats were also of Soviet-era origin and driven by nuclear technology.\n\r\nAs it stands, Chakra offers the Indian Navy a true nuclear-powered submarine capability it has lacked for some time. The nuclear-based propulsion scheme provides the boat with unlimited undersea staying power as the boat does not need to surface at all to recharge its critical battery stocks. In essence, deployment ranges of the boat are only limited by the endurance of the crew (and their available food supply). The crew of eighty personnel have access to some creature comforts as well and these serve well to aid in long-distance voyages under the sea. The submarine has the capability to reach beyond 30 knots underwater and can submerge as far down as 600 meters. Much emphasis has also been placed on stealth characteristics and this makes Chakra one of the quietest submarines in service.

These represent half of the originally planned number that succeeded the Koni-class of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Gepard-class is led by its first ship, \"Tatarstan\", which was originally ordered as \"Yastreb\". The design is offered for export under several cost-effective configurations.\n\r\nTatarstan saw her keel laid down in 1991 and she was launched to sea during July 1993. Her work was suspended during the mid-1990s when the Russian Navy budget was severed but she was eventually fitted out, completed, and launched again on August 31th, 2003 to which she was then assigned as flagship of the Caspian Flotilla where she remains an active participant in Russian patrols there.\n\r\nAs completed, Tatarstan was given a displacement of 1,500 tons under standard load and nearly 2,000 tons under full load. Her measurements include an overall length of 335 feet, a beam of 42.9 feet and a draught down to 17 feet. Power is from a CODOG (COmbined Diesel Or Gas) arrangement allowing some customizability by the crew in choosing what power configuration to use during certain actions (cruising / dashing etc...). Maximum speed in ideal conditions is 28 knots and operational ranges are out to 4,000 nautical miles (when cruising at 10 knots).\n\r\nThe Tatarstan features a crew complement of 98 men and holds enough supplies and food for up to fifteen days at sea, forcing the vessel to remain somewhat close to allied ports. Its hull is designed for deep water service, able to withstand Sea States up to Level 5 (up to 13 feet waves) but she is a naturally lightweight design. Onboard systems include hull-mounted and towable sonar systems, fire control radars and the Cross Dome air search radar system. A full-service helicopter hangar and deck support rotary-win operations at sea, giving a vital over-the-horizon ability as well as an active submarine-hunting capability.\n\r\nArmament is key to the survival of the guided-missile frigate. Tatarstan is appropriately equipped with 2 x quadruple missile launchers supporting the Kh-35 Anti-Ship (AS) series missiles and 1 x Osa-M twin launcher Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system to protect against incoming aerial threats. Conventional armament includes 1 x 76.2mm Ak-176 turreted deck gun along the bow and 2 x 30mm AK-630 Close-In-Weapon Systems (CIWSs). She also carries 4 x 533mm torpedo tubes as well as 1 x RBU-6000 Anti-Submarine ROCket (ASROC) launcher. In this way, Tatarstan is fully-equipped to engage all manner of modern battlefield threats - whether they lie above the water, on it or under.\n\r\nThe Gepard-class is also marketed by Russia for interested export parties across five distinct configurations: \"Gepard-1\" loses its Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) functionality as well as its helicopter hangar while \"Gepard-2\" brings along the latter but does not feature the VDS fit or the SA-N-4 missile fit. \"Gepard-3\" is completed with a heavier displacement as well as enlarged beam measurement and installs the \"Kortik\" Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) over the standard AK-630 CIWS units. The \"Gepard-4\" loses its weapon installations altogether for featuring a more dedicated Search-and-Rescue (SAR) role. \"Gepard-5\" does not have a helicopter hangar but increased operational range through use of diesel units (8,000 horsepower each) though at the expense of straight line speed (reduced to 23 knots).\n\r\nVietnam is the only foreign operator of the Gepard-class. The Russian Navy is set to feature three total units before the end - Albatros (commissioned on November 28th, 2012) and Burevestnik (to be added). Vietnam operates the ship type as the HQ-011 \"Dinh Tien Hoang\" and the HQ-012 \"Ly Thai To\". Two more ships have yet to be named and remain under construction as of October 2015.\n\r\nTatarstan is named after the Republic of Tatarstan in the Volga Federal District of Russia.\n\r\nThe Gepard-class went to action against ISIS/ISIL forces in October 2015 when the Caspian Flotilla launched cruise missiles some 1,500 kilometers away from Syria. These missiles passed through parts of Iran and Iraq to reach their targets. Russia is aligned with Iran, Iraq and Syria in their involvement against ISIS/ISIL.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Tatarstan (Yastreb) (Project 1161)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "76016208-fa59-4a76-8fb7-7b17dbfaa709", "year_model": "1999", "description": "\r\n        \tTo match the American Navy's Arleigh Burke-class multi-mission, guided missile destroyers, Soviet engineers were asked to develop a modernized solution through the existing Udaloy-class ships of fighting ships in 1982. The work spawned the related \"Udaloy II\" class which essentially morphed the anti-submarine-minded group into an anti-ship destroyer platform.  The upgraded class was given an all-new anti-ship missile suite as well as improved local defense capabilities and Fire Control System (FCS).\n\r\nThe product of the class became Admiral Chabanenko (DD-650) while two other vessels were also planned to join her. However, the fall of the Soviet Empire heavily curtailed expansion of the program and resulted in just Chabanenko being completed. The vessel saw its keel laid down on February28th, 1989 and was launched on June 16th, 1994 before seeing formal commissioning on January 28th, 1999. Despite her Cold War roots, she continues in service with the Russian Northern Fleet today (2014).\n\r\nHer planned sisters - Admiral Basisty and Admiral Kucherov - were both laid down in 1991 but never completed and ultimately scrapped in 1994 and 1993 respectively, leaving the Udaloy II-class strength at just one.\n\r\nA key change to the Udaloy-class design to produce the Udaloy II-class was the introduction of the newer \"Zvezda\" M-2 series sonar system. The original pair of 100mm decks guns was replaced by  a twin-gunned 130mm AK-130 installation at the forecastle to provide improved medium-ranged defense against inbound surface threats. The RBU-Udav anti-torpedo suite (twin launchers) increased the ship's standard survivability in the face of emerging submarine threat capabilities from the West and the original anti-submarine SS-N-14 \"Silex\" anti-submarine missiles were given up in favor of the SS-N-22 \"Sunburn\" missile for engaging surface threats at range. Torpedo launch tubes were held near amidships. Aerial threats were countered through an 8 x 8 bank of SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\" surface-to-air missiles in a Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrangement. Close-in defense was aided through 4 x 6 30mm AK630 Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWSs) Gatling-style cannon suitable for engaging incoming aerial threats including cruise missiles.\n\r\nPower for the vessel came through a conventional gas turbine arrangement - this carried over from the original class and essentially made up of 4 x gas turbines in a COmbined Gas and Gas (COGAG) arrangement feeding 2 x shafts at 120,000 horsepower. COGAG mated two gas turbines to a single shaft, allowing a gearbox to arrange drive power from either one or both of the turbines depending on the amount of power required. In this way, the vessel could utilize either two or all four of its turbines at any one time to accomplish general cruising or short, speedy dashes. Maximum speed in ideal conditions could therefore reach 35 knots with a service range out to 10,500 nautical miles (12,100 miles). \n\r\nThe profile of the Admiral Chabanenko became typical of the Udaloy class with an uneven superstructure design showcasing relatively low profile mast works. The forecastle was home the turreted 130mm deck gun and two banks of two cylindrical, horizontally-mounted launchers identified just ahead of the bridge superstructure. Between the launchers was the Vertical Launch System (VLS). The bridge itself was identified y its large rectangular windows along the front and sides of its design. The various masts contain the equally various communications and sensor arrays required for optimal ship service over vast ocean spaces. At amidships were the two paired mounts of low-profile smoke funnels. A full-service helicopter deck and hangar was added over the stern and supported up to 2 x Kamov naval helicopters in the ASW, Search and Rescue (SAR), or transport roles. The standard operation crew of the vessel was listed at around 300 personnel. Dimensions included a length of 163 meters, a beam of 19.3 meters, and a draught of 6.2 meters. Displacement values reached 6,930 tons under standard load and 7,570 tons under full load.\n\r\nThus far the only notable action pertaining to the Admiral Chabanenko was its passing of the Panama Canal during 2008, marking the first time that a Russian Fleet warship had passed that part of the globe since the fighting of World War 2 (1939-1945).\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Chabanenko (DD-650)", "ship_type": "Guided Missile Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "a0a8768a-f243-4602-9cfb-413ec0e9a99b", "year_model": "1998", "description": "\r\n        \tThe battlecruiser warship rose to prominence in the early part of the 20th Century, modeled after \"all-big-gun\" battleships while carrying less armor for the purpose of attaining faster cruising speeds.

Even into the 1980s, some world powers continued to support the concept of the battlecruiser (though no longer cannon-armed warships) including the Soviet Union which maintained a health stable of surface warships to work alongside their powerful undersea force.\n\r\nThe battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy was one such addition, laid down in 1986 and launched a full decade later in 1996.

While America built up her military forces, the Communist Soviet Union could not keep pace and, in 1991, finally collapsed, leaving the United States as the lone super power of the world.  Huge amounts of Russian military hardware were mothballed and more than 100 submarines and warships - including search and rescue equipment - were decommissioned and left to rot in the harbors of the Kola Peninsula, home of the Russian Northern Fleet.  Some frontline equipment was retained and maintained along with the soldiers and sailors needed for respective their operation but the majority of Russian military men were out of work and not being paid. As such, many went home and did what they could to feed themselves and their families. \n\r\nDespite all this loss of power within the Russian government, the military somehow found a billion rubles for \"Project 949A Antey\" and constructed the K-141 \"Kursk\" - the largest attack submarine in the world. She would become one of the most important and highly feared anti-ship weapons ever developed. \n\r\nThe Kursk was built at the Severodvinsk docks and launched and commissioned in 1994.  The hull was 30-feet longer than the previous Oscar I-class submarines, being some 505-feet in length. She had advanced electronics and was more maneuverable than the Oscar I boats while still being even quieter - surprise was the ultimate goal of a hunter-killer. She was twice as long as a passenger Jumbo Jet - so long, in fact, that additional room allowed all the senior officers to have their own individual state rooms.  She was so large that upgraded extras never seen on American boats were added such as a sauna, solarium, swimming pool. It didn't stop there - also included were an aquarium and an aviary.  The Russian navy felt the additions were a good idea for crew morale due to the low rates of pay and extensive time spent away at sea.\n\r\nKursk was built with a 2-inch \"double hull\" which comprised of an inner pressure hull and an outer hydrodynamic hull - the latter made of a concentrated content of nickel and chrome stainless steel some 8.5mm thick.  The distance between the hulls provided additional buoyancy and for the crews mental welfare, the designers indicated the hull design improved their survivability against American torpedoes. The outer hull had a minute magnetic signature that helped avoid detection by American submarines through Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) systems.  The inner hull was divided into nine watertight compartments making her, some thought, unsinkable. To break through the Arctic ice the large sail superstructure was reinforced. Onboard, she could hold enough supplies to stay submerged for 120 days at a time.  Her weapons were formidable with 24 x P-700 Granit supersonic cruise missiles (each having a range of 550km) and the massive 650mm 65K torpedo tubes capable of launching both torpedoes and anti-ship missiles. The Kursk also had 4 x 533mm torpedo tubes for SS-N-16 Stallion anti-ship missiles, these having a range of 50 km.\n\r\nHer powerplant consisted of 2 x OK-650b pressurized water nuclear reactors delivering 120,700 shaft horsepower, in turn, powering 2 x steam turbines with these delivering 49,600 horsepower each to 2 x shafts, these fitted with 2 x 7-bladed propellers. The large boat was slow when diving and unhurried to maneuver, but they had a submerged speed of about 30 knots which proved sufficient in keeping pace with the American carrier task forces.\n\r\nEven in the mid-1990's, the Northern Fleet sailors had still gone unpaid but the situation changed by 1999. The Kursk carried out a reconnaissance mission in the Mediterranean, shadowing the US Navy's Sixth Fleet during the Kosovo War.  In August of 2000, the Russian Navy held a fleet exercise in the Bering Sea with more than thirty warships and three nuclear submarines in play. To monitor the exercise, the American Navy sent two submarines - the USS Memphis and the USS Toledo - along with a number of surface ships while Norwegian and US aircraft were overhead on watch.   Like the \"Belle of the Ball\" coming late to the party, the pride of the Russian Fleet - the Kursk - joined the exercise on the 10th and the training began with a massive firing of surface ship weapons of all kinds.  While submerged, the Kursk successfully launched her most advanced cruise missile - the Granit - with a dummy warhead.  \n\r\nOn August 12th she was ordered to pull back from the main fleet so she could test fire one of her largest 650mm torpedoes (again using a dummy warhead) at the Pyotr Velikiy, a decommissioned Kirov-class battlecruiser.  Fleet Admiral Popoff,  from his flagship Peter the Great, a heavy missile cruiser, radioed to the Kursk at 9am to fire the torpedo and Kursk acknowledged the signal - this would be the last anyone would hear from the submarine. Something, it seemed, had gone terribly wrong and no one had heard from her for two days despite her orders to maintain radio contact.  The day she went silent, at 11:28am, the USS Memphis, charged with monitoring the fleet, had picked up two underwater explosions.\n\r\nThe Russians launched a rescue mini sub but due to previous Russian Navy cutbacks, the vessel was old and few knew how to operate it. As such, the mission to reconnoiter the Kursk subsequently failed.  On August 16th Russian divers found the Kursk lying on the bottom of the Barents Sea in 350 feet of water not far from the Russian military complex at Murmansk.  The divers said they heard faint knocking but were unable to open the outer or inner hatch because of a lack of proper tools and necessary experience. The men of the Kursk, it seemed, were doomed. \n\r\nIn true Soviet fashion, the Russian military had put a blackout on the disaster but news leaked out to the Russian public, resulting in their people crowding churches to pray for the men to be safely recovered.  The Russian government refused offers of help from the British and Norwegian governments and, after a week, all hope for a rescue was lost.  Finally, relenting due to pressures from Kursk families, the British and Norwegian divers were allowed to try to gain entrance to the submarine.  The drivers worked for 7 hours and opened the hatches, finding the inner spaces flooded. They then examined the Kursk from bow to stern, finding the double hull ripped open with a hole more than 200 feet long. It now became evident that the crew and observers onboard had either drowned or suffocated within a few hours of the accident.\n\r\nGrief-stricken family members demanded an explanation and the Russian Navy felt one of the American submarines following the Kursk had collided with her, causing the sinking.  The American Navy rebuked the charges but the Russian Navy insisted in trying to keep blame from their underfunded military complex.  The collision was put to rest when the British Blacknest Institute proved that, at the time of the loss of the Russian submarine, two underwater explosions were, in fact, recorded.  The Russian military insisted the noise was from a collision with an American submarine but Blacknest provided data showing a collision supplied a different sound than that of an underwater explosion. The two explosion events were recorded 135 seconds apart - the first registered 2.2 and the second 4.4 on the Richter scale.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Kursk (K-141)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "d7b7067a-71fe-4444-ad29-5eec09e5ff13", "year_model": "1993", "ship_name": "Neustrashimyy (class) / (Project 11540 Yastreb)", "ship_type": "Multi-role Frigate Warship"}, {"id": "fe350cf2-1545-4d41-8dd6-c704b90f45e5", "year_model": "1992", "ship_name": "Admiral Panteleyev (548)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Destroyer"}, {"id": "cdc623f9-b7a5-4959-8825-946b27879a17", "year_model": "1991", "description": "\r\n        \tDue to historical and political considerations carrier development got off to a slow start in the Soviet Union.  The debate over large decked carriers has been ongoing for decades starting the 1930's with Stalin; however two carriers were planned but cancelled with the start of WW II with the ground war being the major consideration.  After the war the Soviet Navy saw how the aircraft carrier played a pivotal role in defeating Japan. In 1945 the Soviets drafted plans to construct a new class of carriers by the 1950's. With Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev took over the Soviet state and announced deep military cuts.   The plans to construct a new class of carriers were stopped by Khrushchev feeling that a nuclear strike would eliminate a carrier as a viable weapon so the carrier program became a prime target for cancellation. \n\r\n In the early 1960's when the Brezhnev regime took over, the carrier became a reality with the Moskva and the Leningrad built between 1965 and 1968.  However they were not true aircraft carriers supported only with helicopters, no fixed wing aircraft.  This concept was one of antisubmarine vessels used as a weapon suite that protected against the American nuclear submarine threat.  Again the compromise between the anti sub and fleet protection was the Kiev CVHG class in 1975, both were helicopter vessels.  Arguments between the government and the military continued but the day of the true Soviet aircraft carrier was at hand in 1991 with the Kuznetsov CV class aircraft carrier.\n\r\nAdmiral Kuznetsov was first named \"Riga\" for the city of then \"Leonid Brezhnev\", next was \"Tbilisi\" also a Russian city. Her classification was changed from \"CV\", aircraft carrier, to \"TAVKR\", or heavy aircraft carrying cruiser.  The reason for the name change was the Montreaux Convention in 1936 stated an aircraft carrier CV could not pass through the Dardanelles.   Russia's carriers are built on the Black Sea making this an international issue when the time came for the ships to enter the Mediterranean Sea and beyond.  \n\r\nCurrently Admiral Kuznetsov is the only Russian fixed wing carrier in service.  She is conventionally powered and has a mixture of fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. The carrier's main fixed-wing aircraft is the multirole Su-33. The air groups can perform air superiority, fleet defense, and air support missions.  Also on board are twin seats Su-27, which are used for pilot training along with the Su-25UTG. The carrier also carries the Kamov Ka-27 and Ka-31 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare and troop transport.\n\r\nFixed wing aircraft taking off from the Admiral utilize a ski-jump on the front of the flight deck. Aircraft accelerate up the ski-jump using their afterburners. This results in the  aircraft leaving the flight deck at a modestly higher angle and elevation than on an comparable American aircraft carrier with their flat deck and steam catapults. The ski-jump creates less G-force on the pilot because the acceleration is lower.  The result is a takeoff speed of only 120-140 km/h requiring an aircraft engine that will not stall at low speeds.\n\r\nThe Russian Navy has indicated they will continue to be committed to aircraft carrier development based on the US Navy model.  This is easy to say however it will require massive funds, technology and additional trained naval personnel currently not available.  Also the Khrushchev mind set has not completely gone away with the cost of the USN model and anti-ship missiles making a carrier an easy target in a conflict.  Another issue is the additional cost of the carrier fleet to protect the carrier.   Some in Moscow feel this is not a good argument due to Russian ships having a weapons suite of SSM/SAM missiles on board for air threat protection.  The expansion of a Russian carrier fleet is bleak at best. However the desire to provide political forward presence like the visit to Venezuela on 11/25/08 and Cuba in early 2009 is a top priority.  The future of the Kuznetsov is problematic with parts becoming an issue and refits scheduled closer together.  The Russian government feels she will be in service till 2030, being the only carrier supporting fixed wing aircraft.  Another problem for the military will be to maintain her aged aircraft.    \n\r\nHer sister ship, Varyag was launched in 1988 but never completed.  Some reports indicate is she is to be sold to the Peoples Republic of China another report says she will become a floating hotel.  She is reported to be moored at the Nikolayev South shipyard in Ukraine.   Navy officials indicated due to her material condition she will never go to sea.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Kuznetsov (CV Project 1143-5/6)", "ship_type": "Conventionally-Powered Aircraft Carrier"}, {"id": "6c0d3de7-b48c-48f3-a68e-c88732728393", "year_model": "1989", "ship_name": "Varyag (011)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Cruiser Warship"}, {"id": "14ee239a-762f-4fd4-a568-cb2f94124e52", "year_model": "1988", "ship_name": "Admiral Levchenko (605)", "ship_type": "Guided Missile Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "8fd96734-a8c5-4baa-bf67-aa461c80ee77", "year_model": "1988", "description": "\r\n        \tThe battlecruiser remained a vital component for the Soviet Navy well into the end-years of the Soviet Empire. The Kirov-class was designed as a nuclear-powered surface combatant with a mainly missile-minded armament suite and four of the five planned vessels were ultimately completed. After the fall of the Soviet Empire, the ships were given all-new names but eventually decommissioned from active service save for one. The lone survivor today (2017) remains \"Admiral Nakhimov\", known originally as the \"Kalinin\" when she was originally launched in 1986.\n\r\nThe building program for the Kirov-class was launched in December of 1977 and this initiative became one of the largest post-World War 2 programs involving surface warships aside from aircraft carriers. While categorized as battlecruisers, and intended as dedicated submarine-hunters from the outset, they were essentially evolved to become guided-missile cruisers before the end and were known as \"missile cruisers\" to the Soviets - able to tackle several important roles at sea including Task Group Command for the carrier fleet.\n\r\nKalinin / Admiral Nakhimov saw its keel laid down on May 17th, 1983 at the Baltiysky Naval Shipyard of Leningrad. Launched on April 25th, 1986, the warship was formally commissioned on December 30th, 1988 for active service in the Soviet fleet, carrying pennant number \"180\" and then - in 1989 - \"064\". In 1990, her pennant identifier was revised (yet again) to become \"085\" and then, in 1994, this became \"080\".\n\r\nAs completed, Kalinin displaced 24,300 tons under standard load and 28,000 tons under full load. Her length measured 827 feet with a beam of 94 feet and a draught of 30 feet. Unlike conventionally-powered surface warships of the West, the Kirov-class were developed to used a hybrid propulsion arrangement involving a twin-nuclear system coupled to steam turbines for propulsion. Kalinin carried a nuclear fit (tied to oil-fired boilers) to generate steam that fed the turbines and these, in turn, developed 140,000 horsepower driving two shafts under stern. The vessel could make headway (rather impressively for its size) at 32 knots and range out to 1,000 nautical miles while cruising at 30 knots. Her true range was essentially indefinite due the reactor fit, primarily limited by onboard oil stores, crew fatigue, and food stores.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Nakhimov (Kalinin)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Battlecruiser / Guided Missile Cruiser Warship"}, {"id": "acb36d0b-1abf-4623-bafd-227ee5f03685", "year_model": "1988", "description": "\r\n        \tThe amphibious assault has proven to be one of the most dangerous, yet ultra-critical, components of warfare since ancient times. As such, it falls onto naval forces to supply the fighting men and machines with the means to cross over from water to land in an attempt to carry the fight to the enemy. Various naval powers of the world have invested mightily in the technologies that enable such doctrine to exist and the Soviet Navy contracted for the massive \"Zubr-class\" LCAC (\"Landing Craft Air Cushion\") before the fall of the Soviet Empire (1922-1991). The first vessel in the class was commissioned in 1988, representing the largest air-cushioned vehicles in the world. In the post-Cold War world, their service now falls under the Russian Navy flag as well as several other powers of the world.\n\r\nThe Zubr-class is identified by NATO as the \"Pomornik\" and is also known by the Soviet/Russian Navy designation of \"Project 1232.2\".\n\r\nThe Zubr craft is given a length of 187 feet with a beam measuring 84 feet and a draught of 5.2 feet. It displaces at 415 tons when under normal load and reaches 555 tons when under full load. Her profile includes a bridge superstructure at amidships with three large, shrouded propulsion fans aft. The forward section of the boat is largely unobstructed and sports a raised bow with a lowering ramp for embarking/disembarking units, systems, cargo and infantry. The hull - specially-designed to mitigate the effects of magnetic naval mines - sits atop an inflatable bed which provides the necessary cushion when going ashore. The cushion is deflated to bring the bow ramp to ground level. The Zubr craft features a surface search radar, chaff launcher and decoys among other integrated systems. Armament (largely self-defensive in nature) includes Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) launchers, 2 x 30mm AK-630 cannons and 2 x rocket launchers. The vessel can also dispense naval or anti-personnel mines as required.\n\r\nInternally, the Zubr features a centralized hold for carrying vehicles or cargo. Living spaces for the four officers, 31 enlisted personnel and combat-ready infantry are afforded while being fully protected by an NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) system in the event of nuclear war. Some creature comforts are also added including eating areas, heating and cooling to allow the Zubr to operate in most any climate setting. The vessel's hold can house up to three Main Battle Tank (MBT) type vehicles, up to eight Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) or similar, ten general military vehicles or up to 500 infantry. Of course the craft can also replace these items with pure cargo, taking advantage of its 4,300 square foot hold.\n\r\nThe Zubr relies on a combination of 5 x Kuznetsov NK-12MV series, gasoline-fueled turboprop engines, two used for generating the necessary lift and three utilized in propelling the vessel. All told, these installations generate up to 11,836 horsepower. The three propulsion engines manage four variable-pitch propeller assemblies. The Zubr can make up to 40 knots in ideal conditions and reach speeds up to 60 knots under certain conditions. Operational range is listed out to 300 miles. The hull is designed for operations in up to \"Sea State 4\", which identifies wave heights of four feet to eight feet.\n\r\nTo date (2014), only nine examples of the Zubr have appeared. Two are in service with the Russian Navy (770 Evgeny Kocheshkov and 782 Mordovia) while two have been acquired by the Ukrainian Navy (U420 and U424). The Greek (Hellenic) Navy  has taken on service of four vessels and originated from both Russia and Ukraine. These are named in addition to their hull numbers - HS Kefalonia (L180), HS Ithaki (L181), HS Kerkyra (L182) and HS Zakynthos (L183). The Chinese Navy is believed to have contracted for four of the large amphibious vessels with two of them to be built in Chinese shipyards.

The type was based on the Kiev-class of aircraft carriers led by the Kiev itself and joined by sister ships Minsk and Novorossiysk. Towards the end of the Cold War and after the Soviet Empire's final collapse in 1991, the Soviet fleet fell on hard times and all four vessels were sold off. The Kiev and Minsk were sold to China while the Novorossiysk became scrap. The Baku - renamed to the \"Admiral Gorshkov\" late in its career - was sold to the Indian Navy and is set for recommissioning sometime in 2012 as the refitted \"Vikramaditya\". \n\r\nThe Baku had her keel laid down at Ukrainian Shipyard No.444 in 1978 to which construction proceeded for several years thereafter. In 1982, the vessel was launched and underwent sea trials, ending with her formal commissioning in 1987 as the \"Baku\", this after the city of Baku in Azerbaijan. The Baku carried the Baku name from 1987 until 1991 (then under the Soviet Navy flag) to which the vessel was renamed the \"Admiral Gorshkov\" for the remainder of her Russian career (after the fall of the Soviet Union). her career closed in 1995 prior to her refit and subsequent sale to India. The Admiral Gorshkov name was derived from the Soviet Cold War-era navy admiral of the same name - Admiral Sergey Gorshkov.\n\r\nDesign of the Baku/Admiral Gorshkov was a mixed breed of conventional aircraft carrier standards and armed heavy cruiser. The flight deck consisted of a short stern-to-portside runway designed for short take-off and recovery. The bow section was where most of the defensive and offensive weaponry was held - torpedo tubes and deck guns clearly visible. The island superstructure was offset to the starboard side and towered over the featureless flight deck immediately to the left. Beyond that, the type was well-formed with clean lines designed to cut through the roughest of northern hemisphere seas.\n\r\nThe Admiral Gorshkov managed an air wing of 12 x Yakovlev Yak-38 Forger VTOL aircraft (Vertical Take-Off and Landing). The Yak-38 was roughly the equivalent of the British BAe Sea Harrier though limited in its tactical scope and operational range (only 231 were produced before retirement in 1991). The fixed-wing aircraft was supplemented by up to 16 x Kamov navalized helicopters for anti-ship, anti-submarine and general reconnaissance sorties.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Gorshkov (Baku CVHG-103)", "ship_type": "Aircraft Carrier / Heavy Cruiser Warship"}, {"id": "8dd76e3d-8b9c-439e-aad1-f1c5f8263572", "year_model": "1987", "ship_name": "Primorsky Komsomolets (354)", "ship_type": "Anti-Submarine Corvette Warship"}, {"id": "ffa05c39-1645-4902-a1f8-f9be1b377096", "year_model": "1987", "description": "\r\n        \tDuring the Cold War decades, the Soviet Navy was forced to keep pace with developments in the West, particularly with the growing capabilities of American submarines.

The original plan involved a fleet of fifteen such ships but this ended with thirteen vessels completed as two were ultimately cancelled. The Soviet Union was no more in 1991 and the ships were grandfathered into the new Russian Navy.

Though serving in her intended role for years, she was later renamed as the Admiral Lazarev after 1992. Though traditionally classified as a missile cruiser, the Frunze and her Kirov-class ships are also known as battlecruisers because of the long range and firepower they possess. Next to aircraft carriers, the Frunze and her associated class of warships represent some of the largest sea-going vessels on the water today.\n\r\nThe Frunze is powered by twin nuclear reactors of KN-3 PWR type which work in conjunction with twin steam boilers which in turn feed two shafts. A top speed of over 30 knots can be attained and the nuclear reactors provide for an essentially unlimited range making her a prime adversary of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the West.

Her superstructure takes up most of her midship and stern area while the bow contains the large amount of missile firing ports needed for the bulk of her long-range arsenal. Accommodations for personnel on board total over 700 sailors, officers and a small contingent of airmen. Her air arm is represented by three Kamov-brand Ka-27 \"Helix\" or Ka'25 \"Hormone\" type anti-ship / anti-submarine helicopters which are stored in hangars below deck. Onboard systems afforded to the Frunze include sonar, fire control, navigation and search radars.\n\r\nAs of this writing, the Admiral Lazarev (formerly Frunze) was waiting to be re-commissioned after having spent some time in limbo. This, of course, is directly related to budgetary constraints faced by Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In any case, it is foreseeable that the Admiral Lazarev will see active service in the resurgent Russian military movement. Her primary region of operation is the Pacific Ocean.\n\r\nAdmiral Lazarev has been out of service since 1999. She remains laid up at Abrek bay.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Lazarev (Frunze)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Guided-Missile Cruiser / Battlecruiser Warship"}, {"id": "5882e6a5-cf67-4a5a-951a-9587222aefb4", "year_model": "1984", "ship_name": "Akula (K-284)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine"}, {"id": "ad33df7b-08c6-4da8-a9f6-ff8f0d98f8a0", "year_model": "1983", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Slava-class (Project 1164 Atlant) was a Soviet Cold War-era initiative intended to field some 10 guided missile cruisers for the Soviet Navy during the 1970s. Design work began in the 1960s and the types were scheduled to be outfitted with conventional propulsion, an array of sensors and processing systems and a plethora of missile armament to contend with the threat posed by Western aircraft and waterborne threats against Soviet territory and interests. In the end, only three of the planned vessels were ever completed due to the end of the Soviet Empire in 1991, leaving one incomplete hulk and six vessels to cancellation. The Moskva - originally commissioned as the Slava (meaning \"Glory\") - became the lead ship of the class and her keel was laid down in 1976 by 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant. She was launched in 1979 and officially commissioned for Soviet Navy service on January 30th, 1983. Her name was changed in 1995 to honor the Russian capital city of Moscow and her primary station is as part of the Black Sea Fleet. \"Project 1164 Atlant\" is the Soviet Navy designation for the Slava-class.\n\r\nThe Moskva missile cruiser exhibits a wholly conventional design profile made up by an upward-sloping bow, centralized superstructure and stern helicopter landing deck. The Moskva features a singular deck gun along the forecastle, large missile launchers along the port and starboard sides and an enclosed forward mast containing radar, communications and sensitive processing systems. The bridge is fitted high atop the superstructure for a commanding view of the field ahead. An aft superstructure contains the aft mast and a pair of low-profile, enclosed smoke funnels. A small helicopter landing deck can manage a single twin-rotor Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 navalized helicopter or similar - anti-submarine warfare helicopters designed to specifically search, track and engage enemy submarines. The full crew complement consists of 480 personnel including the small air detachment. The vessel displaces at 11,500 tons and armor consists of splinter plating protection.\n\r\nThe Moskva is a conventionally-powered \"blue water\" vessel designed for operations far from shore, either independent or as part of the main Russian fleet. Propulsion is provided for by 4 x gas turbines arranged in a COGOG (COmbined Gas Or Gas) configuration developed for ultimate efficiency. COGOG allows for both low and high engine output for both general cruising and high-speed darting respectively.  The configuration allows for better management of limited fuel stores and more flexibility in travel modes over older engine arrangements. A clutch system manages each turbines and total output produced is approximately 121,000 shaft horsepower delivering to 2 x shafts. Range is listed at 10,000 miles when maintaining a cruising speed of 16 knots.\n\r\nThe Moskva is outfitted with an array of sensors and processing systems led by its powerful Voskhod/Top Pair MR-800 series 3D long-range search radar providing a modern \"all-seeing\" digital suite. This is coupled with a Fregat MR-710 3D air search radar to counter incoming aerial threats. Navigation is assisted by the \"Palm Frond\" suite and fire control consists of several radar installations and applicable systems - the Bass Tilt AK-360 series handling short-ranged aerial threats (including cruise missiles), the MPZ-301 Baza SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) control, the Door-C SSM (Surface-to-Surface Missile) control, the MG-332 Tigan-2T sonar array integrated into the bow and a Platina \"Horse Tail\" MF VDS (Variable Depth Sonar) fitted aft. Intercept and jamming antennas (the \"Kol'cho\" suite) help manage the onboard electronic warfare suite and 2 x 140mm PK-2 DL series chaff-flare dispensers are fitted to thwart incoming radar and missile threats.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Moskva (Project 1164 Atlant)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Cruiser Warship"}, {"id": "aca15a7c-0086-486a-b33a-05b2bb905278", "year_model": "1982", "description": "\r\n        \tThe Kilo-class submarine was laid down by the Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering and officially commissioned in April of 1982. 57 total vessels of the class were ultimately completed and 47 remain in active service as of this writing (September 2013). Two have been formally retired from service while a single boat was lost. The Kilo-class replaced the outgoing Tango-class boats while the Kilo-class itself was succeeded by the Lasa-class series. The boats have been exported beyond Soviet/Russian territories and have served with Algeria, China, India, Iran, Poland, Romania and Vietnam. The class is designed primarily for anti-ship/anti-submarine duties.\n\r\nDesign-wise, the Kilo-class displaces at 2,300 tons when surfaced and nearly 4,000 tons when submerged. She features a running length of up to 74 meters with a beam measuring 9.9 meters and a draught of 6.5 meters. The vessel has been tested to depths of 300 meters while oeprational service is typically at 240 meters. The Kilo-class is outfitted with a conventional powerplant arranged as a diesel-electric configuration. This includes 2 x diesel generators outputting 1,000kW of power and tied to 1 x motor delivering up to 6,800 shaft horsepower to a single, multi-bladed, fixed-pitch propeller held along a shaft at the stern. This arrangement allows the vessel a to surfaced speed of 12 knots with a submerged speed nearing 25 knots. Operational range is approximately 7,500 miles when cruising at seven knots along the surface. Range is reduced when submerged to 400 miles heading at 3 knots. The Kilo-class holds enough stores to supply a crew up to 45 days at sea before replenishment is required. Her crew consists of 52 personnel made up of officers and sailors.\n\r\nAs an attack submarine, the craft is outfitted with 6 x 533mm torpedo tubes with 18 x torpedo reloads. Some versions are outfitted further with the Club S anti-ship missile system. The craft can also disperse up to 24 naval mines if required (in place of the torpedo load). Russian variants are defensed on the surface through 8 x SA-N-8 \"Gremlin\" or 8 x SA-N-10 \"Gimlet\" surface-to-air missile systems. \n\r\nThe modern Russian Navy is believed to operate some 17 Kilo submarines today (2013). China, India and Vietnam represent the next largest operators with 12, 10 and 6 respectively.

The Soviet Union rose to prominence in World War 2, particularly after the German invasion of the country through Operation Barbarossa. While the German Army came within earshot of the Soviet capital of Moscow, the Soviets managed to turn back the tide of the German onslaught through good luck and a massive outpouring of man, machine and patriotism. The Soviet Union went on to claim much of Germany's east interests and eventually captured Berlin proper, only to find a dead Adolf Hitler await them. Regardless, the war prompted the Soviet the Union to become an undisputed superpower in the modern world and a \"cold\" war ensued - primarily between the United States and Russia - in areas of the world that would become their battlefield (Korea in the 1950s, Vietnam from the 1950s into the 1970s). \n\r\nRumors were soon prevalent in the Pentagon that a new weapon was being built behind the \"Iron Curtain\" - a supposedly giant and undetectable nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (essentially real-world story behind the Tom Clancy suspense novel, \"The Hunt for Red October\"). The vessel was laid down on June 30th, 1976 and, in 1981, the lead boat of the \"Akula\", or \"Shark\" class, was completed at the Severodvinsk Shipyard on the White Sea near Archangel and commissioned on December 29th, 1981 as the \"TK-108\" (a total of six submarines in the class would be completed).  Leonid Brezhnev is said to have used the word \"Typhoon\" to describe a new submarine so NATO aptly used this as its reporting name. When the Soviets allowed the submarine to be seen in public for the first time, she quickly became a feared weapon of the Cold War to the pro-western navies of the world. Later, TK-189 was renamed the \"Dmitri Donskoi\" after the Grand Duke of Moscow of 1359.\n\r\nThe Akula-class became the largest submarine ever built up to that point. She was quieter than any previous Russian submarine design attempt due to new \"quiet\" techniques developed specifically for the Typhoon boats. Additionally, she was more maneuverable than the preceding Russian Delta-class submarines. A multi-hulled design fitted no fewer than five inner habitable hulls with two large main parallel hulls. She had nineteen compartments for control rooms, missile launch tubes and electronic equipment. The superstructure was coated with sound absorbent tiles.\n\r\nShe was the first SSBN to have her missile launch tubes installed forward of the sail and, with twenty RSM 52 intercontinental, three-stage, solid propellant ballistic missiles, she fielded more missiles than any of her contemporaries anywhere in the world. The plan for these behemoths was to hide in the North Atlantic waters and, if war came, the class would relocate to predetermined locations under the Arctic ice shelf. She could maintain this submerged position for up to 120 days or more, waiting for the \"go code\" to fire her missiles towards targets across the United States.  Each of the 20 missiles onboard had 10 independently targetable, multiple reentry MIRV's, each with a 100kt nuclear warhead - 200 warheads altogether.  The missiles had a range of 5,157miles (8,300km) and were able to hit a target within a 1,640ft (500m) area.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Dmitri Donskoi (TK-208)", "ship_type": "Ballistic Missile Submarine"}, {"id": "4c734971-8fa7-42fe-9d90-5d8a177f88b7", "year_model": "1980", "description": "\r\n        \tDuring the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained a healthy collection of submarines and surface warships. Included in this stable were the heavily-armed Kirov-class of battlecruisers which forced the United States to bring back their big-gunned World War 2-era Iowa-class battleships. The Kirov-class was led by the Kirov herself which saw her keel laid down on March 27th, 1974 at the Baltiysky Naval Shipyard of Leningrad. She was launched on December 26th, 1977 and formally commissioned on December 30th, 1980, officially identified by NATO observers the following year. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the heavy defense cuts that followed, the vessel was placed in reserve status in 1990.At one time destined for the scrap heap, the vessel was renamed in 1992 to Admiral Ushakov and a plan was later announced for refitting and modernizing the Kirov fleet for reinstatement into the new Russian Navy. The Admiral Ushakov is expected to be recommissioned for active service with the Russian Fleet sometime around 2020 should the modernization program proceed as planned.\n\r\nThe naval term \"battlecruiser\" emerged in the 20th Century when it classified large, battleship-type capital ships for naval powers of the day. The type was differentiated from battleships by their lighter armoring which added improved speed and performance. They maintained the firepower of battleships but could be used to hunt down slower moving, less fortunate vessels of other navies. While many powers eventually abandoned the battlecruiser naming convention after World War 2 (1939-1945), the Soviet Union, under Joseph Stalin's direction, retained their use hence the Kirov-class battlecruisers of the 1970s.\n\r\nAs built, the Kirov displaced some 28,000 tons under full load and sported a bow-to-stern length of 827 feet, a beam of 94 feet and draught of 30 feet. Propulsion came in a hybrid form consisting of 2 x nuclear-reactors coupled with steam-based turbines, the latter providing boosting power while the combined arrangement delivered 140,000 shaft horsepower to 2 x shafts. As such, the vessel could be expected to reach speeds of 32 knots in ideal conditions with an operational range of 1,000 nautical miles. However, her nuclear-based propulsion theoretically allowed for essentially unlimited operational ranges, governed only by onboard food stores. The vessel was crewed by 727 personnel including an air arm of some 18 personnel and officers numbering 15. Armor protection included up to 76mm thickness near key components - primarily the nuclear reactor.\n\r\nThe profile of the Kirov exhibited a split-superstructure with the primary form at amidships with a secondary structure just aft. The main structure held the main mast as well as the bridge and various sensor and communications installations. The forecastle was home to vertical launch cells for missile armament while the stern was completed with a helicopter flight deck. The smoke funnel was contained at the frontal superstructure and combined with the main mast assembly. The main mast was home to an air-search radar pairing while an air-surface search system and fire control system (FCS) were seated at the secondary mast structure. The bow exhibited a noticeable upwards angle which gave the Kirov a distinct appearance along the horizon.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Admiral Ushakov (Kirov)", "ship_type": "Nuclear-Powered Battlecruiser Warship"}, {"id": "3e71e18d-aaf8-421c-9a89-6799ea4acfac", "year_model": "1980", "description": "\r\n        \tLike many other leading naval powers of the world, the Russian Navy fields a healthy collection of destroyer warships - about thirteen in all - behind the United States (65), Japan (36) and China (29). Such ship types are built to be fast in the water and reach out to far-off destinations on internal fuel and can be used as independent solutions / deterrents or as part of the main fighting force. Flexibility-in-service is expanded by the type's ability to feature a flexible armament suite which allows the ships to tackle just about any at-sea threat - be it in the air, on the water, or under it.\n\nRussian Navy Destroyers\n\r\nThe Russian Navy currently (2018) operates three distinct batches of destroyer warships - the Kashin-class, Udaloy-class and Sovremennyy-class. The Sovremennyy-class (Project 956) numbered twenty-one ships when it was ultimately adopted and finally completed though only three of her number are in active service today (2018): Bystryy, Nastoychivyy and Admiral Ushakov commissioned in 1989, 1993 and 1994, respectively (Burnyy is said to be undergoing modernization as of this writing, 2018). All displace in the 7,940 ton range. Bystryy is assigned to the Pacific Fleet, Nastoychivyy to the Baltic Fleet and Admiral Ushakov to the Northern Fleet.\n\r\nAll were built by Severnaya Verf 190 of St. Petersburg.\n\r\nThe Sovremennyy-class was used to succeed the aging Kashin-class but was itself succeeded by the Lider-class. China adopted the design as well in the late-1990s/early-2000s.\n\nBackground\n\r\nThe submarine was the bread-and-butter instrument of the Soviet Navy throughout the Cold War but World War 2 (1939-1945) continue to influence post-war doctrine for all sides and revealed the value of surprise amphibious landings against an enemy. As such, the Soviet Navy was continually drawn up to include gun-laden warships to support such actions in far-away lands. New warships were taken from drawing boards to shipyards, including the Sovremennyy-class, and the \"multi-mission\" mindset for these ships soon was introduced to help evolve the line and keep them on par with American counterparts in the West.\n\nSpecifciations\r\nAs such, the group is designed for several key operating roles including airspace denial, anti-ship sorties and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). Displacement is 6,600 tons under standard load and 8,500 tons under full load. Dimensions include a running length of 511.9 feet with a beam of 56.8 feet and a draught of 21.3 feet. Power is from 4 x Boiler units feeding 2 x Steam turbines producing 100,000 horsepower to 2 x Shafts. 2 x Turbo-generators and 2 x Diesel generators complete the propulsion scheme.\n\r\nThe warships are able to range out to an impressive 16,000 miles and reach speeds nearing 33 knots in open sea under ideal conditions.\n\r\nAboard is a crew of 350 personnel. An air arm is part of the crew for the sole helipad can support a single Kamov Ka-27 \"Helix\" (or similar) navy helicopter equipped for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), anti-ship or at-sea replenishment roles.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Sovremennyy-class (Project 956 Sarych)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "d1b51015-0c34-4f19-bb49-e23ca0a4ef35", "year_model": "1977", "ship_name": "Tarantul / Project 1241/12411/1242 (class)", "ship_type": "Guided-Missile Corvette Warship"}, {"id": "dc89b55b-485f-452d-89c1-3f5e7d895902", "year_model": "1975", "description": "\r\n        \tThe modern Russian Navy continues to invest resources into fielding an effective amphibious fighting force and manages a healthy stable of amphibious support ship such as the Ropucha-class (Project 775).

The craft are shallow-draught, measuring just 12.2 feet deep. to better wade to within reach of shorelines and release their fighting cargo. Twenty-eight of the craft were completed with the first examples coming online in 1975 - while there still was a Cold War with the West. The last ships were taken into service in 1991.\n\r\nThe Ropucha-class craft were all constructed at the Stocznia Polnocna Shipyard at Gdansk, Poland during the Cold War period.\n\r\nThe landing ships displace 2,200 tons under standard load and up to 4,100 tons under full load. Each has a length of 369.10 feet with a beam measuring 49.2 feet. Drive power is from 2 x Marine diesels developing 19,200 horsepower to 2 x Shafts under stern.

Up to 313 infantry can be hauled or up to 500 tons of useful cargo in the form of supplies for establishing beachheads or supplying inland troops. Cargo is released through large doors found at the bow and stern of the ship with the vehicle deck running the entire length of the vessel.\n\r\nThe Ropucha-class ships have self-defense-minded weaponry installed, particularly to support shoreline actions and defend against low-flying threats. 2 x twin-barreled 57mm AK-257 autocannons are carried (Ropucha I ships only) as is a single 76mm turreted gun fit. To this is added 2 x 30 122mm A-215 series Grad-M rockets for area suppression. Strela-2 (SA-N-5) short-range surface-to-air missile launchers also aid in airspace deterrence. Close-in support is through 2 x 30mm AK-630 digital combat units sporting Gatling-style guns.\n\r\nTwo distinct forms of the Ropucha-class ships are in service - original Project 755 (known as \"Ropucha I\") vessels numbering twelve and modified/modernized Project 775M (known as \"Ropucha II\") vessels numbering three. The latter group can carry more infantry and has improved defensive armament to deal with more modern emerging threats.\n\r\nThe Ropucha-class craft are in service with the navies of Russia, Ukraine, and Yemen. Russian types were used in combat during the War in South Ossetia in 2008 against Georgia. Ukraine managed only one ship, U402 Kostiantyn Olshansky, but this example was later captured by Russian forces in its takeover of Crimea from Ukraine.

This series of large frigates was specifically designed to counter the new American missile-capable Polaris-class submarines. By 1975, Premier Leonid Brezhnev had spent vast sums of money upgrading the armed forces and the new Burevestnik ASW frigates were the pride of the Soviet Navy. Brezhnev felt the Soviets needed to keep pace with the American Navy, resulting in an ongoing arms race during the Cold War. \n\r\nWith Communist victories in Southeast Asia and Latin America and a booming national economy in Russia, many felt the Soviet Union appeared to be winning the Cold War. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union was at the peak of its power. The Communist Party remained the only political party in the Soviet Union and forced economic reforms allowed the Empire to have a strong economy and an increased standard of living for its citizens.\n\r\nThe NATO callsign for the new frigate class was the \"Krivak\" and the frigate Storozhevoy was attached to the Soviet Baltic Fleet based at Riga at the Gulf of Riga.  The design started in 1957 and developed into a large anti-submarine ship in the 1960s. A total of 40-plus ships were built for the Soviet Navy, the KGB Maritime Border Guard, Ukraine and India.  \n\r\nThe sleek design was 405 feet long and she weighed 3,300 tons. The vessel could make 32 knots with her gas turbines outputting at 40,000 horsepower.  She was on guard against the American submarine threat with upgraded radar - the Don Kay and Don 2. The Storozhevoy featured downward-looking \"Eye Bowl\" radar along with  the \"Pop Group\" sky-looking radar.  Her bow sonar was known as the \"Bull Nose\" and she towed a sonar array called the \"Mare Tail\" used in anti-submarine warfare sweeps.  \n\r\nThe ship's armament made her a tiger on the high seas with a bow-mounted anti-submarine RBU6000 missile box. She fielded 4 x 533mm torpedo tubes along her deck that would swing out to port and starboard at amidships to counter enemy subs at various angles.

The bow hull line was raised while the rest of the vessel featured a low line running unbroken to the stern. A second hull superstructure was fitted aft of the inline smoke funnels. There were to masts, one forward and one aft.\n\r\nPower stemmed from five boiler units feeding 2 x Brown Boverei turbines developing 25,500 horsepower to twin shafts. Maximum speed in ideal conditions reached 34 knots which gave the vessels good legs in open sea.\n\r\nArmament centered on 3 x 102mm (4\") main guns with 2 x 47mm (1.9\") Anti-Aircraft (AA) guns and 3 x 7.62mm machine guns. 10 x 457mm (18\") torpedo tubes were carried in five twin-tubed launcher sets. Up to eighty naval mines could also be carried and used to deny water routes to the enemy.\n\r\nDimensions included a running length of 321.5 feet with a beam of 30.5 feet and a draught of 10.5 feet. Displacement reached 1,100 tons under standard load and 1,350 tons under full load. Aboard was a crew of some 125 sailors.\n\r\nThe nine ships of the class were Bespokoiny, Derzky, Gnevny, Pronziteiny, Bystry (later renamed Frunze), Gromki, Pospeshny, Pylki and Schastivy. Construction of the group was split between several shiyards - Nikolayev Navy Yard, Metal Works (Kherson) and Putilov Yard. The first ships, Bespokoiny and Gnevny, were both launched on October 31st, 1913 with Gromki following on December 19th of that year. The remaining vessels were all in service for 1914.\n\r\nTheir operational tenure was heavily disrupted by the Russian Civil War (1917-1923) that all but ended Imperial Russian involvement in World War 1 and Imperial Russia as a whole. Many of the ships in the class were scuttled by their crews to avoid capture by the revolutionaries and were the last remnants of the Black Sea Fleet loyal to the Empire.\n\r\nOf the nine Derzky-class destroyers completed, three were lost in service. Bespokoiny was interned at Bizerte and scrapped in 1924 as was Dersky, Gnevny, Pospeshny and Pylki. Pronzitelny was scuttled on June 18th, 1918 near Novorosiysk as was Gromki. Schastiivy was run aground on October 24th, 1919 while under tow to its internment site. Bystry was scuttled by her crew in 1919 to avoid capture but eventually raised and reconstituted back into service with the newly-born Soviet Navy. It sailed into the 1940s where it was dive-bombed into history by German Stukas on September 21st, 1941.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Derzky-class (Bespokoiny-class)", "ship_type": "Destroyer Warship"}, {"id": "04c13593-8f66-417d-ba56-ceafe2a7cfd9", "year_model": "1905", "description": "\r\n        \tThe word \"Slava\" itself translates to \"Glory\" in Russian and her representative vessel was the last of the Borodino-class battleships to be built. She was launched in 1903 and commissioned in 1905, this timing making her a \"pre-dreadnought\" battleship.  Her class design was copied from the Russian battleship \"Tsesarevich\" which itself was constructed in France from a blueprint that was devised from a team of both French and Russian engineers. Due to the lack of shipbuilding space across Russia, many of her surface vessels were constructed through these foreign port arrangements. Slava was commissioned too late to take part in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 though the other four ships of her class were either sunk or surrendered by/to the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN).  After conclusion of hostilities, Russia had lost many of her capital ships, making Slava one of her most powerful vessels still operating with the Baltic Fleet.\n\r\nHer Krupp-brand steel belt armor was 5.9- to 9.0-inches (150-230mm) thick and her deck was covered over in 2.25-inches (57mm) of armor to protect against plunging fire. The 12-inch main gun turrets and their crews 10-inches (250mm) of armor while secondary 6-inch turrets received 5.9-inches (150mm) of armor. Along with the bridge, the conning tower was protected by up to 10-inches (250mm) of armor plate. \n\r\nAs a whole, Slava was 397 feet, 3 inches (121.08 meters) long and her beam was 76 feet, 1 inch (23.19 meters) along a draft of 29 feet, 2 inches (8.89 meters). Her displacement registered at 15,520 long tons. For steaming, Slava was equipped with a pair of 4-cylinder, vertical, triple expansion steam engines fueled by coal heating water across 20 tube boilers - both constructed by the Baltic Works Company. The engines outputted 15,800 ihp (11,782 kW) and produced 16,378 ihp (12,213 kW) resulting in a top speed of 17.64 knots (32.67 km/h; 20.30 mph). She could carry 1,350 long tons (1,370 tons) of coal that allowed her to steam out to 2,590 nautical miles (4,800 km) at a reduced speed of 10 knots (19 km/h) using her twin shafts with four-bladed screw propellers.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Slava", "ship_type": "Pre-Dreadnought Battleship"}, {"id": "dab5446f-e0c5-45b1-96ae-daaf1f55b2af", "year_model": "1903", "description": "\r\n        \tIn the late 1800s, Russia acquired Port Arthur in Manchuria (through coerced lease) and this was notable because it represented an ice-free port for its Navy with free access to the Pacific. To defend its control, Russian leader Tsar Nicholas II ordered several warships to be constructed with one of these becoming the Tsesarevich. Due to a lack of shipbuilding capabilities within Russia, the warship was constructed in France and delivered to the Russian Navy upon completion. Tsesarevich was ordered on July 20th, 1898 and built by Forges et Chantiers de la Mediterranee of France. Her keel was laid down on July 8th, 1899 and she was launched on February 23rd, 1901. Her commissioning followed on August 31st, 1903.\n\r\nThe Tsesarevich was a pre-Dreadnought battleship which predated the arrival of HMS Dreadnought (1906). HMS Dreadnought brought about the rise of the all-big-gun, steam powered capital ship and rendered mixed gun, coal-powered warships obsolete as a result. As such, Tsesarevich carried a mixed-gun armament consisting of 2 x 305mm (12\") main guns, 6 x 152mm (6\") secondary guns, 20 x 75mm (3\") guns, 20 x 47mm (1.9\") guns and 8 x 37mm (1.5\") guns. Additionally there were 4 x 381mm (15\") torpedo tubes fitted. Power was from 20 x Belleville boilers feeding 2 x Vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving 16,300 horsepower to 2 x Shafts. Maximum speed was 18 knots with a range out to 5,500 nautical miles.\n\r\nAs built, Tsesarevich exhibited a length of 388.8 feet, a beam of 76 feet and a draught of 26 feet. Her crew complement numbered 778 and armor protection reached 10\" at the conning tower. The belt held up to 9.8\" and the decks up to 2\". Her profile featured a forward set bridge superstructure, midships-based smoke funnels and a twin-mast arrangement. On the whole, her appearance was consistent with warship design of the late-1800s.\n\r\nAfter entering service in 1903, Tsesarevich was sent to the Far East and took up station in Port Arthur before the end of the year. She represented the more formidable warship in the Russian Navy fleet at the time and a considerable foe for Japan when the two nations went to war in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.\n\r\nIn the opening rounds of the conflict, Japanese torpedo boats struck the Russian fleet where it berthed on the night of February 8th - Tsesarevich being one of the targets. The vessel took a torpedo into her side that caused a noticeable list but counter-flooding was able to right the warship and keep it afloat. However, once she got moving, she ran aground at the port entrance and remained in her damaged state until June 7th. She then broke down while attempting to break the Japanese blockade and was part of several inconclusive actions against the Japanese fleet thereafter. It managed to reach the German treaty port of Tsingtau and was disarmed and interned for the duration of the war.\n\r\nThe vessel was then returned to Russia and formed part of the Baltic Fleet. In 1906 it took part in suppressing the Sveaborg rebellion, a Russian military mutiny born from the 1905 Russian Revolution.  That same year her profile changed some as her superstructure was shortened and she lost some of her 75mm guns. Her next participation was in response to the Messina earthquake in December of 1908. Her propulsion scheme was drastically updated from 1909 to 1910.\n\r\nTsesarevich was still in commission by the time of World War 1 (1914-1918) but saw little action in the conflict. There was another mutiny, this time involving Tsesarevich as a host ship, in the early part of 1917. Following the February Revolution, the warship was renamed to \"Grazhdanin\" on April 13th. Then came her participation in the Battle of Moon Sound during October 1917 which ended as a German victory in the Baltic Sea. Grazhdanin took several direct hits from German guns and retreated.\n\r\nBefore the end of the year, she was taken over by the Bolsheviks and retired by May 1918. She was scrapped in 1924 and her name was stricken from the Naval Register on November 21st, 1925.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Tsesarevich", "ship_type": "Predreadnought Battleship"}, {"id": "392e8a49-5976-4290-89e2-4f36bddb3bc1", "year_model": "1874", "description": "\r\n        \tThe idea of a circular battleship emerged in a 1868 report from Scottish shipbuilder John Elder and evolved by the Royal Navy's Edward Reed but not officially realized until Rear-Admiral Andrei Popov of the Russian Navy pressed home the concept. The design revolved around a shallow-draft vessel capable of traversing low-level waters such as rivers and lakes, giving it proper access to more battlefronts than traditional well-armed warships could ever reach. The concept also spread out the displacement of both armor and armament, leading to a (theoretically) more powerful warship than possible through conventional designs. The end result, however, became one of the most panned warships ever completed - the \"Novgorod\" which was to represent a class of such ships. Its circular hull did allow for the expected armoring and armament benefits but it suffered from stability in anything more than calm waters and accuracy of its main armament was left wanting.\n\r\nOnly one example of this unique, and mostly forgettable, ship was built for the Russian Navy.\n\r\nThe Novgorod was intended as a new class of Russian monitors to help protect Black Sea and Dnieper River positions. She was named after the Russian city of Novgorod and constructed by the New Admiralty Shipyard of Saint Petersburg from the span of 1871 until 1874. Her keel was laid down on December 29th, 1871 and she was launched to sea on June 2nd, 1873. Completed in 1874 she began formal service with the Russian Navy.\n\r\nOriginally Novgorod was developed along the lines of a monitor ironclad. Her dimensions included a length of 101 feet with a beam equaling that while her draught was just 13.5 feet. Displacement was 2,500 tons (long) and power was from six compound-expansion steam engines fed by eight boilers - all this driving six shafts (the outboard pair were removed in 1876-1877 due to their minimal propulsion benefits). At best, the ship could hope to make upwards of 6.5 knots in ideal conditions.\n\r\nTwo smoke funnels - one at port side and the other starboard - were fitted along the sides of the circular shape with the main armament seated at direct center. The wheelhouse was fitted over the rear section of the circle (added between 1873 and 1874) and elevated walkways (\"bridge wings\") were featured as extensions from the funnel towers. A large-area superstructure (housing crew quarters) was added to the bow section and hand rails ran around nearly the entire diameter of the hull. Primary armament was 2 x 11\" (280mm) guns though, while rifled, remained muzzle-loading weapons. A rotating turntable gave the guns their inherent traversal and could be aimed and fired jointly or independently of one another. Provisions were also made for carrying a \"spar\" torpedo weapon. Armor protection ranged from 9\" at the belt to 9 inches at the barbette. The deck offered up to 2.75\" of protection.\n\r\nNovgorod's first, and only real, call-to-arms came during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) where she was stationed at Odessa to act as a floating deterrent.  Additional armament was added at about this time, this in the form of 2 x 4-pounder (3.4\") cannon to improve her all-around defense - particularly against enemy torpedo boats which had grown to become a primary threat to capital ships. The war ended in March of 1878 with a Russian-Coalition victory.\n\r\nIn the post-war period, armor was added to her engine area and the main gun battery. In 1892 she was redesignated a \"coastal defense ironclad\" and had 2 x 37mm cannons added. From then on she made a few cruises in good weather periods but eventually deteriorated to the point that her services were no longer needed. She was struck from the Naval Register in July 1903 and sold for scrapping before the end of 1911.\n\r\nThus ended the idea of a circular metal-clad warship.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "Novgorod", "ship_type": "Circular Monitor Ironclad Warship"}, {"id": "bca17502-03ed-4682-adcf-b3a6d79af9ee", "year_model": "1869", "description": "\r\n        \tSMS Konig Wilhelm was originally ordered by the Ottoman Navy as \"Fatikh\" and saw her keel laid down in 1865 by Thames Iron Works of London. However, her future quickly changed when she was sold off to the Kingdom of Prussia in early 1867 but her eventually career would be with Germany after the demise of the Prussian Navy. Launched on April 25th, 1868. SMS Konig Wilhelm saw her construction end in 1869 and commission forthcoming on February 20th, 1869. When taken into service with the Prussian Navy, she made up the most powerful vessel in the fleet.\n\r\nThe warship displaced 10,755 tons (short) and featured a length of 368 feet, a beam of 60 feet and a draught of 28 feet. Her propulsion power came from 8 x trunk-style boilers feeding a single Maudslay, Son & Field (London) 2-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine driving a single shaft. She could make headway at nearly 15 knots in ideal conditions and held a range was out to 1,300 nautical miles. Despite her machinery the vessel was still outfitted with three sailing masts to help supplement her more onboard propulsion system - such was the warship design practice of the day.\n\r\nThe crew complement for Konig Wilhelm numbered 730 men. Armor protection reached up to 395mm thickness at the belt and 150mm thickness at the battery. Main armament originally 33 x 72-poundr guns but this later became 18 x 9.4\" (240mm) main guns backed by 5 x 8.3\" (210mm) secondary guns. Improvements to her armament suite also later included the addition of torpedo tubes and smaller-caliber gun installations.\n\r\nUnder Prussian ownership, the vessel originally carried the name of \"Wilhelm I\" but this was officially changed to \"Konig Wilhelm\" on December 14th, 1867. Due to her power and prestige, the warship quickly was made the flagship of the Prussian Navy. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War (1970-1871), the Konig Wilhelm was placed into action for the first time in her sailing career. However, the warship would see no direct combat in the conflict as her machinery was plagued with unreliability. In the post-war period, Konig Wilhelm suffered considerable damage when colliding with the ironclad Grosser Kurfurst. Repair work spanned from 1878 to 1882 at Wilhelmshaven.\n\r\nIn the decades following, Konig Wilhelm went on to serve in various roles that would see her become fleet flagship and a ceremonial platform as well as partake in training exercises. In 1895 she was placed in drydock and modified for the role of armored cruiser which revised (and improved) her armament fit. It was at this time that she lost her original sailing masts and saw a pair of pole masts take their place. The crew complement was also increased beyond 1,100 personnel.\n\r\nKonig Wilhelm re-entered German naval service in January of 1897 to which her career now took her to reserve status for 1904. While laying in harbor, she was given the role of barracks ship from 1904 until 1907. From there, she served as a floating training platform throughout World War 1 (1914-1918). While surviving the conflict, her days on the water were numbered and she fell to the scrapman's torch in the massive worldwide military drawdown that followed the conflict. Her name was struck from the Naval Register on January 4th, 1921 and her stripped hulk was soon sold for scrapping - bringing about an end to over fifty years of service to both the Prussian and German navies.\r\n\t\t", "ship_name": "SMS Konig Wilhelm (1869)", "ship_type": "Armored Frigate / Armored Cruiser Warship"}, {"id": "23f9ae2a-5357-4f92-a154-fc4227cb8079", "year_model": "1865", "description": "SMS Arminius", "ship_name": "SMS Arminius", "ship_type": "Ironclad Warship"}]}], "news": [{"title": "Ukraine planned attacks on Russian forces in Syria, leaked document shows", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/20/russia-ukraine-war-syria-attacks/", "date": "2023-04-20T18:53:45Z"}, {"title": "Ukraine war image of woman mortally wounded in Russian strike wins World Press Photo of the Year award - CBS News", "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdWtyYWluZS1ydXNzaWEtd2FyLXBob3RvLXByZWduYW50LXdvbWFuLW1hcml1cG9sLXdvcmxkLXByZXNzLXBob3RvLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLWF3YXJkL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3VrcmFpbmUtcnVzc2lhLXdhci1waG90by1wcmVnbmFudC13b21hbi1tYXJpdXBvbC13b3JsZC1wcmVzcy1waG90by1vZi10aGUteWVhci1hd2FyZC8?oc=5", "date": "2023-04-20T15:18:00+00:00"}, {"title": "Ukrainian counteroffensive looms as Putin leans on Wagner", "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/20/ukrainian-counteroffensive-looms-as-putin-leans-on-wagner", "date": "2023-04-20T14:59:31Z"}, {"title": "US, Ukraine Allies Consider Export Ban for Russia Over Putin\u2019s War in Ukraine", "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIzLTA0LTIwL3VzLXVrcmFpbmUtYWxsaWVzLWNvbnNpZGVyLWV4cG9ydC1iYW4tZm9yLXJ1c3NpYS1vdmVyLXB1dGluLXMtd2FyLWluLXVrcmFpbmXSAQA?oc=5", "date": "2023-04-20T12:00:00+00:00"}, {"title": "Exclusive: The Russian military commandant who oversaw reign of fear in Ukraine town", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-military-commandant-who-oversaw-reign-fear-ukraine-town-2023-04-20/", "date": "2023-04-20T09:55:24Z"}, {"title": "Ukrainian ballerina who fled after Russia's invasion stars in Swan Lake in Budapest", "url": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-03/ukrainian-ballerina-takes-the-stage-in-swan-lake/102132450", "date": "2023-04-02T20:02:34Z"}, {"title": "Leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Romania in Ukraine to support fight against Russia", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-leaders-of-germany-france-italy-romania-in-ukraine-to-support-fight/", "date": "2022-06-16T10:05:33Z"}, {"title": "Ukraine war drives lawmakers into defensive posture on Taiwan", "url": "https://thehill.com/policy/international/3259763-ukraine-war-drives-lawmakers-into-defensive-posture-on-taiwan/", "date": "2022-04-06T10:00:00Z"}]}
